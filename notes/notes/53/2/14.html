the call at that point of time when the men first hear the gospel. (See <a href="/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">By our gospel</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, of course, “by our bringing you the happy message”—the historical delivery of the message is dwelt on rather than its contents.<p><span class= "bld">To the obtaining of the glory of our Lord.</span>—Almost all the ancient commentators render it, “for obtaining of glory to our Lord;” and St. Chrysostom says, beautifully:” No small thing this either, if Christ esteems our salvation His glory. It is, indeed, a glory to the lover of men that the number of those who are being saved should be large.” But this version is not so easy grammatically as our own, nor does it suit so well with the context. St. Paul is encouraging his readers with the same thought of their destiny which he has put forward in <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm" title="Why also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:">2Thessalonians 1:11-12</a>—the identity of the joy of the Redeemer and the redeemed (<a href="/matthew/25-23.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:23</a>). It is well to be observed that God did not call them straight “to the glory of our Lord,” but “to the obtaining” of the same. This “obtaining” does not mean an otiose receiving of glory in the last day, but a laborious course of “earning” or “purchasing” it during this life. The word is the same as that used in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1Thessalonians 5:9</a>, where see Note.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 When we hear of the apostacy of many, it is a great comfort and joy, that there is a remnant according to the election of grace, which does and shall persevere; especially we should rejoice, if we have reason to hope that we are of that number. The preservation of the saints, is because God loved them with an everlasting love, from the beginning of the world. The end and the means must not be separated. Faith and holiness must be joined together as well as holiness and happiness. The outward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered effectual by the inward working of the Spirit. The belief of the truth brings the sinner to rely on Christ, and so to love and obey him; it is sealed by the Holy Spirit upon his heart. We have no certain proof of any thing having been delivered by the apostles, more than what we find contained in the Holy Scriptures. Let us then stand fast in the doctrines taught by the apostles, and reject all additions, and vain traditions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whereunto he called you by our gospel - He made the gospel as preached by us the means of calling you to salvation.

They are those two sovereign acts of God, prerequisite to a state of salvation; the one eternal, the other in time; the one immanent in God, the other transient upon the creature; and it is the first transient act that flows from election. And because there is an outward and inward civil mentioned in Scripture, we must here understand the apostle of both: for Eiv o: <span class="ital">Whereunto, </span> or to which thing, mentioned in the beginning of this verse, refers to all that he said in the former verse, which is, <span class="ital">salvation, sanctification, belief of the truth, </span> which they could not attain with a mere outward call, though they had that also; for the apostle mentions here the gospel, which he calls <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">our gospel, </span> because preached by them, and intrusted to them, though the original of it is from God, and the matter of it from Jesus Christ. And he puts them in mind of the great mercy they had received in their preaching the gospel to them, for thereby they were called into a state of salvation; as also of the way wherein they are to obtain this salvation, which is <span class="ital">through sanctification of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth, </span> that they might be careful to persevere both in faith and holiness; and not to expect it from the law, or the speculations of philosophy, which some false teachers might suggest, for as <span class="ital">faith cometh by hearing the gospel, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a></span>, so it is that only which is <span class="ital">the power of God unto salvation, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a></span>. And by this he confirms to them also their election, because they had been thus effectually called by the gospel: for no man can conclude his salvation from election, if he hath not been also thus called, which is by feeling the power of the gospel in the heart, and yielding obedience to it in his life. What the apostle before called <span class="ital">salvation, </span> he here styles <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Though in <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a></span>, he had there also called it obtaining salvation, and by the same word here used in the text: yea, the word peripoihsiv, here rendered obtaining, sometimes signifies salvation itself, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a></span>, and, which is equivalent, <span class="ital">the purchased possession, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a></span>; and it may signify in the text, the obtaining the glory of Christ in a way of purchase, as also by diligent endeavours after it, by way of acquisition, as the word seems to signify. And by <span class="ital">the glory of Christ</span> is not meant the glory we give to him, as some would strain the words to that sense; but rather, the glory we shall receive from him, which is the same which the Father hath given to him, and which he hath given to his people. <span class="bld"><a href="/john/17-22.htm" title="And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:">John 17:22</a></span>, whereby they are co-heirs with him, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a></span>. And so the apostle sets forth the greatness of this salvation, to which these believers were called, it is to the obtaining the same glory with Christ, in kind at least; and shows their different state from those that perish, and will be damned, mentioned in the former verses. Or if we read the words, ye are called to be a peculiar people, as the Greek word is so rendered, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a></span>, laov eiv piripoihsin, <span class="ital">a peculiar people, </span> and understand by <span class="ital">the glory of Christ, </span> that glory of his grace he hath manifested herein, it shows also how God hath distinguished them from those before mentioned. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whereunto he called you by our Gospel,.... Salvation being appointed as the end in the decree of election, and sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, as means; the elect in the effectual calling are called to the participation of each of these; first to the one, and then to the other; to grace here, and glory hereafter: and the means by which they are called is the Gospel, which the apostle calls "our Gospel", not because they were the authors, or the subject of it; for with regard to these it is styled the Gospel of God, and the Gospel of Christ; but because they were intrusted with it, and faithfully preached it, and in opposition to another Gospel published by false teachers. And by this they were called <p>to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ; not his essential glory, though he will be seen and known in the glory of his person as he is, so far as creatures in a state of perfection will be capable of; nor his mediatorial glory, though it will be one part of the saints' happiness in heaven to behold this glory of Christ; but rather the glory which shall be personally put upon the saints, both in soul and body, in the resurrection morn, is here intended: and which is called the glory of Christ, because it is in his hands for them; and is what he is preparing for them, and for which he gives them both a right and a meetness; and which he at last will introduce them into; and it will lie greatly in conformity to him, and in the everlasting vision and enjoyment of him: and now God's elect are called by the ministry of the word to "the obtaining" of this, not by any merit of theirs, or by any works of righteousness done by them, but to the "possession" of it, as the word used properly signifies. The Syriac version renders it, "that ye may be a glory to our Lord Jesus Christ": as the saints will be at the last day, and to all eternity, when they shall be raised again, and have the glory of God upon them, and be forever with the Lord. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whereunto he called you by our <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><p>(r) By our preaching.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς ὅ</span>] <span class="ital">to which</span>.

So in essentials, Pelagius, Musculus, Hunnius, Piscator, Vorstius, Grotius, Wolf, Schott, Olshausen, de Wette, Alford, Ewald, Bisping, Riggenbach, and others. Less suitably, because weakening the force and the important contents of the expression, Luc. Osiander, Benson, Moldenhauer, and Pelt explain <span class="greekheb">δόξα τοῦ κυρίου</span> of the glory, of which Christ is the <span class="ital">source</span> or <span class="ital">bestower</span>. Against the reference to <span class="ital">God</span> as the <span class="ital">subject</span> in <span class="greekheb">περιποίησιν</span>, and to <span class="ital">Christ</span> as the <span class="ital">receiver</span> of the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> (Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα δόξαν περιποιήσῃ τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ</span>; Theophylact, Vatablus, Cornelius a Lapide), is the circumstance, that although <span class="greekheb">εἰς περιποίησιν</span> might stand instead of <span class="greekheb">εἰς τό</span> with the infinitive, yet the <span class="ital">dative</span> <span class="greekheb">τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν</span> would require to be placed instead of the genitive <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν</span>. Lastly, the <span class="ital">passive</span> signification of <span class="greekheb">περιποίησις</span>: “ut essetis gloriosa possessio domini nostri Jesu Christi” (Menochius, Harduin; also Luther: “to the glorious inheritance,” and Calvin), has against it the weakening of the substantive <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span> into an adjective, and the parallel passage in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>.

This is the goal of their salvation, “the prize of their high calling” (<a href="/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Php 3:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Obtaining</span> of glory” is therefore synonymous with the “<span class="ital">obtaining</span> of salvation” of <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>, where the same rare verbal noun is used (see note). Christ’s glory is already won in principle, in its ground and beginning, both for Himself and His people. So He said, leaving the world, “Now <span class="ital">was</span> the Son of Man <span class="ital">glorified</span>” (<a href="/john/13-31.htm" title="Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.">John 13:31</a>); yet He prays further, “Now, O Father, glorify Thou Me;” while He says of His disciples, “The glory which Thou hast given Me, I have given them” (<a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/john/17-22.htm" title="And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:">John 17:22</a>). His glory is ever advancing and, as it unfolds itself, ever anew imparting itself to men, till it is <span class="ital">consummated</span> in “the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven” (ch. <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,...">2 Thessalonians 1:7-12</a>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; comp. <a href="/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm" title="And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.">Matthew 24:30</a>, &c.). Then the glory of His saints will be complete and secure, in the completeness of His: “with Him in glory” (<a href="/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>; comp. <a href="/context/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:...">Php 3:20-21</a>; and His own words in <a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>). “We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is” (<a href="/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς ὅ</span>, <span class="ital">Whereunto</span>) The phrase, <span class="ital">to salvation</span>, is hereby explained.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς περιποίησιν</span>, [<span class="ital">to the obtaining</span>, Engl.
