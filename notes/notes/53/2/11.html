Every wilful sin does this double mischief: it strengthens the power of the temptation without; it weakens the power to resist within. For an illustration, see <a href="/2_chronicles/18-7.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good to me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.

This inward work of error is sent “with a view to their believing <span class= "ital">the</span> lie” (the Greek has the definite article)—the lie (that is) which Antichrist would have them believe. A terrible combination when God and Satan are agreed to deceive a man! Yet what an encouragement to see God using Satan for His own purposes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:...">2 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this cause God shall send them </span>— That is, shall judicially permit to come upon them; <span class="ital">strong delusion </span>— The strong working of error in their hearts. From this we learn that, as a punishment of their sins, God suffers wicked men to fall into greater sins; and as the sin of the persons described in this passage consisted in their not loving the truth, what could be more just or proper than to punish them, by suffering them to fall into the belief of the greatest errors and lies? Thus the heathen, mentioned <a href="/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a>, were punished by God’s <span class="ital">giving them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts; that they should believe a lie </span>— Or, as the words <span class="greekheb">εις το πιστευσαι αυτους τω ψευδει </span>may be translated, <span class="ital">so that they will believe a lie. </span>The lie here intended by the Spirit of God, Macknight thinks, “is the monstrous lie of transubstantiation, or of the conversion of the bread and wine in the Lord’s supper into the real identical body and blood of Christ, through the will of the priest accompanying his pronouncing the words of institution; notwithstanding there is no change whatever produced in the accidents or sensible qualities of these substances. This impudent fiction is not only a palpable contradiction to the senses and reason of mankind, but a most pernicious falsehood, being the chief foundation of that fictitious power of pardoning sin, and of saving or damning men according to their own pleasure, which the Romish ecclesiastics have blasphemously arrogated to themselves, and by which they make men utterly negligent of holiness, and of all the ordinary duties of life.” <span class="ital">That they all might be damned </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ινα κριθωσι</span>, <span class="ital">might be judged, </span>or condemned; that is, the consequence of which will be, that, having filled up the measure of their iniquity, they will at length fall into just condemnation; <span class="ital">who believed not the truth </span>— Received not the gospel in faith, love, and obedience; <span class="ital">but had pleasure in unrighteousness </span>— In corrupt passions and vicious practices. The original expression, <span class="greekheb">ευδοκησαντες </span>signifies both to take pleasure in a thing, and to approve of it. “From this we learn that it is not the simple ignorance of truth which exposes men to damnation. In many cases this may be no fault in the ignorant. But it is men’s refusing to believe, through their taking pleasure in unrighteousness, which will prove fatal to them; for a disposition of that sort renders the wicked altogether incurable.” Such is the interpretation which Bishop Newton, in his admirable work on the Prophecies, Dr. Macknight, and many other approved commentators, have given of this famous prophecy; an interpretation which applies with great ease to all the facts and circumstances mentioned in it, and is perfectly consistent in all its parts, which no other interpretation invented by learned men can be shown to be. The passage is evidently a prediction, as the above-mentioned divines have fully proved, of the corruptions of Christianity, “which began to be introduced into the church in the apostle’s days, and wrought secretly all the time the heathen magistrates persecuted the Christians, but which showed themselves more openly after the empire received the faith of Christ, A.D. 312, and by a gradual progress ended in the monstrous errors and usurpations of the bishops of Rome, when the restraining power of the emperors was taken out of the way, by the incursions of the barbarous nations, and the breaking of the empire into the ten kingdoms prefigured by the ten horns of Daniel’s fourth beast.” To be convinced of this, the reader need only compare the rise and progress of the Papal tyranny with the descriptions of the <span class="ital">man of sin, </span>and of <span class="ital">the mystery of iniquity </span>here given, and with the prophecies of Daniel. In the bishops of Rome all the characters and actions ascribed by Daniel to <span class="ital">the little horn, </span>and by Paul to <span class="ital">the lawless one, </span>are clearly united. “For, according to the strong working of Satan, with all power and signs, and miracles of falsehood, they have opposed Christ, and exalted themselves above all that is called God, or an object of worship; and have long sat in the temple of God as God, showing themselves that they are God; that is, they exercise the power and prerogatives of God. And seeing, in the acquisition and exercise of their spiritual tyranny, they have trampled upon all laws, human and divine, and have encouraged their votaries in the most enormous acts of wickedness, the Spirit of God hath, with the greatest propriety, given them the appellations of <span class="ital">the man of sin, the son of perdition, </span>and <span class="ital">the lawless one. </span>Further, as it is said that the man of sin was to be <span class="ital">revealed in his season, </span>there can be little doubt that the dark ages, in which all learning was overturned by the irruption of the northern barbarians, were the season allotted to the man of sin for revealing himself. Accordingly we know that in these ages the corruptions of Christianity, and the usurpations of the clergy, were carried to the greatest height. In short, the annals of the world cannot produce persons and events, to which the things written in this passage can be applied with so much fitness, as to the bishops of Rome. Why then should we be in any doubt concerning the interpretation and application of this famous prophecy?” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-12 Something hindered or withheld the man of sin. It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And for this cause - Because they choose error, or their hearts love that more than they do truth. The original reason then of their embracing and adhering to the system was not an arbitrary decree on the part of God, but that they did not love the truth. Hence, he gave them up to this system of error. If a man strongly prefers error to truth, and sin to holiness, it is not wrong to allow him freely to evince his own preference.<p>God shall send them strong delusion - Greek: "energy of deceit;" a Hebraism, meaning strong deceit, The agency of God is here distinctly recognised, in accordance with the uniform statements of the Scriptures, respecting evil; compare <a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-20.htm">Exodus 10:20</a>, <a href="/exodus/10-27.htm">Exodus 10:27</a>; <a href="/exodus/11-10.htm">Exodus 11:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>. <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>. On the nature of this agency, see the notes on <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>. It is not necessary here to suppose that there was any positive influence on the part of God in causing this delusion to come upon them, but all the force of the language will be met, as well as the reasoning of the apostle, by supposing that God withdrew all restraint, and suffered men simply to show that they did not love the truth. God often places people in circumstances to develop their own nature, and it cannot be shown to be wrong that He should do so. If people have no love of the truth, and no desire to be saved, it is not improper that they should be allowed to manifest this. How it happened that they had no "love of the truth," is a different question, to which the remarks of the apostle do not appertain; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, note.<p>That they should believe a lie - This does not affirm that God wished them to believe a lie; nor that He would not have preferred that they should believe the truth; nor that He exerted any direct agency to cause them to believe a lie. It means merely that He left them, because they did not love the truth, to believe what was false, and what would end in their destruction. Can anyone doubt that this constantly occurs in the world? People are left to believe impostors; to trust to false guides; to rely on unfounded information; to credit those who live to delude and betray the innocent; and to follow those who lead them to ruin. God does not interpose by direct power to preserve them. Can anyone doubt this? Yet this is not especially the doctrine of revelation. The fact pertains just as much to the infidel as it does to the believer in Christianity, and he is just as much bound to explain it as the Christian is. It belongs to our world - to us all - and it should not be charged on Christianity as a doctrine pertaining especially to that system. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. for this cause&#8212;because "they received not the love of the truth." The best safeguard against error is "the love of the truth."<p>shall send&#8212;Greek, "sends," or "is sending"; the "delusion" is already beginning. God judicially sends hardness of heart on those who have rejected the truth, and gives them up in righteous judgment to Satan's delusions (Isa 6:9, 10; Ro 1:24-26, 28). They first cast off the love of the truth, then God gives them up to Satan's delusions, then they settle down into "believing the lie": an awful climax (1Ki 22:22, 23; Eze 14:9; Job 12:16; Mt 24:5, 11; 1Ti 4:1).<p>strong delusion&#8212;Greek, "the powerful working of error," answering to the energizing "working of Satan" (2Th 2:9); the same expression as is applied to the Holy Ghost's operation in believers: "powerful" or "effectual (energizing) working" (Eph 1:19).<p>believe a lie&#8212;rather, "the lie" which Antichrist tells them, appealing to his miracles as proofs of it &#8230; (2Th 2:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion:</span> we had account in the former verse of such as are deceived by the man of sin, of their sin, and here of their punishment. They were first deluded, which was their sin; and God sends them strong delusion, and that is their punishment. They did not receive the truth in the love of it, which was their sin; and therefore are given up to believe a lie, which is their punishment. Had they received the truth aright, they might have been saved; but not receiving it, they are damned. And they were said to be such as perish, and their perishing is here called damnation. So that though God is not the author of sin or falsehood: <span class="ital">Deus non est auctor cujus est ultor, </span> Fulgent.; yet he may in justice give men up to them, which the apostle here calls God’s sending, &c.; which imports either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Tradition, delivering men to Satan to tempt and deceive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Desertion, withholding or withdrawing that grace that might preserve them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. A judicial permission, God purposing not to hinder men to fall into that sin or delusion which he seeth their own hearts incline them to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God concurs to evil, not <span class="ital">positive, </span> but <span class="ital">privative; </span> not <span class="ital">efficienter, </span> but deficienter; Schoolmen.

They were deceived into error, and God gave them up to it. And it did work with great efficacy; which either relates to the man of sin, that did lead them strongly into it, or to them that were led by him. When error doth vitiate the life, and one error begets another, and makes men violent against the truth, then it is the efficacy of error. And thus God doth judicially punish sin with sin, and delusion with delusion; and then they are always most operative, and most incurable. But men fall not presently under these judicial acts; men first refitse to see, before God sends blindness, and first harden their own hearts, before God hardens them. These in the text first refused to receive the truth, before they were given up to believe a lie: see <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a></span>. So that both God and this man of sin, and themselves also, are concerned in these evils; but they sinfully and unrighteously, but God judicially and in righteousness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they should believe a lie:</span> and the lie they were given up to believe, is a doctrinal lie: false speaking is a lie in words, hypocrisy is a lie in fact, and error is a lie in doctrine, <span class="bld"><a href="/hosea/11-12.htm" title="Ephraim compasses me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the saints.">Hosea 11:12</a> <a href="/acts/5-3.htm" title="But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?">Acts 5:3</a></span>.

So that they call evil good, and good evil, and do not appear to have the common sense and reason of mankind, at least do not act according to it; and by giving them up to judicial blindness and hardness of heart, and to the god of this world, to blind their minds; and without this it is not to be accounted for, that the followers of antichrist should give into such senseless notions as those of transubstantiation, works of supererogation, &amp;c., or into such stupid practices as worshipping of images, praying to saints departed, and paying such a respect to the pretended relics of saints, &amp;c., as they do; but a spirit of slumber is given them, and eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, because of their rejection of the Gospel: and <p>that they should believe a lie; that the pope is Christ's vicar on earth, and has power to forgive sins; that the bread and wine in the Lord's supper are transubstantiated into the very body and blood of Christ; with other lying tenets spoken in hypocrisy concerning good works, merit, pardon, penance; &amp;c. with a multitude of lying wonders and false miracles, of which their legends are full; and this is the first and more near end of strong delusion or efficacious error being sent them; the more remote and ultimate one follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And for this cause God shall send them <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:</span><p>(n) A most mighty working to deceive them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ διὰ τοῦτο</span>] <span class="ital">and on this account</span>, refers to <span class="greekheb">ἀνθʼ ὧν τὴν ἀγάπην τῆς ἀληθείας οὐκ ἐδέξαντο</span>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2 Thessalonians 2:10</a>, and <span class="greekheb">καί</span> serves to bring forward the reciprocal relation between cause and effect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πέμπει αὐτοῖς ὁ Θεός</span>] the <span class="ital">present</span> is chosen, because according to <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a> the beginnings of lawlessness even now appeared.

Three things must be borne in mind here: (1) that Satan is never represented in Scripture as an independent power, or rival deity of evil, like the Persian Ahriman. However large the activity allowed to him in this world, it is under Divine control (see Job 1, 2; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; &c.). (2) St Paul teaches that <span class="ital">God makes sin work out its own punishment</span>. In <a href="/context/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:...">Romans 1:24-25</a>, he represents the loathsome vice of the Pagan world as a Divine chastisement for its long-continued idolatry: “<span class="ital">For this cause</span> God sends eftectual delusion” is parallel to “<span class="ital">For this cause</span> God gave them up to vile passions.” In each case the result is inevitable, and comes about by what we now call a natural law. That persistent rejection of truth destroys the sense of truth and results in fatal error, is an ethical principle and a fact of experience as certain as any in the world. Now he who believes in God as the Moral Ruler of the Universe, knows that its laws are the expression of His will. Since this Satanic delusion is the moral consequence of previous and wilful rejection of the truth, it is manifest that God is here at work; He makes Satan and the Lawless One His instruments in punishing false-hearted men. As they loved lies, God “sends them” lies for their portion. Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/14-9.htm" title="And if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on him, and will destroy him from the middle of my people Israel.">Ezekiel 14:9</a>, and 1 Kings 22. “Righteous and true are Thy ways, Thou King of the ages!” (<a href="/revelation/15-3.htm" title="And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints.">Revelation 15:3</a>). (3) The advents of Christ and of Antichrist are linked together (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a></span>); they are parts of the same great process and drama of judgement. God sends “the working of error” in the Lawless One, Who will quickly send His Son to be Judge of the lawless and Avenger of His elect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For “a lie” the Greek reads “<span class="ital">the</span> lie” (same word as <span class="ital">falsehood</span>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), which probably means here not falsehood in general, but this particular falsehood—“the lie” <span class="ital">par excellence</span>, in which all previous delusions of Satan are consummated, viz. that the Lawless One is himself God (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,...">2 Thessalonians 2:9-10</a></span>). Similarly Idolatry is called “the (great) lie,” in contrast with “the truth of God” (<a href="/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
