If it were possible for them to quit their ground, and yet be as well off after all, it would be needless also. At the same time, the “therefore” draws a conclusion, not from <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2Thessalonians 2:14</a> alone, but sums up the whole disquisition of the chapter: “Now that you are reminded of the true Advent doctrine.”<p><span class= "bld">Hold the traditions.</span>—The very same word as in <a href="/context/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3-4</a>; <a href="/mark/7-8.htm" title="For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you do.">Mark 7:8</a>, “holding the tradition of the elders;” also in the same metaphorical sense in <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>. The action expressed is a vigorous and pertinacious grasp, as (for instance) of the lame man clutching the Apostles in <a href="/acts/3-11.htm" title="And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.">Acts 3:11</a>. St. Chrysostom remarks: “It is plain from hence that they used not to deliver all their tradition by letter, but much without writing besides, and that both are equally worthy of belief. Therefore, let us consider the Church’s tradition worthy of belief. It is tradition: ask no further questions.” What were these “traditions” which it was so essential to keep? The context shows that the particular traditions which were most consciously in St. Paul’s mind at the moment, were his eschatological teachings, given to them while he was among them—the lore of which he has been briefly reminding them in this chapter (<a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2Thessalonians 2:5-6</a>): for the exhortation is practically a resumption of that given in <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2-3</a>. “Instead of being seduced by the forgers of prophecies or of communications from us, remember the careful instructions we gave you once for all.” At the same time, he speaks generally, and we must not limit his words to that particular tradition. <span class= "ital">Whatever</span> can be traced to apostolic-origin is of the essence of the faith. They are to “hold tenaciously” <span class= "ital">all</span> his traditions, and these would include instructions doctrinal (as <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="/jude/1-3.htm" title="Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.">Jude 1:3</a>), ceremonial (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1Corinthians 11:23</a>), and moral (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-21.htm" title="For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.">2Peter 2:21</a>). As a matter of controversy, it is not so remarkable that he should exhort his converts to cling to his own oral teaching (“whether by word”) as that he should at so early a period call their special attention to what was gradually to supplant (at least, in doctrinal matters) all independent unwritten tradition—the Holy Scripture (“our Epistle”). St. Paul can speak on occasion as contemptuously of the “traditions of men” as our Lord did (<a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>). Of course, it depends entirely on the individual character of any tradition whether, and to what extent, it is to be “held” or condemned as “human.” In the Church no mutually contradictory traditions can be held together’; and therefore any tradition “by word” which is in disagreement with the written tradition (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Scripture) stands necessarily condemned.<p><span class= "bld">By word, or our epistle.</span>—The “our” belongs <span class= "ital">to</span> both:” whether by word or epistle of ours.” Unless, St. Paul had written them some other letter, now lost, this proves that the “First” Epistle was in reality the earlier written. “Have been taught” should be “we<span class= "ital">re</span> taught”—the historic tense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter....">2 Thessalonians 2:15-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Therefore, brethren, stand fast — </span>In your adherence to the truth and possession of the grace of the gospel; <span class="ital">and hold </span>— Without adding to or diminishing from them; <span class="ital">the traditions which ye have been taught </span>— The instructions which have been delivered to you; <span class="ital">whether by word </span>— When we were present with you; <span class="ital">or our </span>former <span class="ital">epistle </span>— He preached to them before he wrote, and he had written concerning the things which he wished them to hold fast in his former epistle. The name <span class="ital">traditions </span>is here given by the apostle “to the doctrines and precepts of the gospel, on a double account; first, because they were delivered by Christ and by the Spirit to the apostles, merely on the authority of revelation; and, secondly, because the apostles delivered them to the world on the same authority, without attempting to prove them by any other argument. And this precept, <span class="ital">hold the traditions, </span>applies to no instructions or directions but those which the apostles and other inspired teachers delivered to the world as revelations from God. And though the inspired teachers, to whom these doctrines were revealed, communicated them to the world first of all by word of mouth, they cannot now be known to be theirs, but by their holding a place in those writings which are allowed to be the genuine productions of these inspired teachers. The traditions, therefore, on which the Church of Rome lays so great a stress, are of no manner of value.” <span class="ital">Now our Lord Jesus Christ and God our Father </span>— Here again, as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.">1 Thessalonians 3:11</a>, prayer is addressed by the apostle to Christ as well as to the Father, and in the same words; <span class="ital">who hath loved us </span>— As a father loves his children; <span class="ital">and hath given us everlasting consolation </span>— Hath opened to us the sources thereof in his gospel, or furnished us with the means of it; and of <span class="ital">good hope </span>— That is, a well-grounded hope, namely, of the glorification of both our bodies and souls; <span class="ital">through grace </span>— 1st, Justifying us, and entitling us to that felicity; 2d, Sanctifying us, and preparing us for it; and, 3d, Strengthening us, and enabling us to withstand our spiritual enemies, and do and suffer the will of God to the end, and thereby bringing us to it. <span class="ital">Comfort your hearts </span>— Under all the afflictions you endure for the gospel; <span class="ital">and establish you in every good word and work</span> — That is, in every good doctrine and practice, in opposition to all the efforts of your enemies to seduce you, whether visible or invisible. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 When we hear of the apostacy of many, it is a great comfort and joy, that there is a remnant according to the election of grace, which does and shall persevere; especially we should rejoice, if we have reason to hope that we are of that number. The preservation of the saints, is because God loved them with an everlasting love, from the beginning of the world. The end and the means must not be separated. Faith and holiness must be joined together as well as holiness and happiness. The outward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered effectual by the inward working of the Spirit. The belief of the truth brings the sinner to rely on Christ, and so to love and obey him; it is sealed by the Holy Spirit upon his heart. We have no certain proof of any thing having been delivered by the apostles, more than what we find contained in the Holy Scriptures. Let us then stand fast in the doctrines taught by the apostles, and reject all additions, and vain traditions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - In view of the fact that you are thus chosen from eternity, and that you are to be raised up to such honor and glory.<p>Stand fast - Amidst all the temptations which surround you; compare the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-14</a>. And hold the traditions which ye have been taught On the word "traditions," see the notes on <a href="/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>. It means properly things delivered over from one to another; then anything orally delivered - any precept, doctrine, or law. It is frequently employed to denote that which is not written, as contradistinguished from that which is written (compare <a href="/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>), but not necessarily or always; for here the apostle speaks of the "traditions which they had been taught by his epistle;" compare the notes, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>. Here it means the doctrines or precepts which they had received from the apostle, whether when he was with them, or after he left them; whether communicated by preaching or by letter. This passage can furnish no authority for holding the "traditions" which have come down from ancient times, and which profess to have been derived from the apostles; because:<p>(1) there is no evidence that any of those traditions were given by the apostles;<p>(2) many of them are manifestly so trifling, false, and contrary to the writings of the apostles, that they could not have been delivered by them;<p>(3) if any of them are genuine, it is impossible to separate them from those which are false;<p>(4) we have all that is necessary for salvation in the written word; and,<p>(5) there is not the least evidence that the apostle here meant to refer to any such thing.<p>He speaks only of what had been delivered to them by himself, whether orally or by letter; not of what was delivered from one to another as from him. There is no intimation here that they were to hold anything as from him which they had not received directly from him, either by his own instructions personally or by letter. With what propriety, then, can this passage be adduced to prove that we are to hold the traditions which professedly come to us through a great number of intermediate persons? Where is the evidence here that the church was to hold those unwritten traditions, and transmit them to future times?<p>Whether by word - By preaching, when we were with you. It does not mean that he had sent any oral message to them by a third person.<p>Or our epistle - The former letter which he had written to them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Therefore&#8212;God's sovereign choice of believers, so far from being a ground for inaction on their part, is the strongest incentive to action and perseverance in it. Compare the argument, Php 2:12, 13, "Work out your own salvation, FOR it is God which worketh in you," &c. We cannot fully explain this in theory; but to the sincere and humble, the practical acting on the principle is plain. "Privilege first, duty afterwards" [Edmunds].<p>stand fast&#8212;so as not to be "shaken or troubled" (2Th 2:2).<p>hold&#8212;so as not to let go. Adding nothing, subtracting nothing [Bengel]. The Thessalonians had not held fast his oral instructions but had suffered themselves to be imposed upon by pretended spirit-revelations, and words and letters pretending to be from Paul (2Th 2:2), to the effect that "the day of the Lord was instantly imminent."<p>traditions&#8212;truths delivered and transmitted orally, or in writing (2Th 3:6; 1Co 11:2; Greek, "traditions"). The Greek verb from which the noun comes, is used by Paul in 1Co 11:23; 15:3. From the three passages in which "tradition" is used in a good sense, Rome has argued for her accumulation of uninspired traditions, virtually overriding God's Word, while put forward as of co-ordinate authority with it. She forgets the ten passages (Mt 15:2, 3, 6; Mr 7:3, 5, 8, 9, 13; Ga 1:14; Col 2:8) stigmatizing man's uninspired traditions. Not even the apostles' sayings were all inspired (for example, Peter's dissimulation, Ga 2:11-14), but only when they claimed to be so, as in their words afterwards embodied in their canonical writings. Oral inspiration was necessary in their case, until the canon of the written Word should be complete; they proved their possession of inspiration by miracles wrought in support of the new revelation, which revelation, moreover, accorded with the existing Old Testament revelation; an additional test needed besides miracles (compare De 13:1-6; Ac 17:11). When the canon was complete, the infallibility of the living men was transferred to the written Word, now the sole unerring guide, interpreted by the Holy Spirit. Little else has come down to us by the most ancient and universal tradition save this, the all-sufficiency of Scripture for salvation. Therefore, by tradition, we are constrained to cast off all tradition not contained in, or not provable by, Scripture. The Fathers are valuable witnesses to historical facts, which give force to the intimations of Scripture: such as the Christian Lord's day, the baptism of infants, and the genuineness of the canon of Scripture. Tradition (in the sense of human testimony) cannot establish a doctrine, but can authenticate a fact, such as the facts just mentioned. Inspired tradition, in Paul's sense, is not a supplementary oral tradition completing our written Word, but it is identical with the written Word now complete; then the latter not being complete, the tradition was necessarily in part oral, in part written, and continued so until, the latter being complete before the death of St. John, the last apostle, the former was no longer needed. Scripture is, according to Paul, the complete and sufficient rule in all that appertains to making "the man of God perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works" (2Ti 3:16, 17). It is by leaving Paul's God-inspired tradition for human traditions that Rome has become the forerunner and parent of the Antichrist. It is striking that, from this very chapter denouncing Antichrist, she should draw an argument for her "traditions" by which she fosters anti-Christianity. Because the apostles' oral word was as trustworthy as their written word, it by no means follows that the oral word of those not apostles is as trustworthy as the written word of those who were apostles or inspired evangelists. No tradition of the apostles except their written word can be proved genuine on satisfactory evidence. We are no more bound to accept implicitly the Fathers' interpretations of Scripture, because we accept the Scripture canon on their testimony, than we are bound to accept the Jews' interpretation of the Old Testament, because we accept the Old Testament canon on their testimony.<p>our epistle&#8212;as distinguished from a "letter AS from us," 2Th 2:2, namely, that purports to be from us, but is not.

And that the papists should hence infer that there are matters of necessary consequence in religion, not contained in the Scriptures, is without ground. These they call traditions, some whereof are concerning faith, others concerning manners, others ritual, with respect to the worship of God, or the external polity of the church. But who can assure us what these are? What a door is here opened to introduce what men please into the church, under pretence of tradition! Who were the persons the apostle intrusted to keep these traditions? Why should he not declare the whole system of gospel truths he had received from Christ in writing, as well as part? Why should he conceal some things, when he wrote others?

In the doctrine of the Gospel in general, and in the article of Christ's second coming in particular, and not in the least waver about the thing itself, nor be shaken in mind, and troubled as if it was just at hand; and the rather it became them to be concerned that they stood fast in the truth, and persevered unto the end, since there was to be a falling away, and the mystery of iniquity was already working, and antichrist would shortly appear, whose coming would be with all deceivableness, of unrighteousness; and they had the greater encouragement to continue firm and unmoved, seeing they were chosen from eternity unto salvation through sanctification and belief of the truth, and were called in time by the Gospel to the enjoyment of the glory of Christ in another world. <p>And hold the traditions which ye have been taught: meaning the truths of the Gospel, which may be called traditions, because they are delivered from one to another; the Gospel was first delivered by God the Father to Jesus Christ, as Mediator, and by him to his apostles, and by them to the churches of Christ; whence it is called the form of doctrine delivered to them, and the faith once delivered to the saints: and also the ordinances of the Gospel which the apostles received from Christ, and as they received them faithfully delivered them, such as baptism and the Lord's supper; as well as rules of conduct and behaviour, both in the church, and in the world, even all the commandments of Christ, which he ordered his apostles to teach, and which they gave by him; see <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>. And so the Syriac version here renders it, "the commandments": and these were such as these saints had been taught by the apostles, under the direction of Christ, and through the guidance of his Spirit; and were not the traditions of men or the rudiments of the world, but what they had received from Christ, through the hands of the apostles: <p>whether by word, or our epistle, that is, by "our" word, as well as by our epistle, and so the Arabic version reads; these doctrines, ordinances, and rules of discipline were communicated to them, both by word of mouth, when the apostles were in person among them, and by writing afterwards to them; for what the apostles delivered in the ministry of the word to the churches, they sent them in writing, that they might be a standing rule of faith and practice; so that this does not in the least countenance the unwritten traditions of the Papists; and since these were what were taught them, "viva voce", and they received them from the mouth of the apostles, or by letters from them, or both, it became them to hold and retain them fast, and not let them go, either with respect to doctrine or practice. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</span><p>(11) The conclusion: it remains then that we continue in the doctrine which was delivered to us by the mouth and writings of the apostles, through the free good will of God, who comforts us with an invincible hope, and that we also continue in all godliness our whole life long.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄρα οὖν</span>] <span class="ital">wherefore then</span>, as such an end awaits you.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">στήκετε</span>] <span class="ital">stand fast</span>, comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a>.
