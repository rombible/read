The pronoun is somewhat emphatic. It might have seemed more natural to have sharpened the contrast between the Thessalonian Christians and the unhappy people just mentioned by beginning “But you.” It is, however, part of St. Paul’s delicacy of sympathy to describe rather the effect upon himself and his two companions of <span class= "ital">observing</span> that contrast. He sets himself to work the contrast out.<p><span class= "bld">Beloved of the Lord.</span>—Precisely the same phrase as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1Thessalonians 1:4</a>, except for the substitution of “the Lord” for “God,” which shows the concurrence of the Eternal Son in His Father’s predestinations. As in the former passage, the tense (“who have been loved”) makes the reader think of the everlasting duration of that love (<a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm" title="The LORD has appeared of old to me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you.">Jeremiah 31:3</a>), and is again connected with the mystery of election.<p>“O love, who ere life’s earliest dawn<p>On me thy choice hast gently laid.”<p><span class= "bld">Hath . . . chosen.</span>—The Greek tense should be rendered by <span class= "ital">chose, </span>referring to the definite moment (so to speak) in the divine counsels when the choice was fixed. This moment is defined as “from the beginning,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the eternity preceding the origin of time, called by the same name in <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>, <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, and <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>. It does not simply mean “from the outset,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the moment of first thinking at all about you. The identical phrase is said not to occur again in St. Paul. It may be noticed that there is a striking various-reading in some of the MSS., involving the change of only one letter, which would give us (instead of “chose you from the beginning”) “chose you as firstfruits.” Comp. <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>; but the reading in the text is better supported.<p><span class= "bld">To salvation.</span>—This “salvation” is in contrast with the “destruction” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2Thessalonians 1:9</a>), “perdition” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>), or “perishing” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2Thessalonians 2:10</a>), all of which represent the same word in the Greek. Out of the wreck of a world, God had from eternity chosen these Thessalonians to come off safely.<p><span class= "bld">Through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</span>—This again teaches us the apostolic idea of election. It is not an absolute irreversible predestination to a particular state of happiness on which the elect is to enter after death. The “salvation” is present, begun in this life (<a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>), and carried on along fixed lines, namely, “in sanctification of spirit and belief of truth” (such is the literal rendering). The preposition “in” has here the same force as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1Thessalonians 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1Thessalonians 4:7</a>, namely, <span class= "ital">“</span>by way of,” “by a course of.” If, therefore, God chose the Thessalonian Christians to salvation by a course of sanctification and belief, one thing, at any rate, is clear: that if any of them should leave that course, and fall into the errors and sins denounced in the foregoing verses, then, in the Apostle’s mind, they would have forfeited their salvation, in spite of God’s choice of them. Consequently, we are forced to one of two theories: either that the man has no free will at all, the moral character of his actions depending as entirely upon God as his final destiny; or else, that the man is free, and that God singles him out to enjoy special opportunities of sanctification and of correct belief, which the man may accept or reject as he pleases. The first of these theories lies open to the question, why, if God is responsible for the moral character of the actions of His elect and for their belief, He does not sanctify them at once and completely, and make each one infallible in doctrine; but, in any case, lax morality or creed is as incompatible with the hope of a Calvinist as with that of an orthodox Christian. “Sanctification of spirit” seems to mean “spiritual sanctification:” an inward process, not merely outward change of conduct. This is, of course, wrought by the action of the Holy Spirit upon our spirits; but the omission of the definite article in the Greek is difficult to explain if the “spirit” mentioned be other than the spirit acted upon. “Belief of truth” is opposed to “believing the lie,” of <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2Thessalonians 2:11</a> : acceptation of facts as they are, especially the deep facts of revelation, is always the great means of sanctification in Holy Scripture (<a href="/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:...">2 Thessalonians 2:13-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">But, </span>&c. — Here he proceeds to comfort them against the terrors of the preceding prophecy; <span class="ital">we are bound to give thanks always for you </span>— As if he had said, I do not mean that ye believers at Thessalonica will be concerned either in this revolt against God, or in the punishment thereof; <span class="ital">brethren, beloved of the Lord </span>— Brethren in Christ through your believing in him, and therefore peculiarly beloved of God; <span class="ital">because God hath from the beginning </span>— Of your hearing and obeying the gospel; <span class="ital">chosen you to salvation </span>— Hath pardoned, accepted, and made you his chosen people and dear children, as he hath all who, hearkening to the call of his word, truly turn to him in repentance, faith, and new obedience; <span class="ital">through sanctification of the Spirit </span>— Through that renovation of mind and heart, and reformation of life, which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit’s influences; <span class="ital">and belief of the truth </span>— By the instrumentality of which the Spirit works that important change in mankind. <span class="ital">Whereunto </span>— To which belief of the truth, and sanctification of the Spirit, or to which faith and holiness; <span class="ital">he called you by our gospel </span>— And inclined and enabled you to obey the call; <span class="ital">to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ </span>— The glory which he hath, 1st, Purchased, <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>; Ephesians 2 d, Promised, <a href="/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a>; John 3 d, Prayed for, <a href="/john/17-14.htm" title="I have given them your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.">John 17:14</a>; John 4 th, Prepared, and will bestow, <a href="/context/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

The preservation of the saints, is because God loved them with an everlasting love, from the beginning of the world. The end and the means must not be separated. Faith and holiness must be joined together as well as holiness and happiness. The outward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered effectual by the inward working of the Spirit. The belief of the truth brings the sinner to rely on Christ, and so to love and obey him; it is sealed by the Holy Spirit upon his heart. We have no certain proof of any thing having been delivered by the apostles, more than what we find contained in the Holy Scriptures. Let us then stand fast in the doctrines taught by the apostles, and reject all additions, and vain traditions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you; - see the notes on <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>. "Because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation." The following important things are affirmed or implied here:<p>(1) That God had chosen or elected them (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  heileto) to salvation. The doctrine of election, therefore, is true.<p>(2) that this was from "the beginning" &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  ap' arche&#772;s; that is, from eternity; see the <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a> note; <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9-11</a> notes. The doctrine of eternal election is, therefore, true.<p>(3) that this was the choice of the persons to whom Paul referred. The doctrine of personal election is, therefore, true.<p>(4) that this is a reason for thanksgiving. Why should it not be? Can there be any higher ground of praise or gratitude than that God has chosen us to be eternally holy and happy, and that he has from eternity designed that we should be so? Whatever, therefore, may be the feelings with which those who are not chosen to salvation, regard this doctrine, it is clear that those who have evidence that they are chosen should make it a subject of grateful praise. They can have no more exalted source of gratitude than that they are chosen to eternal life.<p>Through sanctification of the Spirit - Being made holy by the Divine Spirit. It is not without respect to character, but it is a choice to holiness and then to salvation. No one can have evidence that he is chosen to salvation except as he has evidence that he is sanctified by the Spirit; see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>.<p>And belief of the truth - In connection with believing the truth.

Some of the oldest manuscripts read as English Version, but other oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "as first-fruits." The Thessalonians were among the first converts in Europe (compare Ro 16:5; 1Co 16:15).

And this he mentions for comfort to them, and with thanksgivings to God. He had often before given thanks for them, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a> 2:13 3:9</span>; and in <span class="bld"><a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a></span>; and both here and there mentions it as a debt he was bound unto, or a duty he owed, we ought to give thanks, as in the Greek. And here he styles them, not only <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">brethren, </span> as often before, but <span class="bld">beloved of the Lord, </span> such as have been and are beloved; and therefore not in the number of them that should be damned, mentioned in the former verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation:</span> which words are either to give the reason of the apostle’s thanksgivings, or rather all arguments to evidence they were beloved of the Lord.

Though <span class="ital">beginning</span> seems to relate to time, yet the Scriptures often express eternity by such words as relate to time: as when God is called <span class="ital">the Ancient of days, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a></span>, it signifies his eternity; and Jude speaks of some that were of old ordained to condemnation, <span class="bld"><a href="/judges/1-4.htm" title="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Judges 1:4</a></span>, palai progegrammenoi, God’s eternal decrees being compared to a book wherein names are written. When was their ordaining but from eternity? And it is election to salvation, complete salvation, which is here meant, in the full fruition of it; not in the title to it by faith, or the first-fruits of it in sanctification, because they are here mentioned as the means that tend to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Through sanctification of the Spirit:</span> election is to the means as well as the end, as <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a></span>.

And the apostle joins sanctification and faith together, for they are not and cannot be put asunder. Now by all this the apostle proves they were beloved of the Lord. He saw the fruits of election in their sanctification and belief of the truth, thence concludes they were elected, and therefore loved. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you,.... Lest the saints should be discouraged by the above account of antichrist, and his followers, and fear they should be left to the same deceptions, and damnation be their portion; the apostle being persuaded better things of them, gives their character, and represents their case in a quite different light; and signifies, that he and his fellow ministers were under obligation to be continually thankful to God for what he had done for them; for as God is the Father of mercies, whether spiritual or temporal, thanks are to be given to him; and saints are not only to bless his name for what they themselves receive from him, but for what others enjoy also, and that continually; because spiritual blessings, especially such as are afterwards instanced in, are permanent and durable, yea, everlasting: the characters which show them to be different from the followers of antichrist, are <p>brethren, beloved of the Lord or "of God", as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read: they were the brethren of Christ, being the dear children of God, born of him, and belonging to his family, and of the apostles, and of one another, being of the household of faith; and they were beloved by God the Father, as the instances of their election to salvation by him, and their calling to eternal glory, show; and by the Lord Jesus Christ, who had wrought out for them the salvation they were chosen to; and by the Lord the Spirit, by whom they were regenerated, called, sanctified, and brought to the belief of the truth; and since they had interest in the everlasting love of the three divine Persons, there was no danger of their falling away and perishing. The reason of the apostle's thanksgiving for the persons thus described is, <p>because God hath from, the beginning chosen you to salvation; which is to be understood, not of an election of them, as a nation, for they were not a nation, only a part of one; nor of them as a church, for they were not so from the beginning; nor to the outward means of grace, the ministry of the word and ordinances, for the choice is unto salvation; nor to any office, for they were not all officers in the church, only some; nor does it intend the effectual calling, for that is distinguished from it in the following verse; but an eternal appointment of persons to grace and glory: and this is an act of God the Father, in Christ, from eternity; and which arises from his sovereign good will and pleasure, and is an instance of his free grace and favour, for the glorifying of himself; and is irrespective of the faith, holiness, and good works of men; all which are the fruits and effects, and not the motives, conditions, or causes of electing grace. This act is the leading one to all other blessings of grace, as justification, adoption, calling, and glorification, and is certain and immutable in itself, and in its effects. The date of it is "from the beginning": not from the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel to them, and the sense be, that, as soon as the Gospel was preached, they believed, and God chose them; for what was there remarkable in them, that this should be peculiarly observed of them? The Bereans are said to be more noble than they were: nor from the beginning of their calling, for predestination or election precedes calling; see <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a> nor from the beginning of time, or of the creation of the world, but before the world began, even from eternity; and in such sense the phrase is used in <a href="/proverbs/8-23.htm">Proverbs 8:23</a> and that it is the sense of it here, is manifest from <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a> where this choice is said to be before the foundation of the world. The end to which men, by this act, are chosen, is "salvation": not temporal, though the elect of God are appointed to many temporal salvations and deliverances, and which they enjoy both before and after conversion; yet salvation here designs the salvation of the soul, though not exclusive of the body, a spiritual and an eternal salvation, salvation by Jesus Christ, as is expressed in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a> and the same decree that appoints men to salvation, appoints Christ to be the Saviour of them; and there is salvation in and by no other. The means through which this choice is made, are <p>through sanctification of the spirit, and belief of the truth by sanctification is meant, not anything external, as reformation of life, obedience to the law, or outward submission to Gospel ordinances; but internal holiness, which lies in a principle of spiritual life in the soul, and in a principle of spiritual light on the understanding; in a flexion of the will to the will of God, and the way of salvation by Christ; in a settlement of the affections on divine and spiritual things, and in an implantation of all grace in the heart; and is called the sanctification of "the spirit", partly from the spirit or soul of man being the principal seat of it, and chiefly from the Spirit of God being the author of it; and this being a means fixed in the decree of election to salvation, shows that holiness is not the cause of election, yet is certain by it, and is necessary to salvation; and that the doctrine of election is no licentious doctrine, since it provides for and secures true and real holiness. "Truth" designs either the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the truth of types and promises, and the substance of the truth of the Gospel, in whom it lies, and by whom it comes; or the Gospel itself, which comes from the God of truth, lies in the Scriptures of truth, is dictated and directed into by the spirit of truth; the sum of it is Christ the truth, and has nothing in it but truth. The "belief" or "faith" of this intends, not an historical faith, or a mere assent to truth; but a cordial embracing of it, a receiving of the love of the truth, a feeling of the power of it unto salvation, and a believing in Christ, the substance of it; which is a seeing of him spiritually, and a going out of the soul to him in acts of hope; reliance, trust, and dependence; and this being also a means settled in the choice of men to salvation, makes it appear, that faith is no cause of election, but the effect of it; that it is necessary to salvation, and therefore appointed as a means; that it is certain to the elect by it, and that they therefore cannot be finally and totally deceived, or be carried away with the error of the wicked, or with the deceivableness of unrighteousness with which antichrist works. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> sanctification of the Spirit and <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> belief of the truth:</span><p>(10) The elect will stand steadfast and safe from all these mischiefs.

Accordingly it is also evident wherefore the apostle mentions <span class="ital">the belief in the Christian truth</span> only after <span class="greekheb">ἁγιασμός</span>, although otherwise the sanctification of man follows only on his reception of the divine word.

How safe and high above fear are “God’s elect” (<a href="/context/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies....">Romans 8:33-39</a>)!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“From the beginning” points to the time when the Gospel first visited the Thessalonians; so the “election” of <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a> is associated with the “coming of our gospel to you” (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>). Then it was that, practically and in human view, God chose this people—i.e. <span class="ital">selected them for His own out of the world</span> in which they moved. In later Epistles this “beginning” is traced back, on its Divine side, to “the foundation of the world” (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>, &c.), and shown to be a part of that which was absolutely “from the beginning” (comp. <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a>). There is an absolute beginning of salvation, hidden in the nature and eternal counsels of God; this is its relative, historical and manifest beginning (comp. <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Php 4:15</a>; <a href="/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And this choice is “unto salvation,” in the utmost sense of the word, extended in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a> to “the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ;” comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a> (see note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This salvation rests on God’s election; at the same time it has its <span class="ital">human conditions</span>: <span class="bld">salvation</span> (experienced) <span class="bld">in sanctification of spirit and faith in the truth</span>. God chooses none to salvation apart from these qualifications; the end implies the way. It is believing and sanctified men who wear “for a helmet the hope of salvation” (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>). Comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1 Peter 1:2</a> : “Elect … in sanctification of spirit” (<span class="ital">or</span> the Spirit).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Chosen <span class="ital">unto salvation</span>” stands in contrast with “son <span class="ital">of perdition</span>” and “the <span class="ital">perishing</span>” (<span class="ital"><a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2 Thessalonians 2:10</a></span>); “sanctification of spirit” and “belief in truth” on the part of God’s elect, with the “pleasure in unrighteousness” and “belief in the lie” that mark the dupes of Antichrist. These are the moral preconditions of final salvation and perdition respectively.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul writes <span class="bld">sanctification of spirit</span>, without the definite article. No doubt “spirit” may grammatically denote “the (Holy) Spirit,” but the Apostle can scarcely have so intended here. For (1) the intimate connection of this phrase with “belief of truth” inclines us to read the two (Greek) genitives alike—“truth” being the <span class="ital">object</span> of “faith,” and “spirit” of “sanctification.” (2) “Your spirit” is the primary object of the sanctification prayed for in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>. That memorable prayer is probably in the mind both of writer and readers. (3) “Sanctification of spirit,” understood as an inward state of the Thessalonians, is a condition of “salvation” the opposite of the disposition described in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved....">2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</a></span> as marking “those who perish” at the coming of Antichrist. For this reason sanctification is put first; but it depends in turn upon <span class="ital">faith</span>,—“belief in the truth.” See <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>. The normal order therefore is that of <a href="/1_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.">1 Timothy 2:15</a>, “in faith and sanctification.”—For <span class="ital">sanctification</span>, see note to <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lit., <span class="bld">belief of truth</span>. The Apostle is not stating <span class="ital">what</span> the truth is that saves, but <span class="ital">that it is truth</span> which saves, and faith in it as <span class="ital">truth</span>. A truth-accepting faith is the root of salvation, while the disposition to “believe the lie” is the root of perdition (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,...">2 Thessalonians 2:9-12</a></span>). “Sanctify them <span class="ital">in the truth</span>,” prayed Jesus for His disciples; “Thy word is truth” (<a href="/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>). The trustful acceptance of the truth revealed by Christ brings with it the consecration of our spirit to God. In such faith and consecration our salvation lies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Section IV. Words of Comfort and Prayer<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a> to <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.">2 Thessalonians 3:5</a>Passing from the last Section, we breathe a sigh of relief, and gladly join in thanksgiving for those who will “prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man” (<a href="/luke/21-36.htm" title="Watch you therefore, and pray always, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.">Luke 21:36</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Under the solemn feelings awakened by his contemplation of the image of Antichrist, the Apostle turns to his readers, blending thanksgiving with exhortation and renewed prayer on their account.
