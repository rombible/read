It must not, however, be forgotten for a moment that God did not begin to will the sinner’s judgment till after He had offered him freely the love of His own blessed truth, and had been rejected. When once the sinner is incurable, the only way to vindicate truth and righteousness is by hastening on his condemnation, whatever that condemnation may mean.<p><span class= "bld">Who believed not the truth. . . .</span>—Once more the offence for which they are condemned is insisted upon.

It is supposed to be the power of the Roman empire, which the apostle did not mention more plainly at that time. Corruption of doctrine and worship came in by degrees, and the usurping of power was gradual; thus the mystery of iniquity prevailed. Superstition and idolatry were advanced by pretended devotion, and bigotry and persecution were promoted by pretended zeal for God and his glory. This mystery of iniquity was even then begun; while the apostles were yet living, persons pretended zeal for Christ, but really opposed him. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared. The pure word of God, with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of iniquity, and in due time it shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are pretended; but they are false signs to support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles, to cheat the people; and the diabolical deceits with which the antichristian state has been supported, are notorious. The persons are described, who are his willing subjects. Their sin is this; They did not love the truth, and therefore did not believe it; and they were pleased with false notions. God leaves them to themselves, then sin will follow of course, and spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments hereafter. These prophecies have, in a great measure, come to pass, and confirm the truth of the Scriptures. This passage exactly agrees with the system of popery, as it prevails in the Romish church, and under the Romish popes. But though the son of perdition has been revealed, though he has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; and has spoken and acted as if he were a god upon earth, and has proclaimed his insolent pride, and supported his delusions, by lying miracles and all kinds of frauds; still the Lord has not yet fully destroyed him with the brightness of his coming; that and other prophecies remain to be fulfilled before the end shall come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That they all might be damned - The word "damned" we commonly apply now exclusively to future punishment, and it has a harsher signification than the original word; compare the notes, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-29.htm">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>.

The word "judged" or "condemned," would, in this place, express all that the Greek word necessarily conveys. Yet there can be no doubt that the judgment or condemnation which is referred to, is that which will occur when the Saviour will appear. It does not seem to me to be a necessary interpretation of this to suppose that it teaches that God would send a strong delusion that they should believe a lie, in order that all might be damned who did not believe the truth; or that he desired that they should be damned, and sent this as the means of securing it; but the sense is, that this course of events would be allowed to occur, "so that" &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  hina - not &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;  eis to all who do not love the truth would be condemned.<p>The particle here used, and rendered "that" (&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  hina), in connection with the phrase "all might be damned" is employed in two general senses, either as marking the end, purpose, or cause for, or on account of, which anything is done; to the end that, or in order that it may be so and so; or as marking simply the result, event, or upshot of an action, so that, so as that. Robinson, Lexicon. In the latter case it denotes merely that something will really take place, without indicating that such was the design of the agent, or that what brought it about was in order that it might take place. It is also used, in the later Greek, so as neither to mark the purpose, nor to indicate that the event would occur, but merely to point out that to which the preceding words refer. It is not proper, therefore, to infer that this passage teaches that all these things would be brought about in the arrangements of Providence, in order that they might be damned who came under their influence. The passage teaches that such would be the result; that the connection between these delusions and the condemnation of those who were deluded, would be certain. It cannot be proved from the Scriptures that God sends on men strong delusions, in order that they may be damned. No such construction should be put on a passage of Scripture if it can be avoided, and it cannot be shown that it is necessary here.<p>Who believed not the truth The grounds or reasons why they would be damned are now stated. One would be that they did not believe the truth - not that God sent upon them delusion in order that they might be damned. That people will be condemned for not believing the truth, and that it will be right thus to condemn them, is everywhere the doctrine of the Scriptures, and is equally the doctrine of common sense; see the notes on <a href="/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>.<p>But had pleasure in unrighteousness - This is the second ground or reason of their condemnation. If men have pleasure in sin, it is proper that they should be punished. There can be no more just ground of condemnation than that a man loves to do wrong. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. they all &#8230; damned&#8212;rather as Greek, "that all," &c.

It is true a man may be judged and not condemned, but the judgment of the wicked is condemnation; and damnation is here mentioned either as the event, or the effect of their believing lies, or as the purpose of God in sending them strong delusions. They are first justly punished with spiritual judgment, and then eternal, and God is just in both; whence we see that there are some errors in judgment which are damnable.

But why not rather to the doctrines of the man of sin, which he had been before speaking of?

So that we see here an erroneous mind and a vicious life going together. And when sin is come to this height, that men take pleasure in it, it makes them ripe for damnation.

A chief distinction in the interpretations consists in this, that this Pauline prediction may be considered <span class="ital">either</span> as that which will be fulfilled in the near or more distant <span class="ital">future, or</span> as having <span class="ital">already received</span> its fulfilment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I. The <span class="ital">Church Fathers</span> belong to the representatives of the first view (Irenaeus, <span class="ital">adv. haer.</span> v. 25, 29, 30; Tertullian, <span class="ital">de resur. carn.</span> c. 24; Chrysostom <span class="ital">in loco</span>; Cyril. Hierosolym. <span class="ital">Catech.</span> 15; Augustine, <span class="ital">de civit. dei</span>, xx. 19; Theodoret <span class="ital">in loco</span>, and <span class="ital">epit. decret. div.</span> c. 23; Theodorus Mopsuestius, and others). They correctly agree in considering that by the advent (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>), or the day of the Lord (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>), is to be understood the <span class="ital">personal</span> advent of Christ <span class="ital">for the last judgment and for the completion of the Messianic kingdom</span>. Also it is correctly regarded as proved, that the Antichrist here described is to be considered as an <span class="ital">individual person</span>, in whom sin will embody itself. Yet Augustin already remarks, that “nonnulli non ipsum principem, sed universum quodam modo corpus ejus i. e. ad eum pertinentem hominum multitudinem simul cum ipso suo principe hoc loco intelligi Antichristum volunt.” The restraining power by which the appearance of Antichrist is delayed, is usually considered to be the continuance of the Roman Empire (<span class="greekheb">τὸ κατέχον</span>) and its representative the Roman emperor (<span class="greekheb">ὁ κατέχων</span>). Some, however, as Theodorus Mopsuestius and Theodoret, understand by it <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸν ὅρον</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> more exactly, the counsel of God to keep back the appearance of Antichrist <span class="ital">until</span> the gospel is proclaimed throughout the earth. This latter interpretation is certainly unsuitable enough. For although the difference of gender <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατέχον</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ κατέχων</span> may be to distinguish God’s <span class="ital">counsel</span> and <span class="ital">God Himself</span>, yet <span class="greekheb">ἐκ μέσου γίνεσθαι</span> is not reconcilable with the masculine <span class="greekheb">ὁ κατέχων</span>. Chrysostom chooses a third interpretation, that by the restraining power is meant the continuance of the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. But he directly refutes this by the fact that if so, Antichrist must have already appeared, as those gifts have long since disappeared in the Christian church. The temple of God, in which Antichrist will place himself, is referred either to the Christian church (so Chrysostom, Theodoret, Augustin), the expression being taken figuratively, or to the actual temple of Jerusalem (so Irenaeus and Cyril); in which latter case the objection, that this temple was already destroyed, is met by the shift that a new temple rebuilt in place of the old one by Antichrist is to be thought on. Lastly, some, as Chrysostom,[52]—although in contradiction to the chronology of the Epistle,—interpret the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ Τῆς ἈΝΟΜΊΑς</span></span></span>, which already begins to work, of Nero, the forerunner and type of Antichrist in St. Paul’s time; and others, as Theodoret, of the outbreak of heresies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[52] <span class="greekheb">Νέρωνα ἐνταῦθά φησιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡσανεὶ τύπον ὄντα τοῦ Ἀντιχρίστου</span>· <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ οὗτος ἐβούλετο νομίζεσθαι Θεός</span>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ καλῶς εἶπε τὸ μυστήριον</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ φανερῶς ὡς ἐκεῖνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἀπηρυθριασμένως</span>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ γὰρ πρὸ τοῦ χρόνου ἐκείνου ἀνευρέθη</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησίν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὃς οὐ πολύ τοῦ Ἀντιχρίστου ἐλείπετο κατὰ τὴν κακίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τί θαυμαστόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἤδη ἔσται</span>;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The common and grave error in the explanations of the Fathers, by means of which they run counter to the Pauline representation, consisted in their not doing sufficient justice to the point of <span class="ital">nearness</span> of the event predicted by Paul. It is incontestable, as the result of correct exegesis, that Paul not only considered Antichrist as directly preceding the advent, but also regarded the advent as so near, that he himself might then be alive. It was natural that the Fathers, as the prophecy of the apostle had not been fulfilled in their times, should disregard this point; but they held that in this prophecy a picture of the last things, fully corresponding to the reality in the future, must have been given. They therefore satisfied themselves with the consideration that the prediction had already <span class="ital">begun</span> to be fulfilled in the apostolic times, but that the apostle could not possibly give an exact statement of time, as he only says that Antichrist will be revealed in <span class="ital">his appointed</span> time.[53]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[53] Comp.

It was necessary, however, partially to change and transform it, the relation of Christianity to the Roman state having altered, as the Christian church, instead of being exposed to renewed hostilities from the secular power, had obtained the sovereignty of the state, and, penetrating larger portions of the world, represented itself as the kingdom of God on earth, and an imposing hierarchy was placed at its head. Whilst, accordingly, the idea of the advent stepped more and more into the background in the church generally, and especially with the hierarchy, on the other hand, those who had placed themselves in opposition to the hierarchy believed themselves obliged to apply to <span class="ital">it</span> the description of the apostle, as well as the figures in the Apocalypse of St. John. Thus arose—whilst the early view concerning the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία τοῦ κυρίου</span> was held with only the modification that its entrance was to be expected in the <span class="ital">distant</span> future—the view, first in the eleventh century, that <span class="ital">the establishment and growing power of the Papacy</span> is to be considered as the Antichrist predicted by Paul. At first this view was expressed in the conflict between the emperors and the popes by the partisans of the imperial power; but was then repeated by all those who had placed themselves in opposition with the hierarchy, because they wished, instead of the rigid ecclesiastical power, a freer spirit of Christianity to rule; thus by the Waldenses, the Albigenses, and the followers of Wickliffe and Huss. The empire—which was regarded as nothing else than a revival and renewal of the old Roman Empire—was considered as the restraining power which still delayed the destruction of the Papacy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This reference[54] of Antichrist to the papal hierarchy became specially prevalent toward <span class="ital">the time of the Reformation</span>, and after that event was almost regarded as a dogma in the <span class="ital">evangelical church</span>. It is found in Bugenhagen, Zwingli, Calvin, Victorin Strigel, Hemming, Hunnius, Lucius and Andrew Osiander, Camero, Balduin, Aretius, Er. Schmid, Beza, Quistorp, Calixt, Calovius, Newton, Wolf, Joachim Lange, Turretin, Benson, Bengel, Macknight, Zachariae, Michaelis, and others. Accordingly it is expressed in the Lutheran symbolical books; comp. <span class="ital">Articul. Smalcald.</span> II. 4 (ed. Meyer, p. 189 f.): Haec doctrina praeclare ostendit, papam esse ipsum verum Antichristum, qui supra et contra Christum sese extulit et evexit, quandoquidem Christianos non vult esse salvos sine sua potestate, quae tamen nihil est, et a deo nec ordinata nec mandata est. Hoc proprie loquendo est se efferre supra et contra deum, sicut Paulus 2 Thessalonians 2 loquitur.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">De pot. et prim. pap.</span> (p. 210): Constat autem, Romanos pontifices cum suis membris defendere impiam doctrinam et impios cultus. Ac plane notae Antichristi competunt in regnum papae et sua membra. Paulus enim ad Thessalonicenses describens Antichristum, vocat eum adversarium Christi, extollentem se super omne, quod dicitur aut colitur deus, sedentem in templo dei tanquam deum. Also Luther’s powerful treatise against the papal bull bore the title: “Adversus exsecrabilem bullam Antichristi.” It was thought that the Papacy would go on more and more developing what was anti-Christian in it, and that then the last judgment would overtake it. The <span class="greekheb">ἀποστασία</span> was the falling away from the pure gospel to the traditions of men. The singular <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ἌΝΘΡΩΠΟς Τῆς ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is to be understood collectively as a <span class="ital">series et successio hominum</span>, inasmuch as the question is concerning an <span class="ital">imperium monarchicum</span> which remains one and the same, although its temporal head may be changed. The godlessness of Antichrist, described in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>, is historically proved by the pope placing himself above all human and divine authority, the words <span class="greekheb">πάντα λεγόμενον Θεὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., in accordance to biblical usage, being referred to the princes and great men of the world, and an allusion being discovered in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΈΒΑΣΜΑ</span></span></span> to the Roman imperial title <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΕΒΑΣΤΌς</span></span></span>. The objection, that there have been pious popes, is removed by the proverb: “<span class="ital">a potiori fit denominatio.</span>” <span class="greekheb">ναὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> is referred to the Christian church, and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΊΣΑΙ</span></span></span> to the tyrannical power usurped over it. By <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΚΑΤΈΧΟΝ</span></span></span> is nearly universally understood the Roman Empire, and by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΚΑΤΈΧΩΝ</span></span></span> the Roman emperor, for which proof is deduced from history, that the papal power sprang from the ruins of the Roman Empire, whilst in reference to the continuation of the empire in Germany, it is observed that <span class="ital">praeter titulum nihil fere</span> remains. The declaration <span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον ἤδη ἐνεργεῖται τῆς ἀνομίας</span>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, is considered as justified by the fact that at least the <span class="ital">semina erroris et ambitionis</span>, which paved the way for the Papacy, were present in the time of the apostle; for which Camero appeals to Galatians 1, 2, and others to other proofs. For an enumeration of <span class="greekheb">τέρατα ψεύδους</span>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, relics, transubstantiation, purgatory, etc., afford rich material. The annihilation of Antichrist by the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ ΤΟῦ ΣΤΌΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span> of the Lord, is understood to denote the annihilation of his importance in the minds of men by the divine word of Scripture being again opened up and diffused in its purity by means of the Reformation; whilst the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΡΓΉΣΕΙ Τῇ ἘΠΙΦΑΝΕΊᾼ Τῆς ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑς ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span> denotes the final and material destruction of Antichrist by the coming of Christ to judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[54] See against this view, Koppe, <span class="ital">Excurs.</span> II. p. 120 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the presence of such polemics used against them, the Catholics are certainly not to be blamed that in retaliation they interpreted <span class="greekheb">ἀποστασία</span> as the defection from the Roman church and from the pope, and Antichrist as the heretics, especially Luther and the evangelical church. Comp. Estius, Fromond., Bern. a Piconio.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yet even before the reference of Antichrist to Popery was maintained, <span class="ital">Mohammed</span>[55] was already regarded by the divines of the Greek church (latterly by Faber Stapulensis and others) as the Antichrist predicted by Paul, and in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΣΤΑΣΊΑ</span></span></span> was seen the defection of several Oriental and Greek churches from Christianity to Mohammedanism. This interpretation at least so far exercised an influence on the evangelical church, that some of its theologians have assumed a <span class="ital">double</span> Antichrist—one Oriental, viz. Mohammed and the Turkish power, and the other Western, viz. the pope and his power. So Melancthon, Bucer, Musculus, Bullinger, Piscator, and Vorstius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] See against this view, Turretin, p. 515 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Related to this whole method of interpretation is the assumption,[56] made in our own century, that by the apostasy is to be understood the enormities of the French Revolution; by Antichrist, Napoleon; and by him that restraineth, the continuation of the German Empire—an interpretation which the extinction of the German Empire in 1806 has already condemned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] See Leutwein, <span class="ital">das Thier war und ist nicht, und wird wiederkommen aus dem Abgrunde. Eine Abhandlung für nachdenkende Leser</span>, Ludwigsb. 1825.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In recent times it has often been considered as objectionable to determine exactly the individual traits of the imagery used by Paul. Accordingly the representation of the apostle has been interpreted in a <span class="ital">general, ideal</span>, or <span class="ital">symbolical</span> sense. To this class of interpreters belongs Koppe, according to whom Paul, founding on an old national Jewish oracle, supported especially by Daniel, would describe the ungodliness preceding the last day, which already worked, but whose full outbreak was only to take place after the death of the apostle; so that Paul himself was the <span class="greekheb">κατέχων</span>.[57] Similarly Storr (<span class="ital">l.c.</span>), who understands by the <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span> “potestas aliqua, deo omnique religioni adversaria, quae penitus incognita et futuro demum tempore se proditura sit,” and by the preventing power the “copia hominum verissimo amore inflammatorum in christianam religionem.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Further, Nitzsch (<span class="ital">l.c.</span>) thinks on the power of atheism first come to have public authority, or the contempt of all religion generally. Further, the opinion of Pelt is entirely peculiar, who in His Commentary, p. 204,[58] sums up his views in the following words: “Mihi … adversarius illi <span class="ital">principium</span> esse videtur sive <span class="ital">vis spiritualis evangelio contraria</span>, quae huc usque tamen in Pontificiorum Romanorum operibus ac serie luculentissime sese prodidit, ita tamen, ut omnia etiam mala, quae in ecclesia compareant, ad eandem Antichristi <span class="greekheb">ἐνέργειαν</span> sint referenda. Ejus vero <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> i. e. summum fastigium, quod Christi reditum <span class="ital">qui nihil aliud est, nisi regni divini victoria</span>,[59] antecedet, futurum adhuc esse videtur, quum illud tempus procul etiamnum abesse putemus, ubi omnes terrae incolae in eo erunt, ut ad Christi sacra transeant. <span class="greekheb">Κατέχον</span> vero cum Theodoreto putarim esse dei voluntatem illud Satanae regnum cohibentem, ne erumpat, et, si mediae spectantur causae, apostolorum tempore maxime imperii Romani vis, et quovis aevo illa resistentia, quam malis artibus, quae religionem subvertere student, privati commodi et honoris augendorum cupiditas opponere solet.” Pelt thinks that the symptoms of the future corruption of the Christian church were already present in the apostolic age in the danger of falling away from Christian freedom into Jewish legalism, in the mingling of heathenism with Christianity, in the false gnosis and asceticism, in the worship of angels, and in the fastus a religione Christiana omnino alienus. To the same class belongs Olshausen,[60] who considers the Pauline description only as a typical representation of future events. According to him, the chief stress lies on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ ἬΔΗ ἘΝΕΡΓΕῖΤΑΙ Τῆς ἈΝΟΜΊΑς</span></span></span>. Antichrist is a union of the individuality and spiritual tendency in masses of individuals. The revolt of the Jews from the Romans, and the fearful divine punishment in the destruction of Jerusalem, Nero, Mohammed and his spiritual devastating power, the development of the Papacy in the Middle Ages, the French Revolution of 1789, with the abrogation of Christianity, and the setting up of prostitutes on altars for worship, <span class="ital">in the external world</span>, as well as the constantly spreading denial of the fundamentals of all religious truth and morality, of the doctrines of God, freedom, and immortality, and likewise the self-deification of the ego <span class="ital">in the internal world</span>,—all these phenomena are the real precursors of Antichrist; but they contain only <span class="ital">some</span> of his characteristics, not <span class="ital">all</span>; it is the union of <span class="ital">all</span> these characteristics which shall make the full Antichrist. The preventing power is to be understood of the preponderance of the Christian world in its German and Roman constituents over the earth; <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of the whole political condition of order, with which, on the one hand, there is the constant repression of all <span class="greekheb">ἀποστασία</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΟΜΊΑ</span></span></span>, and on the other hand, the continued and peaceful development of Christianity. Of this condition the Roman Empire, as the strongest and most orderly secular organization which history knows, is the natural type. Baumgarten-Crusius is also here to be named. According to him, the Pauline prediction contains no new teachings peculiar to the apostle, but only representations from the old Messianic pictures in the prophets, especially in Daniel. The apostle’s design is practical, to make the Thessalonians calmly observant, attentive to the times, prepared and strong for the future; the passage has a permanent value in this reference, and in the chief thought that the development and determination of these things can only gradually take place. The passage is indeed historical and for the near future, but Paul has no definite or personal manifestations, whether present or future, in view, at least not in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤΙΚΕΊΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>, which he describes as still entirely concealed; and it is even doubtful whether he understood by it an individual person. Only <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΚΑΤΈΧΟΝ</span></span></span> has a definite reference, but not to a person; on the contrary, the new spirit of Christianity is meant. The difference in gender, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΚΑΤΈΧΩΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΚΑΤΈΧΟΝ</span></span></span>, is used either only to correspond with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤΙΚΕΊΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>, or Paul thinks on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΙΣΤῸς ἘΝ ΑὐΤΟῖς</span></span></span>, <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>! Lastly, to the same class belong Bloomfield and Alford.[61] According to the former, the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον τῆς ἀνομίας</span> is something still continuing; the prediction of the apostle will obtain its complete fulfilment only at the end of time, when only then the preventing power—which is most probably to be understood, with Theodoret, of the council of divine Providence—will be removed. According to the latter (see <span class="ital">Proleg.</span> p. 67 ff.), we stand, though 1800 years later, with regard to the <span class="greekheb">ἀνομός</span> where the apostle stood; the day of the Lord not present, and not to arrive until the man of sin be manifested; the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ Τῆς ἈΝΟΜΊΑς</span></span></span> still working, and much advanced in his working; the preventing power not yet taken out of the way. All this points to a state in which the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΟΜΊΑ</span></span></span> is working on underground, under the surface of things, gaining an expansion and power, although still hidden and unconcentrated. It has already partially embodied itself in Popery, in Nero and every Christian persecutor, in Mohammed and Napoleon, in Mormonism, and such like. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΈΧΟΝ</span></span></span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΈΧΩΝ</span></span></span> are to be understood of the <span class="ital">fabric of human polity</span> and <span class="ital">those who rule that polity</span>, by which hitherto all outbursts of godlessness have been suppressed and hindered in their course and devastations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] To prove this view of the <span class="greekheb">κατέχων</span> by Koppe as the correct one by a closer exposition, is the object of the above-mentioned treatise of Beyer (on <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>). Also Heydenreich, Schott, and Grimm (<span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1850, Part 4, p. 790 ff.) so far agree with Koppe, that they understand the <span class="ital">neuter</span> as the multitude of the truly pious and believers (Heydenreich), or as the <span class="ital">veri religionis doctores</span> (Schott), or as the <span class="ital">apostolorum chorus</span> (Grimm). For the removal of the objection, that Paul hoped to survive the advent, and that accordingly <span class="greekheb">ἐκ μέσου γίνεσθαι</span> would be unsuitable, Schott and Grimm consider it probable that by this expression we are to think not on death, but on “alia res externa, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> captivitas dura.” Akin to this interpretation of the <span class="greekheb">κατέχων</span> is Wieseler’s view (<span class="ital">Chronologie des apost. Zeitalt.</span>, Götting. 1848, p. 272 f.), that Paul would denote with it the pious in Jerusalem, particularly the Christians, or in case <span class="greekheb">κατέχων</span> necessarily denoted an individual, the Apostle James the Just. Comp. also Böhme, <span class="ital">de spe messiana apostolica</span>, Hal. 1826, p. 30, according to whom the apostolic circle are denoted in general, and in particular the most prominent member, perhaps the Apostle James. Hofmann judges differently upon <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατέχον</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ κατέχων</span>, <span class="ital">Schriflbeweis</span>, Part 1, 2d ed. Nördling. 1857, p. 352 f., and in his <span class="ital">h. Schr. N.T.</span>, Part 1, p. 318 ff., with whom Baumgarten, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 609, Luthardt, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 159 f., and Riggenbach coincide. According to Hofmann, as throughout the whole passage <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?...">2 Thessalonians 2:5-7</a> Paul refers apparently to the visions of Daniel, he must have spoken to the Thessalonians of that which hinders the man of sin from coming sooner than his proper time with reference to these prophecies of Daniel. Therefore, in agreement with Daniel, a spiritual power is to be thought of which rules in the secular world and in the various governments in agreement with the divine will, and opposes the influences of the spirit of nations and kingdoms working contrary to the divine will. This power may be designated both as neuter and as masculine, as <span class="greekheb">κυριότης</span> and as <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span>, and the words <span class="greekheb">μόνον ὁ κατέχων ἄρτι ἕως ἐκ μἑσου γένηται</span>· <span class="greekheb">καὶ τότε ἀποκαλυφθήσεται ὁ ἄνομος</span> are sufficiently similar to those of Daniel: וַאֲנִי יוֹצֵא וְהִנֵּה שַׂר־יָוָן בָּא (<a href="/daniel/10-20.htm" title="Then said he, Know you why I come to you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, see, the prince of Grecia shall come.">Daniel 10:20</a>), in order to be recognised as a transfer of the same to those last times when the spiritual power which now preserves the earthly commonwealth in agreement with the kingdom of God entirely recedes, in order that every form of secular power may enter which will allow no more place for the church of God on earth. Still differently, Ewald, Jahrb. der bibl. Wissenschaft, Jahr. 3, Gött. 1851, p. 250 f. (comp. Sendschreiben des Ap. Paulus, Gött. 1857, p. 27): “We have here a mystery before us which in the early apostolic times only believers loved to talk over and to diffuse among themselves, so that Paul may have been unwilling to speak openly upon it. The appearance of Antichrist was expected according to <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a> (?), and Paul here describes it, only more openly and freely than it is there indicated in the prophecy of Christ; but an opinion must have been formed in the bosom of the mother church at Jerusalem why Antichrist had not as yet appeared, which was imparted only to believers. We may, however, pretty nearly guess what it was from other signs. If we reflect that, according to <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a> ff., Antichrist was not to be considered as coming until the two martyrs of the old covenant had appeared, and their destruction was the true beginning of his extreme rage; further, that instead of these two assumed martyrs, it was also, or rather originally, still more commonly supposed that only Elijah must return before Christ, and accordingly also before Antichrist. Elijah’s return is not actually denied in that passage, where this expectation is treated of in the freest manner (<a href="/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a> f., comp. <a href="/matthew/11-13.htm" title="For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.">Matthew 11:13</a> f.), so it is most probable that by that which hindereth the appearance of Antichrist the coming of Elijah is meant (Sendschr. des Ap. Paulus, p. 27: the tarrying of Elijah in heaven); and by him who hitherto hindered, and who must be taken out of the way before the last atrocious wickedness of Antichrist, is meant Eljiah himself.” Still otherwise Noack (Der Ursprung des Christenthums, vol. II., Leipz. 1857, p. 313 ff.), who by him that hindereth—arbitrarily identifying the same with the man of sin—understands Simon Magus and his machinations. Still differently Jowett, according to whom (after the suggestion of Ewald, Jahrb. X., Gött. 1860, p. 235) <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατέχον</span> is designed to indicate the Mosaic law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] In only an unessentially modified form Pelt has latterly maintained the same view in the <span class="ital">Theolog. Mitarbeiten. Jahrg.</span> 4, Kiel 1841, H. 2, p. 114 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[59] Comp. Pelt, p. 185: … “tenentes, illum Christi adventum a Paulo <span class="ital">non visibilem</span> habitum.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[60] Bisping follows him in all essential points.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[61] Comp. also Düsterdieck, <span class="ital">die drei johanneischen Briefe</span>, Bd. I., Gött. 1852, p. 306: “John, as Paul (<a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,...">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>), in conformity to the instruction of the Lord, recognises in the powerful errors of the present the signs of an approaching decision. The last hour is present, the advent is at hand. The last hour is the concluding period of <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν οὗτος</span>, <span class="ital">the period of travail, which continues in an unbroken connection from its commencement, the destruction of Jerusalem, even to the end, to which the advent directly succeeds</span>.” John has not erred in that he <span class="ital">soon</span> expected the real commencement of the crisis, continually carried on throughout the whole historical development of the kingdom of Christ; for that generation, as our Lord had predicted, survived the destruction of the holy city, an event of whose importance in the history and judgment of the world there can be no doubt. Moreover, in reference to <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), Düsterdieck (<span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 308) recognises that there Paul has shortened the chronological perspective too much; but then he thinks, referring to <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a> ff. and <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a> ff., that this is an imperfection which was gradually overcome in the apostle by the moral development of his life in God, and that it was changed for the real truth. But it is assumed, without right, that an entirely different view of things lies at the foundation of the section <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,...">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a> than of the section <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a> ff., as the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians was written only a few months after the First; and besides, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a> points to the agreement of the <span class="ital">written</span> explanations there given with the <span class="ital">oral</span> instructions to the Thessalonians given even previously to the First Epistle. Further on, Düsterdieck (p. 330) concedes that because Paul in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a> ff. has abbreviated the interval to the advent, he was also in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a> ff. constrained to represent the personal appearance of the opponent <span class="ital">incorrectly in point of chronology</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is evident that all these explanations are arbitrary. The Pauline description is so definitely and sharply marked, and has for its whole compass so much the idea of <span class="ital">nearness</span> for its supposition, that it can by no means be taken generally, and in this manner explained away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II. Others have regarded the apocalyptic instruction of the apostle as a prophecy <span class="ital">already fulfilled</span>. Thus Grotius, Wetstein, Hammond, Clericus, Whitby, Schoettgen, Noesselt, Krause, and Harduin.[62] The reference of the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία τοῦ κυρίου</span> to the coming of the Lord in judgment at the <span class="ital">destruction of Jerusalem</span>, is common to all these writers. In reference to the other chief points of the Pauline representation they differ as follows:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[62] What is necessary to be said on Kern’s view has already been observed in the Introduction, sec. 3. Döllinger (<span class="ital">l.c.</span>), who like Kern understands by Antichrist <span class="ital">Nero</span>, thinks, however, that with this assumption the authenticity of the Epistle, and even its composition in the year 53, are perfectly reconcilable. According to Döllinger, the prophecy in all its essentials was fulfilled close upon the apostle’s days, although a partial fulfilment at the end of time is not excluded by this assumption. Already Paul has recognised the <span class="ital">youthful</span> Nero as the future Antichrist, whose public appearance was already prepared, but was yet prevented by Claudius as the then possessor of the imperial throne. The coming of Christ is His coming to execute judgment on Jerusalem. Nero, although he personally undertook nothing against the temple of Jerusalem, yet entrusted Vespasian with the guidance of the war, and accordingly brought—certainly only after his death—the abomination of desolation into the holy city. Lastly, the apostasy is the being led astray into the false doctrines of the Gnostics.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Grotius[63] understands by Antichrist the Emperor <span class="ital">Caius Caligula</span>, notorious for his ungodliness, who, according to Suetonius, <span class="ital">Caligul.</span> xxii. 33, ordered universal supplication to himself as the supreme God, and according to Joseph. <span class="ital">Antiq.</span> xviii. 8, and Philo, <span class="ital">legat. ad Caj.</span> p. 1022, wished to set up his colossal statue in the temple of Jerusalem; by the <span class="greekheb">κατέχων</span>, <span class="ital">L.

Like the prophet John half a century later (<a href="/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a> f.), Paul distinguishes his anti-Christ or antitheistic hero from the Satan whose campaign he executes; but, unlike John, the apostle has nothing to say about the fate of Satan. The tools and the victims of Satan are destroyed, and they alone.—<span class="greekheb">εὐδοκ</span>. not with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> as usual, but with the less common (<span class="ital">cf. e.g.</span>, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-43.htm" title="Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.">1Ma 1:43</a>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ πολλοὶ ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ ηὐδόκησαν τῇ λατρίᾳ αὐτοῦ</span>) dative. “And the greater number of those who shall have been associated together in order to receive the Beloved he [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, Beliar] will turn aside after him” (<span class="ital">Asc.

God intends that men who are so disposed should “believe the lie,” so that their false belief may be a touchstone and demonstration of their falseness. Men without love of truth naturally believe the lie when it comes; there is nothing else for them. And this is a terrible judgement upon them. As Christ came at first “for judgement into this world” (<a href="/john/9-39.htm" title="And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.">John 9:39</a>, &c.), by His presence discriminating the lovers of truth and falsehood, so it will be with Antichrist at his coming. He will attract his like; and this attraction will be the exposure of their hatred of the truth. Comp. <a href="/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a> : “To those who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness … wrath and indignation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is not yet the Last Judgement, and it is possible that some under this retribution may yet repent, seeing how shameful is the delusion into which they have fallen by rejecting Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all</span> (probably <span class="bld">all together</span>, in the Greek) marks the universal range of this judgement; the delusion takes effect everywhere; it will be the one thing in which the enemies of Christ agree, and it furnishes a decisive test of their character. Comp. “the mark of the Wild Beast” in <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm" title="And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.">Revelation 13:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm" title="And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:">Revelation 13:16</a> : “The whole earth wondered after the beast … All that dwell on the earth shall worship him, every one whose name hath not been written in the Lamb’s book of life.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That they <span class="ital">had pleasure in unrighteousnes</span> explains the readiness of these unhappy men to accept the “deceit of <span class="ital">unrighteousness</span>” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.">2 Thessalonians 2:10</a>). They are credulous of that which falls in with their evil inclination. Wicked men are the dupes of wickedness. Comp. <a href="/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a>, where the fact that men not only do the vilest things, but “<span class="ital">take pleasure in</span> those who do them,” adds the finishing touch to the Apostle’s black picture. Such an one does wrong not through force of passion or example or habit, but out of sheer delight in wrong. “The light that is in him has become darkness.” He says with Milton’s Satan,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Farewell remorse, all good to me is lost;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Evil be thou my good!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Men of this type will welcome eagerly the reign of Antichrist.
