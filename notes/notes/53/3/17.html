The actual salutation does not begin until the benediction of the 18th verse, to which this 17th is intended to attract attention.<p><span class= "bld">Which.</span>—Namely, the autograph addition of a salutation, or valedictory prayer, not the special words in which it was couched.<p><span class= "bld">The token.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">a token</span>—a mark, that is, by which to tell an authentic Epistle of his from those forged letters with which false brethren had troubled the Thessalonian Church (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>). At first sight, it seems to us too audacious for any one to have conceived the thought of writing a letter under the name of St. Paul; but, on the other hand, we must recollect several points. (1) St. Paul’s genuine First Epistle, in spite of its claim to inspiration (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>), could not yet have acquired in the eyes of the Thessalonians the sanctity it wears for us; they had no notion of such a thing as Holy Scriptures, and even if they had, St. Paul was a familiar figure, a mechanic who had just left them, not yet invested with the heroic halo. (2) Such literary forgeries were not uncommon in that age, and scarcely considered reprehensible, unless they were framed to inculcate with authority some heretical teaching. Apocryphal Gospels soon after abounded, under false titles, and works fathered upon St. Clement and other great Church teachers. (3) There need nor always have been a direct intention to deceive the readers as to the authorship, but the renowned name acted as a tempting advertisement for the work, and the theories thus shot forth hit their mark; whether the real authorship were discovered or not mattered little in comparison. Such points must be borne in mind before we accept as genuine any of the early Christian writings.<p><span class= "bld">In every epistle.</span>—That is, naturally, “in every Epistle which I write.” It cannot be narrowly restricted to mean, “in every Epistle which I shall for the future write to you Thessalonians,” though that is, of course, the practical significance. Nor does it imply a formed design of writing other Epistles to other churches. It seems necessary to suppose that St. Paul had already made a practice of concluding Letters with his autograph, though only one Letter of his is now extant of an earlier date than our present Epistle. There is no reason whatever to suppose that all the Letters ever written by St. Paul have been preserved to us (see Dr. Lightfoot’s <span class= "ital">Philippians, </span>p. 136, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>any more than all the sayings and acts of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/21-25.htm" title="And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.">John 21:25</a>); and even when he wrote his First Epistle to Thessalonica he had seen the necessity of giving careful directions about his Letters (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm" title="I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.">1Thessalonians 5:27</a>), and of rousing his correspondents to a reasonable scepticism (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1Thessalonians 5:21</a>). The same solicitude re-appears in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-21.htm" title="The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.">1Corinthians 16:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a>. And the rule which St. Paul had already made he always observed, so far as we can test; for all his extant Epistles, as Bishop Wordsworth points out on <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-28.htm" title="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.">1Thessalonians 5:28</a>, contain his “salutation” at the end.<p><span class= "bld">So I write.</span>—“Such is my handwriting.” It need not mean that the Thessalonians hitherto were unacquainted with his hand; he only calls their attention closely to it.

And let us desire the same blessings for ourselves and our friends. Peace with God. This peace is desired for them always, or in every thing. Peace by all means; in every way; that, as they enjoyed the means of grace, they might use all methods to secure peace. We need nothing more to make us safe and happy, nor can we desire any thing better for ourselves and our friends, than to have God's gracious presence with us and them. No matter where we are, if God be with us; nor who is absent, if God be present. It is through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that we hope to have peace with God, and to enjoy the presence of God.

The Epistle was written by an amanuensis (perhaps Silas or Timothy), and only the closing salutation written by Paul's "own hand" (compare Ro 16:22; 1Co 16:21; Col 4:18).

Heretics in several ages, and the Church of Rome particularly, have herein been deeply guilty.

The handwriting of the apostle was accordingly still unknown to the readers. From this it follows, that also the First Epistle to the Thessalonians was not written by the apostle’s own hand. Moreover, Zeltner (<span class="ital">de monogrammate Pauli</span>, Altorfii 1721), Bengel, and Moldenhauer erroneously—because transferring a modern custom into antiquity—consider that we are here to think on characters <span class="ital">artificially twisted into a monogram by the apostle and rendered incapable of imitation</span>.

Conclusion. Paul now takes the pen from his amanuensis, to add the salutation in his own handwriting for the purpose of authenticating the epistle (otherwise in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-21.htm" title="The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.">1 Corinthians 16:21</a>). This, he observes, is the sign-manual of his letters (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the fact of a personal written greeting at the close, not any form of words (like <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-18.htm" title="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.">2 Thessalonians 3:18</a>), or the use of the word “grace,” or “certum quendam nexum literarium” (Grotius). The precaution is natural, in view of his suspicion about unauthorised communications. Compare “the <span class="greekheb">σεσημείωμαι</span> (generally contracted into <span class="greekheb">σεση</span>) with which so many of the Egyptian papyrus-letters and ostraca close” (Milligan, p. 130), or the postscript in one’s own handwriting (<span class="greekheb">ξύμβολον</span>) which guaranteed an ancient letter (Deissmann: <span class="ital">Licht vom Osten</span>, 105). <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm" title="Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>), the divine presence is realised through the experience of Christ’s grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">The salutation of Paul with mine own hand</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">The salutation with my own hand—of PAUL</span>. In the last word the Apostle’s formal signature is attached. Pen in hand, he adds the brief concluding sentences to the letter, lying now all but complete before him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle commonly employed one of his helpers as amanuensis. “I Tertius, who wrote this letter,” e.g., in <a href="/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; comp. <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a>, <a href="/philemon/1-19.htm" title="I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.">Philemon 1:19</a>, where he notifies his writing <span class="ital">sua manu</span>. But it was needful that he should sign his name, with a few words of greeting written by himself, in order to authenticate the Epistle. In other Epistles we find the autograph conclusion without the final signature, which was not usual in ancient letters. There is no reference of this kind at the close of his First Epistle; but since that time his written authority had been alleged for statements he had never made (ch. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). He is careful to guard against this possibility in writing to Thessalonica a second time. He calls attention, as he pens this attestation, to his handwriting, and gives notice that no document bearing his name will be genuine without this seal: <span class="bld">which is the token in every epistle</span> (“Paul’s mark,” as one might say)—<span class="bld">thus I write</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There was something peculiar and noticeable in the Apostle’s penmanship, which could not he mistaken.

The same authentication expressed in the same words is found in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-21.htm">1 Corinthians 16:21</a>), and in the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span>; referring, not to the salutation, but to the whole clause; which circumstance. <span class="cmt_word">Is the token;</span> the mark of authentication. <span class="cmt_word">Of every Epistle.</span> Such authentication was especially necessary in the case of the Thessalonians, as it would seem that a forged epistle had been circulated among them (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). Some restrict the words to the Epistles which the apostle would afterwards write to the Thessalonians (Lunemann); but they are rather to be understood of a caution which the apostle practised, or was to practise, in all his Epistles. Some refer the token to the words, "The salutation of Paul with mine own hand," and although these words are only found in two other Epistles, yet it is asserted that the  other Epistles were otherwise sufficiently authenticated. But it appears better to understand by the salutation the benediction which follows; and a similar salutation or benediction is found at the close of all Paul's Epistles (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-28.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:28</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The salutation of Paul with mine own hand (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Rev. properly, "the salutation of me Paul."
