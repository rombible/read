Such as could work, and would not, were not to be maintained in idleness. Christianity is not to countenance slothfulness, which would consume what is meant to encourage the industrious, and to support the sick and afflicted. Industry in our callings as men, is a duty required by our calling as Christians. But some expected to be maintained in idleness, and indulged a curious and conceited temper. They meddled with the concerns of others, and did much harm. It is a great error and abuse of religion, to make it a cloak for idleness or any other sin. The servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright, must be working as his Lord has commanded. If we are idle, the devil and a corrupt heart will soon find us somewhat to do. The mind of man is a busy thing; if it is not employed in doing good, it will be doing evil. It is an excellent, but rare union, to be active in our own business, yet quiet as to other people's. If any refused to labour with quietness, they were to note him with censure, and to separate from his company, yet they were to seek his good by loving admonitions. The Lords is with you while you are with him. Hold on your way, and hold on to the end. We must never give over, or tire in our work. It will be time enough to rest when we come to heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not because we have not power ... - See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.
