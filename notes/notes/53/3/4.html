St. Chrysostom’s whole comment is worth transcription:—“God, saith he, is faithful, and having promised to save, save He assuredly will, but <span class= "ital">as</span> He promised. And how did He promise? If we would be agreeable, and would hear Him; not unconditionally, nor while we remain inactive like stocks and stones. Yet, well has he added his, ‘We rely <span class= "ital">in the Lord</span>:’ that is, ‘We trust to His love of men.’ Once more he takes them down, ascribing the whole matter to that quarter; for had he said ‘We trust to you,’ it would have been a great compliment indeed, but would not have taught them to ascribe all to God; and had he said ‘We rely on the Lord that He will keep you,’ without adding ‘upon you,’ and ‘that ye both do and will do what things we command,’ he would have made them less active by casting the whole upon the power of God.” (See the passage of Galatians referred to in the margin.)<p><span class= "bld">Both do and will do.</span>—The emphasis of the sentence is on the future tense, the commendation of the present being only intended to do away the rebuke which might have been conveyed by the future alone. How careful St. Paul is not to wound susceptibilities, though he never “pleases men”! (See, for instance, Notes on <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1Thessalonians 4:9-10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1Thessalonians 5:11</a>.)

Enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, are unreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and no wonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours to oppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are other evils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to depend upon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performance is sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that was founded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is our sin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects. There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, by the special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not, we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, to obey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to the love of God, and the patience of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And we have confidence in the Lord - Not primarily in you, for you have hearts like others, but in the Lord. It is remarkable that when Paul expresses the utmost confidence in Christians that they will live and act as becomes their profession, his reliance is not on anything in themselves, but wholly on the faithfulness of God. He must be a stranger to the human heart who puts much confidence in it even in its best state; see <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>; compare Jde 1:24; <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-26.htm">Proverbs 28:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. we have confidence in the Lord&#8212;as "faithful" (2Th 3:3).

And he describes their obedience by doing what the apostle and his fellow labourers in the gospel among them commanded them, whether they were commandments about the duties of the law of the first or second tables, or the doctrine, order, worship, or discipline of the gospel; so that their commandments were no other but the commandments of the Lord himself, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

Both our faith and practice in religion are to be built upon Divine authority; either upon what God hath expressly declared, or what by clear consequence may be derived from it. So that what they command the people is from the Lord, and not themselves. Their work is to search out the mind and will of Christ, as revealed in the Scripture, seeing they have not that immediate infallible inspiration that the apostles had, who were called to lay the foundation which others were to build upon. And as to those things that are but appendices, and not of the substance of religion, and for which no particular rule is or can be laid down, Christian prudence is to regulate them according to general rules, wherein the advice, appointment, and authority of the minister is to be regarded in every church. Yet nothing ought to be enjoined in these things that is uncomely, that is not for edification, that is not of good report, that hath an appearance of evil, that gives just occasion of offence, that transgresseth the general rule of mercy, that is a direction of superstition, whereby many of the commandments of the Romish Church are justly condemned. And obedience to these commandments of the apostle he describes by the universality of it, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the things that we command you; </span> that is, all things; the indefinite being equivalent to the universal. And by the constancy of it, <span class="ital">that ye both do and will do, </span>& c.; ye will persevere to do what commandments ye have already received, or any new commandments we shall further give you; some whereof are probably such as are mentioned in the following part of this chapter. And their present obedience gave the apostle confidence about that which was future; at least he declares to them this confidence, as an insinuating argument to persuade them thereunto. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And we have confidence in the Lord touching you,....

The like satisfaction he has repeatedly expressed (ch. <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:...">1 Thessalonians 3:6-10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another....">1 Thessalonians 4:9-10</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν Κυριῳ</span>, <span class="ital">in the Lord</span>) Trust [“Have confidence in”] no man by himself.—<span class="greekheb">παραγγέλλομεν</span>, <span class="ital">we charge</span> or <span class="ital">command</span>) for example, that ye pray for us, that ye fortify yourselves.

The obedience of the Thessalonians flowed from the grace of Christ; it was in consequence of the communication of the influences of his Spirit that they were enabled to make progress and to persevere in the Christian life. "Here," observes Professor Jowett, "as elsewhere, the apostle speaks of believing, hoping, doing all things in Christ. We lead an ordinary life as well as a religious one; but, with the apostle, his ordinary life is his religious one, and hence he uses religious expressions in reference to all that he says and does."
