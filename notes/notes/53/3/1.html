now he asks them to pray for him.” How much of a Christian teacher’s power, increasing as time goes on, comes from the accumulation of intercession from his spiritual children! St. Paul leaves people praying for him everywhere (<a href="/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;">Romans 15:30</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18-19</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm" title="Brothers, pray for us.">1Thessalonians 5:25</a>; comp. <a href="/hebrews/13-18.htm" title="Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.">Hebrews 13:18</a>). In all these cases the request is for active help in his work of evangelising:” not that he may fall into no danger,” says St. Chrysostom, “for that he was appointed unto.” (Comp. <a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm" title="Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.">2Timothy 2:9</a>.) “That” stands for “in order that,” and does not introduce merely the subject of the prayer.<p><span class= "bld">May have free course.</span>—Quite literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">may run along.</span> Speed and security are contained in this idea: no hesitation about the next turn, no anxious picking of the way, and no opposition from devils and bad men. Bengel compares <a href="/psalms/147-15.htm" title="He sends forth his commandment on earth: his word runs very swiftly.">Psalm 147:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And be glorified.</span>—The word does not mean merely “obtain applause,” “win distinction,” as a successful runner; it always implies the recognition or acknowledgment of inherent admirable qualities. (See Notes on <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm" title="That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2Thessalonians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1Thessalonians 2:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Even as it is with you.</span>—Such praise would flush the Thessalonians to pray for him with greater fervour and assurance. “With you” means, in the Greek, “in your direction,” “on turning to you:” people had only to look at Thessalonica, and they were forced to recognise the character of the gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:...">2 Thessalonians 3:1-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Finally, brethren, pray for us </span>— See on <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>; <span class="ital">that the word of the Lord may have free course </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">τρεχη</span>, <span class="ital">may run, </span>go on swiftly without any interruption; <span class="ital">and be glorified </span>— Acknowledged as divine, and bring forth much fruit; <span class="ital">even as it is with you </span>— This is a very high commendation of the Thessalonian brethren, and was designed to encourage them in their attachment to the gospel. <span class="ital">And that we may be delivered </span>— Rescued and preserved; <span class="ital">from unreasonable and wicked men</span> — The word <span class="greekheb">ατοπων</span>, rendered <span class="ital">unreasonable, </span>properly signifies men who have, or ought to have, <span class="ital">no place, </span>namely, in society. Bishop Wilkins thinks that <span class="ital">absurd, contumacious </span>persons are intended; such as are not to be fixed by any principles, and whom no topics can work upon. Doubtless the apostle had in his eye chiefly, if not only, the unbelieving Jewish zealots, who were so exceedingly enraged against him for preaching salvation to the Gentiles, without requiring them to obey the law of Moses, that they followed him from place to place, and raised a furious storm of persecution against him wherever they found him, by inflaming both the rulers and the people against him; and they had lately made an insurrection at Corinth, with an intention to have him put to death. <span class="ital">For all men have not faith </span>— And all who have not are, more or less, unreasonable and wicked men. By <span class="ital">faith, </span>in this passage, it seems we are not to understand the actual belief of the gospel, (for that all men had not that faith was a fact too obvious to be thus noticed by the apostle,) but such a desire to know and do the will of God as would dispose a person to believe and obey the gospel when fairly proposed to him. And it seems, in making this observation, the apostle glances not only at the Jews, who boasted of their faith in the true God, and in the revelation of his will which he had made to them, but at the Greek philosophers likewise, who had assumed to themselves the pompous appellation of <span class="ital">lovers of wisdom, </span>or truth. <span class="ital">But the Lord is faithful </span>— And will not deceive the confidence, or disappoint the hopes of any that trust in him, and expect the accomplishment of his promises; <span class="ital">who shall stablish you </span>— Even all that cleave to him by faith and love; <span class="ital">and keep you from evil </span>— From all the mischievous devices of Satan and his instruments, <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">2 Timothy 4:18</a>. The Greek, <span class="greekheb">απο του πονηρου</span>, is literally, <span class="ital">from the evil one; </span>the name given in other passages of Scripture to the devil, <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm" title="Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:">Matthew 6:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>. <span class="ital">And we have confidence in the Lord — </span>Or we trust in the Lord concerning you, that he will not withhold from you the aids of his grace; <span class="ital">that ye both do </span>already, <span class="ital">and will do, </span>in future, <span class="ital">the things which we command </span>— In thus speaking, the apostle expresses his good opinion of the greater part of the Thessalonian brethren, but not of every one of them without exception, as is plain from <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies....">2 Thessalonians 3:11-14</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Those who are far apart still may meet together at the throne of grace; and those not able to do or receive any other kindness, may in this way do and receive real and very great kindness. Enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and persecutors of its faithful preachers, are unreasonable and wicked men. Many do not believe the gospel; and no wonder if such are restless and show malice in their endeavours to oppose it. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are other evils we need to be preserved from, and we have encouragement to depend upon the grace of God. When once the promise is made, the performance is sure and certain. The apostle had confidence in them, but that was founded upon his confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. He prays for them for spiritual blessings. It is our sin and our misery, that we place our affections upon wrong objects. There is not true love of God, without faith in Jesus Christ. If, by the special grace of God, we have that faith which multitudes have not, we should earnestly pray that we may be enabled, without reserve, to obey his commands, and that we may be enabled, without reserve, to the love of God, and the patience of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Finally, brethren, pray for us - That is, for Paul, Silas, and Timothy, then engaged in arduous labors at Corinth.

The margin is "run." So also the Greek.

The gospel would spread rapidly in the earth if all the obstructions which men have put in its way were removed; and that they may be removed should be one of the constant subjects of prayer.<p>And be glorified - Be honored; or appear to be glorious.<p>As it is with you - It is evident from this that Paul met with some obstructions in preaching the gospel where he was then laboring. What they were, he mentions in the next verse.

It imports the adding of something that remains. And that which he first addeth, is the desire of their prayers; as he had desired them in the former Epistle, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm" title="Brothers, pray for us.">1 Thessalonians 5:25</a></span>; and so of other churches, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a> <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm" title="And for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,">Ephesians 6:19</a> <a href="/hebrews/13-18.htm" title="Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.">Hebrews 13:18</a></span>, &c. He had prayed for them in the foregoing chapter, and now he begs their prayers. It is a mutual duty that ministers and people owe to one another. Though the apostle gave himself to the word, and prayer also, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/6-4.htm" title="But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.">Acts 6:4</a></span>, yet the prayers of many may be more prevalent than of one, though an apostle: and they being concerned for the advancing of Christ’s interest in the world, as they were Christians, were therefore engaged to pray for him. And the apostle was sensible of the greatness of the work which was in his hand, and his own insufficiency, without God, therefore he desires prayer; and it is of them whom he here calls <span class="ital">brethren:</span> he knew the prayers of the wicked and unbelievers would avail nothing; and though he was a great apostle, yet the greatest in the church may stand in need of, and be helped by, the prayers of the meanest brethren. And their prayers he desires are, first, with respect to his ministry, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that the word of the Lord may have free course, </span> or may run; that the course of it may not be stopped, it being as a river of the water of life. The apostle was to teach all nations, and so desires the word may pass from one nation to another, yea, and run down from one generation to another, that it may spread and diffuse itself, and disciples might be multiplied. This is called the increasing of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/6-7.htm" title="And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.">Acts 6:7</a></span>; the growing and multiplying of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/12-24.htm" title="But the word of God grew and multiplied.">Acts 12:24</a></span>; the growing and prevailing of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/19-20.htm" title="So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.">Acts 19:20</a></span>: which Christ sets forth by the parable of the mustard-seed, which grew and spread; and of the leaven, that diffused its virtue in the meal, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/13-31.htm" title="Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:...">Matthew 13:31-33</a></span>: the apostle referring here to the external course of the word, rather than its inward efficacy in the soul, as also Christ seems chiefly to do in those parables. There are many things that hinder the course of the gospel; sometimes wicked rulers make laws against it, sometimes great persecutions have been raised, sometimes false teachers oppose it, sometimes professors prove apostates and scandalize the world against it, sometimes reproaches are thrown in the way of it. And to the free course of it is required, on the contrary, a provision of suitable help herein, both of magistracy and ministry, and the bestowing of the Spirit, and the blessing of endeavours used herein. All these are to be prayed for, as the former to be prayed against. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And be glorified:</span> he means, that it might have honour, reputation, and high esteem in the world, and not lie under reproach; as the Jews accounted it heresy, and the Gentiles foolishness: as it is said of those Gentiles, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/13-48.htm" title="And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.">Acts 13:48</a></span>, they <span class="ital">glorified the word of the Lord, </span> by their honourable respect to it, and joy in it. As also that it might produce glorious effects in the world, in subduing people to God, and making men new creatures, and bringing them out of the devil’s into Christ’s kingdom, &c.; that it may evidence itself to be from heaven, and the power of God to men’s salvation, and not an invention of man; to which we may add, that it may be honoured in the unblamable and exemplary walking of the professors of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Even as it is with you:</span> the glorious success of it with them he had largely shown before in both these Epistles; and he would have them pray for the like with others. Those that have felt the power of the gospel themselves to their conversion and salvation, should pray that others may partake of it with them. Herein they show their charity to men, and love to God, which the apostle here puts them upon, as that which would be acceptable to God; and the rather, because their own experience might teach them what God was able to do for others. Or else the apostle in these words sets forth these Thessalonians as a pattern of the mighty success of the word: it had its free course and was glorified among them; they received it as the word of God, and not of men. As if the apostle should say: They that would know the glorious success of the word of the Lord, let them go to Thessalonica. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Finally, brethren, pray for us,.... The apostle now proceeds to the last and closing part of the epistle, which respects church discipline, and the removing of disorderly persons from their communion; and introduces it with a request to pray for him, and the rest of his fellow ministers, particularly Silvanus and Timothy, who joined with him in this epistle: he signifies that nothing more remained; this was the last he had to say, that they, "the brethren", not the preachers of the word only, but the members of the church, would be solicitous for them at the throne of grace; as it becomes all the churches, and the several members of them, to pray for their ministers: with respect to their private studies, that they might be directed to suitable subjects; that their understandings might be opened to understand the Scriptures; that their gifts might be increased, and they be more and more fitted for public service: and with respect to their public ministrations, that they be brought forth in the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ; that they have a door of utterance given them to preach the Gospel freely and boldly, as it ought to be spoken; and that their ministry be blessed to saints and sinners: and with respect to the world, and their conduct in it, that they be kept from the evil of it, and so behave as to give none offence, that the ministry be not blamed; and that they be not allured by the flatteries, nor intimidated by the frowns of the world, but endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ: and with respect to their persons and state, that their souls may prosper, and that they may have much of the presence of God, and much spiritual joy, peace, comfort, and strength of faith; and that they may enjoy bodily health, and their lives be spared for further usefulness. This request is frequently urged by the apostle; which shows his sense of the importance of the work of the ministry, the insufficiency of men for it, the necessity of fresh supplies of grace, and the great usefulness of prayer. The particular petitions he would have put up follow, <p>that the word of the Lord may have free course. By "the word of the Lord", or "of God", as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions read, is meant the Gospel; which is of God, and not of man, comes by the Lord Jesus Christ, and is concerning him, his person and offices, and concerning peace, pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation by him, as the subject matter of it: and the request is, that this might "have free course": or "might run": be propagated and spread far and near: the ministry of the word is a course or race, and ministers are runners in it, having their feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; which is the message they are sent with, and the errand they run upon: which comes from heaven, and is to be carried into all the world, and spread: Satan and his emissaries do all they can to hinder the progress of it; God only can remove all obstructions and impediments; when he works none can let; all mountains become a plain before Zerubbabel. Wherefore the apostle directs to pray to him for it, with what follows, <p>and be glorified, even as it is with you; the Gospel is glorified when it is attended upon by large numbers, and is heard with a becoming reverence; when it is received in the love of it, is greatly prized and highly esteemed; when it is cordially embraced, and cheerfully obeyed. It is glorified when sinners are converted by it, and the lives of the professors of it are agreeably to it; and thus it was glorified in these several instances at Thessalonica; and therefore the apostle puts them upon praying, that it might be so elsewhere, as there; even "everywhere", as the Syriac version adds. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Finally, <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have <i>free</i> course, and be glorified, even as <i>it is</i> with you:</span><p>(1) He adds now consequently according to his manner, various admonitions: the first of them is, that they pray for the increase and passage of the Gospel, and for the safety of the faithful ministers of it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ λοιπόν</span>] see on <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περὶ ἡμῶν</span>] <span class="ital">on our behalf</span>.

According to Hofmann, with whom Möller, although wavering, coincides, the words are to be united with <span class="greekheb">τρέχῃ</span>, passing over <span class="greekheb">καὶ δοξάζηται</span>.

The general aim of the passage is to widen the horizon of the Thessalonians, by enlisting their sympathy and interest on behalf of the apostles. They are not the only sufferers, or the only people who need prayer and help.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἰς Κόρινθόν ἐσθʼ ὁ πλοῦς</span>, so ran the ancient proverb. Paul writes from Corinth that while everyone has the chance, not all have the desire, to arrive at the faith. <span class="greekheb">ἡ πίστις</span> is the faith of the gospel, or Christianity. By a characteristic play upon the word, Paul (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>), hurries on to add, “but the Lord is faithful”. <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> (for which Bentley and Baljon plausibly conjecture <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>) shows how lightly his mind rests on thoughts of his own peril as compared with the need of others.
