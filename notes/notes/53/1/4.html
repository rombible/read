Possibly, because it seemed almost like self-praise to praise their own converts; but much more probably, because the writers had before felt and expressed misgivings on the point: this suits the thought of <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2Thessalonians 1:3</a> better.<p><span class= "bld">Glory in you in the churches of God.</span>—Not only in thanksgiving to God (though, perhaps, outbursts of praise in the public services of “the churches” may be included), but also in talking to other men, at Corinth and elsewhere: so, in return, St. Paul “boasted” to the Thessalonians about the Corinthians (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2Corinthians 9:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Your patience and faith.</span>—It was well proved that St. Paul had no more cause for misgiving, and that the tempter’s tempting by persecution had not made the apostolic labours to be in vain. (See <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1Thessalonians 3:5</a>.) “Patience,” in the New Testament, does not mean a meek submissiveness, but a heroic endurance. The “faith” here becomes almost equivalent to “hope,” except that it introduces the <span class= "ital">ground</span> of such hope: viz., confidence in the living God; it also includes the notion of <span class= "ital">faithfulness.</span><p><span class= "bld">Persecutions and tribulations.</span>—The difference-between the two words is, that while “tribulation” is quite general, and implies no personal enmities, “persecution” means that a certain set of persons were organising active measures for the annoyance of the Church.

Where faith grows, love will abound, for faith works by love. It shows faith and patience, such as may be proposed as a pattern for others, when trials from God, and persecutions from men, quicken the exercise of those graces; for the patience and faith of which the apostle gloried, bore them up, and enabled them to endure all their tribulations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God - That is, we mention your example to other churches, and glory in it, as an evidence of what the gospel is suited to do; see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19-20</a>; compare the notes on <a href="/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>.<p>For your patience - Your patient endurance of trials.<p>And faith - Fidelity, or constancy.

"Ourselves" implies that not merely did they hear others speaking of the Thessalonians' faith, but they, the missionaries themselves, boasted of it. Compare 1Th 1:8, wherein the apostle said, their faith was so well known in various places, that he and his fellow missionaries had no need to speak of it; but here he says, so abounding is their love, combined with faith and patience, that he and his fellow missionaries themselves, make it a matter of glorying in the various churches elsewhere (he was now at Corinth in Achaia, and boasted there of the faith of the Macedonian churches, 2Co 10:15-17; 8:1, at the same time giving the glory to the Lord), not only looking forward to glorying thereat at Christ's coming (1Th 2:19), but doing so even now.<p>patience&#8212;in 1Th 1:3, "patience of hope."

And it was the apostle himself, and Silvanus and Timotheus, that thus gloried in them. It adds to persons’ commendation, when it is by men of great knowledge, wisdom, and goodness. And it was by such as well knew them, and understood their state; and being instruments in their conversion, were more concerned to glory in them than any other apostles or ministers. And their glorying in them, as it respects what he said of them in the former verse, so what he further adds in this, which is their <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">patience and faith in all</span> their <span class="bld">persecutions and tribulations.</span> Persecutions are properly sufferings for righteousness’ sake: tribulations, any kind of suffering, as some distinguish. And it seems they had many of both, when he saith <span class="ital">all, </span>& c. And yet they endured them, that is, not only suffered them because they could not cast them off, but in the sense of the apostle James, <span class="bld"><a href="/james/5-11.htm" title="Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.">Jam 5:11</a></span>: <span class="ital">Behold, we count them happy which endure; </span> which is a suffering out of choice, and not mere necessity, as Moses did, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/11-25.htm" title="Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;">Hebrews 11:25</a></span>, when sufferings stand in competition with sin, or the dishonour of the Christian profession. Sufferings in themselves are not desirable, and the apostle did not glory in their sufferings, but in their <span class="ital">faith and patience.</span> As he before joined faith and love together, so here faith and patience; and as love springs from faith, so doth Christian patience, whereby it is distinguished from patience as a mere moral virtue found among the heathen, either that of the Stoics, Peripatetics, or Platonists. Faith and patience are well styled the two suffering graces, and therefore here mentioned by the apostle when he mentions their sufferings. Faith as it depends upon God, and sees love under afflictions, believes his promises, looks at the recompence of reward, &c., so it supports under suffering. And patience, as it keeps down passion, and quiets the soul under its burden, makes it to sit lighter, and gives advantage to the exercise of that grace and reason, whereby a Christian is strengthened under his sufferings. Now hereupon the apostle glories in them, as men are apt to do in the heroic acts of great conquerors; or the captain of an army, in the valiant performances of his soldiers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that we ourselves glory in you,.... Or "of you"; for though they were the subject concerning which, yet not the object in which they gloried; the apostle elsewhere advises not to glory in men, but only in the Lord; nor was this his practice contrary to his advice, for he did not boast of these persons with respect to their carnal things; he did not glory in their flesh, nor in their riches, nor wisdom, nor strength, nor any external gift; he gloried indeed of their graces, and of the exercise and increase of them; but of these not as of themselves, or as owing to him, and his fellow ministers, but as instances of the grace of God, and for which he gives thanks to him: and besides, he did not glory of these in the presence of God, in whose presence none should glory, but <p>in the churches of God; the other churches in Macedonia and Achaia, as Philippi, Berea, Corinth, &amp;c. he gave thanks to God for them, and gloried of them before men, or among the saints, to the glory of the grace of God in them, and in order to stir up other churches to an emulation and imitation of them. And the particulars he gloried of them for were as follow, <p>for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: many and sore were the reproaches, the afflictions, and persecutions that befell them for the sake of Christ, and their profession of him, and his Gospel; and which is more or less the case of everyone that will live godly in Christ Jesus: and these they endured, they bore and stood up under, they were not shocked, and staggered, and moved from the hope of the Gospel by them; which shows that the truth of grace was in them; for where there is not the root of the matter, when tribulation and affliction arise because of the profession of the word, such are offended, stumbled, and quickly gone; but these saints endured their afflictions, and with great patience, without murmuring and repining, and with great constancy, firmness, and resolution of mind. They stood fast in the grace and doctrine of faith, and in the profession of both, which they held without wavering, and none of the things they met with could move them from it. The apostle had mentioned their faith before, and he takes notice of it again, because their patience, constancy, and perseverance in sufferings, arose from it; for the trying of faith works patience, <a href="/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a>.

The progress of the Thessalonians in Christianity so rejoiced the heart of the apostle, that he expresses this joy not only in thanksgiving before God, but also in praises before men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span>] refers back to <span class="greekheb">ὑπεραυξάνει</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς αὐτούς</span>] This <span class="ital">emphatic</span> designation of the subject might be thus explained, that otherwise such praise was not the usual custom of the speakers, but that the glorious success of the gospel in Thessalonica caused them to forget the usual limits of moderation and reserve. This opinion is, however, to be rejected, because it would then without any reason be supposed that Paul had inaccurately written <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς αὐτούς</span> (<span class="ital">we ourselves</span>) instead of <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὺς ἡμᾶς</span> (<span class="ital">even we</span>).[34] It is therefore more correct to see in <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς αὐτούς</span>, that although it was true that the praise of the Thessalonians was already sufficiently spread abroad by others, yet that <span class="ital">they themselves</span>, the writers of the Epistle, in the fulness of their joy could not forbear to glory in their spiritual offspring. A reference to <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a> (de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius) is not to be assumed.

Equally incorrect is also the notion of Hofmann, that <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span> added to <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> denotes “of ourselves” “unprompted.” For it is absurd to attempt to deny that <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς αὐτούς</span> must at all events contain a contrast to others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν ἐγκαυχᾶσθαι</span>] <span class="ital">boast of you</span>. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span> is a preliminary object to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΚΑΥΧᾶΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, which is then more completely unfolded in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ Τῆς ὙΠΟΜΟΝῆς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἘΝ ΤΑῖς ἘΚΚΛΗΣΊΑΙς ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>] in Corinth and its filiated churches. The <span class="ital">cause</span> which gave occasion to Paul’s boasting of his readers is more specially expressed, being what was formerly represented as the motive of the apostolic thanksgiving; whilst formerly faith in Christ and brotherly love were mentioned (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure:">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>), the latter is here left entirely unmentioned, whilst the first is named in its special operation as Christian stedfastness under persecution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑπομονῆς ὑμῶν καὶ πίστεως</span>] is not, with Grotius, Pelt, and others, to be understood as a <span class="greekheb">ἓν διὰ δυοῖν</span>, in the sense of <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑπομονῆς ὑμῶν ἐν πίστει</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν ὑπομενούσης</span>.

T. usage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The present <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΈΧΕΣΘΕ</span></span></span> represents the persecutions and the trials as belonging to the present. Accordingly a <span class="ital">new</span> outbreak of persecution must be meant, as the First Epistle describes the persecutions as past.[36]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[34] The latter, however, is actually found in B א and some min.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] But Bouman ultimately adds (p. 85): “Cujus (sc. dicti Paulini) intacta vulgari utriusque substantivi significatione, explicandi alia etiam in promptu est, ab illa, quam memoravimus, paullo diversa via ac ratio. Etenim optimis quibusque scriptoribus non raro placuisse novimus, ut a <span class="ital">singularibus</span> ad <span class="ital">generaliora</span> nuncupanda progrederentur.

But also against this the non-repetition of the article before <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>; decides.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] That a critic such as Baur knows how to convert <span class="ital">this</span> deviation from the First Epistle into a dependence upon it is not strange (see <span class="ital">Apostel Paulus</span>, p. 488). “This present tense evidently shows how the author transfers what had been said in 1 Thess. to his own time.” Also Schrader draws from ver. 4 an objection against the authenticity of the Epistle, but for this reason: “because later in the course of the Epistle the writer appears to have forgotten that at that instant the Thessalonians were in great tribulation.” But Paul dwells on this subject throughout the whole of the first chapter. Why should he tarry longer on it, or recur to it anew, since it referred to a virtue of the Thessalonians already <span class="ital">proved</span>, whereas the <span class="ital">chief</span> object of his Epistle consisted in supplying the actual and considerable <span class="ital">wants</span> of the church in knowledge and conduct?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure:">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>. The single article groups <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονὴ</span> and <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> as a single conception = faith in its special aspect of patient endurance (<span class="ital">cf.</span> on <a href="/revelation/13-10.htm" title="He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.">Revelation 13:10</a>), faithful tenacity of purpose. M. Gebhardt, in his <span class="ital">L’Italie Mystique</span> (pp. 318 f.), observes that “the final word of Dante’s belief, of that ‘religion of the heart’ which he mentions in the <span class="ital">Convito</span>, is given in the 24th canto of the <span class="ital">Paradiso</span>. He comes back to the very simple symbol of Paul, faith, hope and love; for him as for the apostle faith is at bottom simply hope.” Faith is more than that to Paul, but sometimes hardly more. The Thessalonians are not to fear that they are holding a forlorn outpost. Neither man nor God overlooks their courage (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Plato’s <span class="ital">Theaet.</span>, xxv., <span class="greekheb">ἀνδρικῶς ὑπομεῖναι καὶ μὴ ἀνάνδρως φεύγειν</span>). Their founders and friends at a distance are watching with pride their resolute faith; while in God’s sure process of providence that faith has a destiny of its own, since it is bound up with His eternal designs. Hope is only mentioned once (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,">2 Thessalonians 2:16</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.">2 Thessalonians 3:5</a>) in this epistle, for all its preoccupation with the future. Faith covers almost all its contents here.—<span class="greekheb">θλίψεσιν</span> more general than <span class="greekheb">διωγμοῖς</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span>, as in I., <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">περί</span>, with a touch of personal interest (Abbott’s <span class="ital">Johannine Grammar</span>, p. 559; Meisterhans, <span class="ital">Gramm. d. attischen Inschriften</span>, 182).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God</span>] The triumph of the Gospel at Thessalonica had given peculiar gratification of the Apostle (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:...">1 Thessalonians 3:7-9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-20.htm" title="For you are our glory and joy.">1 Thessalonians 2:20</a>, “You are our glory and joy”). For the advantageous position of this Church and its great activity caused its testimony for Christ to spread throughout the neighbouring provinces. He is thinking now, however, of more distant Churches—those of Judæa, for example (which he calls “churches of God” in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>), and of Syria, with whom Silas and himself would be in correspondence. To them he had sent this cheering news, expressing his joy over the faith and devotion of the new converts in language of exultation. Similarly in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2 Corinthians 9:2</a> he speaks of “boasting to the Macedonians” of the liberality of Corinth. He delighted to praise one Church before another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But why does he write “we <span class="ital">ourselves</span>,” laying stress on the fact that <span class="ital">he and his companions</span> were thus boasting? Because, surely, they were slow to boast of anything that redounded to their own credit (see <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord....">2 Corinthians 12:1-6</a>, “It is not expedient for me, doubtless, to glory”), as the Thessalonians well knew (<a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ....">1 Thessalonians 2:6-7</a>); and yet they could not refrain from “boasting” over them. This unwonted and irrepressible <span class="ital">glorying before men</span> shows how deep and fervent was St Paul’s <span class="ital">thanksgiving to God</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for your patience and faith</span>] On “patience” see note to <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>. There we find <span class="ital">endurance of hope</span>, here <span class="ital">endurance and faith</span> are linked together. For it was the persistence of the Thessalonians’ faith, the way in which it endured the severest strain, that was so wonderful and made the Apostle point them out with pride to the older Churches.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you are enduring</span>: so the last clause of the verse literally reads. “Persecutions” formed the chief element in their sufferings (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="/context/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people....">Acts 17:5-9</a>); but they had to endure afflictions of many kinds.
