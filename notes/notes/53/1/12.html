The words “according to the grace” belong only to “and ye in Him:” it is the gracious will (for “grace” here has hardly its strict theological sense) of God, in which Christ concurs, that we should be thus “glorified in Him.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:11,12 Believing thoughts and expectations of the second coming of Christ should lead us to pray to God more, for ourselves and others. If there is any good in us, it is owing to the good pleasure of his goodness, and therefore it is called grace. There are many purposes of grace and good-will in God toward his people, and the apostle prays that God would complete in them the work of faith with power. This is to their doing every other good work. The power of God not only begins, but carries on the work of faith. And this is the great end and design of the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ, which is made known to us, and wrought in us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ - That is, that the Lord Jesus himself may be honored among you; the name often denoting the person. The idea is that the apostle wished that the Lord Jesus might be honored among them by the fair application and development of the principles of his religion.<p>And ye in him - That you may be regarded and treated as his friends when he shall come to judge the world.<p>According to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ - That is, that you may experience all the honor which his grace is fitted to impart.<p>In view of the exposition given of this chapter, we may remark:<p>(1) That the wicked will certainly be punished when the Lord Jesus shall come to judgment. Words cannot reveal this truth more plainly than is done in this chapter, and if it is not to be so, then language has no meaning.<p>(2) the punishment of the wicked will be eternal. It is impossible for language to teach that doctrine more clearly than is done in this chapter. If it were admitted to have been the intention of God to teach the doctrine of eternal punishment, it is impossible to conceive that he could have chosen more plain and positive language to express the doctrine than has been done here. Can it be, then, that he means to trifle with people on so solemn a subject, by using words which have no meaning?<p>(3) it will greatly aggravate the punishment of the wicked that it will be "a righteous thing" for God thus to punish them. If they were to suffer as martyrs; if in their sufferings they could feel that they were oppressed and crushed beneath mere power; if they could feel that they were right and that God was wrong; if they could get up a party in the universe against God, sympathizing with them as if they were wronged, the case would be changed. A man can endure suffering much more easily when he has a good conscience, and feels that he is right, than he can when he feels that what he endures is deserved. But the sinner in hell can never have this consolation. He will forever feel that God is right and that he is wrong, and that every pang which he endures is deserved.<p>(4) if it be a "righteous thing" that the wicked shall be punished, then they never can be saved by mere justice. No one will go to heaven because he deserves or merits it. All dependence on human merit, therefore, is taken away in the matter of salvation, and if the sinner is ever saved, it will be by grace, and not by justice.<p>(5) if it is a "righteous thing" that the sinner should perish, he will perish. God will do right to all.<p>(6) it is amazing that the mass of men have so little concern about their future condition. God has plainly revealed that he will destroy the wicked forever, and that it will be a righteous thing for him to do it; and yet the mass of mankind are wholly unconcerned, and disregard all the solemn declarations of the Bible on this subject as if they were idle tales. One would suppose that the very possibility of eternal suffering would rouse all the sensibilities of the soul, and lead to the earnest inquiry whether it is not possible to avoid it. Yet the mass of people feel no concern in this inquiry. It is impossible to ever get them to think of it. We cannot get them even to ask the question, seriously, whether they themselves are to be happy or miserable for all eternity. This stupidity and indifference is the most unaccountable fact on earth, and probably distinguishes this world from all others.<p>(7) it is rational to think of religion; to reflect on eternity; to be serious; to be anxious about the future state. If there is even a possibility that we may be miserable forever, it is proper to be serious about it. And if there is a solemn declaration of God that it will be a "righteous thing" for him to punish the wicked, and that he will "punish them with everlasting destruction," assuredly the mind should be concerned. Is there anything more worthy the calm and sober attention of the human soul than such solemn declarations of the infinite God? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. the name of our Lord Jesus&#8212;Our Lord Jesus in His manifested personality as the God-man.<p>in you, and ye in him&#8212;reciprocal glorification; compare Isa 28:5, "The Lord of hosts shall be &#8230; a crown of glory and &#8230; a diadem of beauty unto &#8230; His people," with Isa 62:3, "Thou (Zion) shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem," &c.

All expositors agree that these words contain in them a final cause, as the Greek word imports; and so understand them as the ultimate end of the apostle’s prayer for them; he had prayed for things that did concern their salvation, but he looked further, which was, that thereby the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified in them. The glory of Christ and the saints’ salvation are wrapt up together; and though they are to look immediately to the latter, yet ultimately to the former. But whether the apostle means the glorifying Christ in this life, or the life to come, is a question. I rather think the words refer to the life to come, when the name of Christ shall be for ever glorified in the salvation of his people, when all the good pleasure of God’s goodness shall be fulfilled upon them, they having been kept in the faith by the power of God unto the end, through Jesus Christ; and then also they shall be glorified not only by him, as we may read the text, but in him, in being received into a participation of the same glory with Jesus Christ, and by their union with him are glorified in him, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/17-22.htm" title="And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:">John 17:22</a> <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a> <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1Jo 3:2</a></span>. And when this is done, then have they received the prize of their calling, then is the whole good pleasure of God’s goodness fulfilled, then is the work of faith accomplished; which things the apostle saith he prayed for in their behalf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ:</span> what the apostle before called the good pleasure of God’s goodness, he here calls his <span class="ital">grace, </span> and he adds the grace of Christ, because the grace or favour of both are so eminently manifested in these things, whereby not only the name of God, but of Christ also, shall be glorified, as he said before; and that it may be glorified in them according to his grace, that is, greatly glorified; and they glorified in him according to the grace of God and Jesus Christ, that is, greatly glorified, as we may further understand the words; the grace of God being exceeding great towards them in Jesus Christ.

This is the end of the apostle's prayer, and which is answered by the fulfilment of the things prayed for; as the name of Christ and his Gospel are dishonoured, by the unbelief, cowardice and the unworthy walk of professors; so they are glorified in and by the saints, by their faith, patience, and good works in this world; which not only themselves adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, but cause others to glorify him likewise; and Christ will be glorified in them hereafter, by the glory which will be conferred upon them, and which will reflect glory upon him; when all the gracious designs of God are accomplished on them and the work of faith is finished in them; for should not these be completed, Christ would lose the glory of redemption and salvation, which by means of these will be given by the saints to him to all eternity: <p>and ye in him; that is, that ye may be glorified; the saints are now glorified in him as their head and representative, being raised together and made to sit together in heavenly places in him; and when the work of grace is finished upon their souls, they will be glorified together with him and by him; and in the resurrection morn shall appear in glory with him both in soul and body, and shall be made like him, and everlastingly enjoy him and see him as he is; the Alexandrian copy reads and us "in him"; and all this will be as it is wished for, "according to the grace of our God, and the Lord Jesus Christ"; according to the grace and free favour of God in election, and of Jesus Christ in, redemption, and of the blessed Spirit in sanctification; for election, redemption, calling, justification, pardon, adoption, and the whole of salvation from first to last are of grace and not of works; and according to this, all these things must be prayed for the application of, and must be expected only on such a foot; and to this must all be ascribed, the glory of which is the ultimate end of God, in all he has done, does, or will do for his people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm" title="That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ κυρίου ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span>] The <span class="ital">name</span> of our Lord Jesus, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> so far as He is the <span class="greekheb">κύριος</span>, the <span class="ital">Lord</span>; comp. <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Php 2:9</a> ff.

There is nothing he desires in his own case so much as “that Christ may be magnified” (<a href="/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.">Php 1:20</a>); nor anything that he covets more eagerly for his friends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But now it is the Saviour’s <span class="ital">name</span> that is to be glorified; for their salvation, when complete, will set forth with astonishing lustre the Divine-human name of <span class="ital">our Lord Jesus</span>.

Its usage springs from the nature of the Gospel of Christ, as that expresses the character of God and His relationship towards men. (1) The radical sense of Grace (<span class="ital">charis</span>) in common Greek is <span class="ital">pleasingness</span>. From the artistic feeling of the Greek mind, this came to be synonymous with <span class="ital">loveliness</span> (<span class="ital">gracefulness</span>), which was idolized in the three Graces (<span class="ital">Charites</span>), embodiments of all that is charming in person and in social life. Such was the connection of this word with religion in classical Greek. (2) It further signified <span class="ital">pleasingness of disposition, favour</span>—both in the active sense (<span class="ital">a</span>) of <span class="ital">obligingness, graciousness</span>; and in the passive sense (b) of <span class="ital">acceptableness</span>. In the Greek of the O.T., <a href="/psalms/45-2.htm" title="You are fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into your lips: therefore God has blessed you for ever.">Psalm 45:2</a>, “Grace is poured into thy lips,” supplies an example of (<span class="ital">a</span>), similarly <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm" title=" Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.">Colossians 4:6</a>; while (<span class="ital">b</span>) is exemplified in the familiar phrase, to “find grace in the eyes of” so and so (comp. <a href="/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>). On 2<span class="ital">a</span> is based the specific N.T. signification of Grace, so conspicuous in St Paul. It denotes, therefore, (3) <span class="ital">the favour of God towards mankind, revealed in Jesus Christ</span>. Hence, on the one hand, it stands in contrast with <span class="ital">human sin and ill-desert</span> (“where sin multiplied, grace superabounded,” <a href="/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>); and is the moving cause of man’s salvation, embodied and acting in Jesus Christ, above all in His death upon the Cross (<a href="/john/1-17.htm" title="For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.">John 1:17</a>; <a href="/titus/2-11.htm" title="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,">Titus 2:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>; &c.): God’s grace is His redeeming love to sinners. On the other hand, it is the attribute of <span class="ital">God’s Fatherhood</span>: “Grace to you … from God the Father” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 1:2</a>, &c.; comp. ch. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,">2 Thessalonians 2:16</a>; <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>). The revelation of the Grace and the Fatherhood of God go together. Grace acts in the way of <span class="ital">forgiveness</span> (St Paul’s “forgive” in <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm" title=" Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.">Colossians 3:13</a>, is derived from <span class="ital">charis</span>, and signifies to “show grace”), and in the <span class="ital">free gift</span> of the blessings of salvation (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>, &c.). Hence, in the Apostle’s teaching, Grace is opposed not only to <span class="ital">sin</span> which it conquers and destroys, but to human <span class="ital">merit</span> which it sets aside—to “works of law” regarded as means of our salvation, and to everything that would make God’s benefits conferred on us in Christ matters of “debt” on His part: see <a href="/context/romans/3-19.htm" title="Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God....">Romans 3:19-21</a>; <a href="/context/romans/4-4.htm" title="Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt....">Romans 4:4-15</a>; <a href="/context/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,...">Galatians 2:15-21</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;...">Ephesians 2:1-10</a>, for the establishment of this leading principle of St Paul’s doctrine. It is the idea of <span class="ital">mercy</span> (not <span class="ital">grace</span>) that in the O.T. brings us nearest to this N.T. conception. But while the former expresses God’s pitiful disposition as the Almighty toward man who is weak and wretched, this denotes His loving, forgiving disposition as our Father in Christ toward sinful and lost men.—Two further uses of the word, arising out of this principal use, should be noted. Grace signifies (4) sometimes <span class="ital">an act</span>, or <span class="ital">bestowment of God’s grace</span>—this or that manifestation of grace (<a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>). (5) Sometimes, again, it denotes a <span class="ital">state of grace</span> in man,—God’s grace realized and operative in the Christian: “this grace in which we stand,” <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a> (comp. <a href="/2_timothy/2-1.htm" title="You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.">2 Peter 3:18</a>; &c.).—(6) Lastly, <span class="ital">charis</span> bears in the N.T. and in common Greek the sense of <span class="ital">thanks, gratefulness</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The course of the Apostle’s Thanksgiving has carried his readers far away from their present troubles into a region of heavenly rest and triumph; while for a moment, by the way, it lifts the curtain to reveal the judgement hanging over their tormentors. The “vengeance” that awaits the latter, and the “relief” that awaits the former, are in each case a just and inevitable recompense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm" title="That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ ὄνομα</span>, <span class="ital">the name</span>) We confer nothing on the Lord, whereas the Lord really confers upon us salvation; and hence His <span class="ital">name</span> is glorified in us; and <span class="ital">we</span> ourselves moreover in Him.—<span class="greekheb">χάριν</span>, <span class="ital">grace</span>) with this <span class="ital">grace</span> in view, he mentioned <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθωσύνης</span>, <span class="ital">of goodness</span>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm" title="Why also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>—————<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> or simply, <span class="accented">of our Lord Jesus</span>, "Christ" not being in the original. The "name of our Lord Jesus" is not a mere periphrasis for the Lord Jesus himself, but the name denotes his nature and character. The second petition of our Lord's prayer is "Hallowed be thy Name," and this the apostle applies to Christ; he prays that his Name may be hallowed among the Thessalonians - an incidental proof of his divinity. <span class="cmt_word">May be glorified in you, and you in him;</span> a twofold glorification: Christ is glorified in believers, when by their holiness they promote his cause and reflect his glory; and believers are glorified in Christ, when they receive out of his infinite fulness. <span class="cmt_word">According to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Some suppose that the epithet "God" also belongs to Jesus Christ, but the construction hardly bears this meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The name (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)<p>In no case where it is joined with Jesus, or Christ, or Lord Jesus, does it mean the title or dignity.
