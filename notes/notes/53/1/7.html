We cannot by all our sufferings, any more than by our services, merit heaven; but by our patience under sufferings, we are prepared for the promised joy. Nothing more strongly marks a man for eternal ruin, than a spirit of persecution and enmity to the name and people of God. God will trouble those that trouble his people. And there is a rest for the people of God; a rest from sin and sorrow. The certainty of future recompence is proved by the righteousness of God. The thoughts of this should be terrible to wicked men, and support the righteous. Faith, looking to the great day, is enabled partly to understand the book of providence, which appears confused to unbelievers. The Lord Jesus will in that day appear from heaven. He will come in the glory and power of the upper world. His light will be piercing, and his power consuming, to all who in that day shall be found as chaff. This appearance will be terrible to those that know not God, especially to those who rebel against revelation, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the great crime of multitudes, the gospel is revealed, and they will not believe it; or if they pretend to believe, they will not obey it. Believing the truths of the gospel, is in order to our obeying the precepts of the gospel. Though sinners may be long spared, they will be punished at last. They did sin's work, and must receive sin's wages. Here God punishes sinners by creatures as instruments; but then, it will be destruction from the Almighty; and who knows the power of his anger? It will be a joyful day to some, to the saints, to those who believe and obey the gospel. In that bright and blessed day, Christ Jesus will be glorified and admired by his saints. And Christ will be glorified and admired in them. His grace and power will be shown, when it shall appear what he has purchased for, and wrought in, and bestowed upon those who believe in him. Lord, if the glory put upon thy saints shall be thus admired, how much more shalt thou be admired, as the Bestower of that glory! The glory of thy justice in the damnation of the wicked will be admired, but not as the glory of thy mercy in the salvation of believers. How will this strike the adoring angels with holy admiration, and transport thy admiring saints with eternal rapture! The meanest believer shall enjoy more than the most enlarged heart can imagine while we are here; Christ will be admired in all those that believe, the meanest believer not excepted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to you who are troubled - That is, "it will be a righteous thing for God to give to you who are persecuted rest in the last day." As it will be right and proper to punish the wicked, so it will he right to reward the good. It will not, however, be in precisely the same sense. The wicked will deserve all that they will suffer, but it cannot be said that the righteous will deserve the reward which they will receive. It will be right and proper, because:<p>(1) there is a fitness that they who are the friends of God should be treated as such, or it is proper that he should show himself to be their friend; and,<p>(2) because in this life this is not always clearly done. They are often less prospered, and less happy in their outward circumstances, than the wicked. There is, therefore, a propriety that in the future state God should manifest himself as their friend, and show to assembled worlds that he is not indifferent to character, or that wickedness does not deserve his smiles, and piety incur his frown. At the same time, however, it will be owing wholly to his grace that any are ever admitted to heaven.<p>Rest - The future happiness of believers is often represented under the image of rest. It is rest like that of the weary laborer after his day of toil; rest, like that of the soldier after the hardships of a long and perilous march; rest, like the calm repose of one who has been racked with pain; see the notes on <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>. The word "rest" here (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  anesis) means a letting loose, a remission, a relaxation; and hence composure, quiet; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>.<p>With us - That is, with Paul, Silas, and Timothy; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>. It would increase the comfort of the Thessalonians derived from the anticipation of the future world, to reflect that they would meet their religious teachers and friends there. It always augments the anticipated joy of heaven to reflect that we are to share its blessedness with them. There is no envy among those who anticipate heaven; there will be none there. They who desire heaven at all, desire that it may be shared in the highest degree by all who are dear to them.<p>When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven - Shall appear; shall come from heaven; see the notes, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>.<p>With his mighty angels - Margin, "angels of his power."

The sense is, that angels of exalted rank and glory will accompany him; see the <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a> note; <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. rest&#8212;governed by "to recompense" (2Th 1:6). The Greek is literally, "relaxation"; loosening of the tension which had preceded; relaxing of the strings of endurance now so tightly drawn. The Greek word for "rest," Mt 11:28, is distinct, namely, cessation from labor. Also, Heb 4:9, "A keeping of sabbath."<p>with us&#8212;namely, Paul, Silas, and Timothy, the writers, who are troubled like yourselves.<p>when&#8212;at the time when &#8230; ; not sooner, not later.<p>with his mighty angels&#8212;rather as the Greek, "with the angels of His might," or "power," that is, the angels who are the ministers by whom He makes His might to be recognized (Mt 13:41, 52). It is not their might, but His might, which is the prominent thought.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having spoken of the recompence of the troublers, here of the <span class="bld">troubled:</span> and in this we may observe a parallel, as in the former. The recompence to these is expressed by <span class="bld">rest; </span> in the Greek, dismission, or cessation from labour or trouble; as <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a></span>: <span class="ital">There remaineth a rest to the people of God, </span> where the word is, keeping a sabbath, importing a rest from labour, as this text doth speak of a rest from trouble. And though the word <span class="ital">rest</span> is properly negative, yet under it the apostle comprehends all the felicity of the future state; elsewhere called a crown, a kingdom, an inheritance, glory, salvation, eternal life, yea, it contains in it the perfect satisfaction of the soul in the fruition of God, &c. And this is said to be given them by way of recompence, as tribulation is to their troublers; though there is no parity between their trembles and the rest, that is, their recompence, yet it is a proper recompence; and therefore the grace and mercy of God will be much manifested therein, though it is said to come from God’s righteousncss in the text. The righteousness of God dispenseth both these recompences; but yet the righteousness in both is not alike; akribodikaion, strict justice, dispenseth the one, and the punishment of the wicked riseth from the nature of their sin, and the merit of it; but it is only epieikeia, equity, that dispenseth the other, and that not so much with respect to the nature of the saints’ duties or sufferings, as the promises and ordinance of God, and the merit of Christ for them. And this rest the apostle sets forth before them, under a twofold circumstance: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="bld">Rest with us.</span> <span class="ital">Us, </span> the apostles and ministers of Christ, we and you shall rest together; as we have partaken of troubles together, so we shall of rest. And you shall enjoy the same felicity with the apostles themselves, in the same state of rest.

Now the heavens contain him, but he will come in person, and his glory shine forth: though before that their souls shall be at rest in heaven, and their bodies in the grave, yet not till then shall their persons be at rest. And as Christ himself is already entered into his rest, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/4-10.htm" title="For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.">Hebrews 4:10</a></span>, so he will come again to take his people into the same rest with him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And to you who are troubled, rest with us,.... This is another branch of the justice of God, in rendering to them who are afflicted and persecuted for righteousness sake, "rest"; a relaxation or rest from persecutions, for a while at least; as the churches of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had, from that persecution raised at the death of Stephen, <a href="/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31</a> and as the Christians had at the destruction of Jerusalem; which though it was a day of vengeance to the unbelieving Jews, were times of refreshing to the saints, who were now delivered from their persecutors: or rather this designs a rest which remains for the saints after death in the grave, and at the coming of the Lord, and to all eternity; when they shall rest from all their toil and labour, and be freed from sin, and all disquietude by it, and from the temptations of Satan, and likewise from the persecutions of men; see <a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>. And this will be enjoyed in company with the apostles, and other believers; and as it is some alleviation to the sufferings and afflictions of saints now, that the same are accomplished in others, so it will enhance the heavenly glory, rest, and felicity, that they will be partners and sharers in it with the apostles of Christ Jesus, and have the same crown of glory they have; and indeed their company and conversation will be a part of their happiness. <p>When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven; then will the justice of God take place in both the above branches and instances of it, rendering tribulation to persecutors, and rest to the persecuted. Christ, ever since a cloud received him out of the sight of the apostles up to heaven, has been, as it were, hid, and has not been seen with corporeal eyes by men on earth ever since, but by a very few, as Stephen, and the Apostle Paul; he has only been seen by an eye of faith; at his second coming there will be a revelation of him, and every eye shall see him: and this revelation of him will be "from heaven": thither he was received at his ascension, and there he now is; and here he is received, and will be retained until the end of all things; and from hence the saints expect him, and from hence will he descend in person, and then he will be revealed, and appear to the view of everyone: and that <p>with his mighty angels; which will add to the glory, majesty, and solemnity of that appearance: these are called his angels, because he is the Creator of them, and the object of their worship and adoration, and he is the Lord and head of them, and they are ministering spirits to him and his; and "mighty" angels, because they excel all other creatures in strength; a remarkable instance of the might and strength of angels is in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. The words from the original text may be rendered, "with the angels of his power"; as they are by the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, for they will be the ministers of the power of Christ in gathering the elect from the four winds, and all nations, before Christ; and in taking out of his kingdom all that offend, and do iniquity; and in severing the righteous from the wicked; and in casting the latter into the furnace of fire. The Syriac version reads the words, "with the power of his angels". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And to you who are troubled rest <span class="cverse3">{4}</span> with us, <span class="cverse3">{5}</span> when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</span><p>(4) He strengthens and encourages them also along the way by this means, that the condition both of this present state and the state to come, is common to him with them.<p>(5) A most glorious description of the second coming of Christ, to be set against all the miseries of the godly, and the triumphs of the wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/2_thessalonians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Θλιβομένοις</span> is passive.

The word "rest" here is a noun in the accusative, not a verb, as English readers might at the first glance suppose. It literally denotes relaxation, case. The meaning of the passage is that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense rest to you who are afflicted. The recompense of the persecutors - those who afflict, is affliction; the recompense of the persecuted - the afflicted, is rest (comp. <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28, 29</a>). The rest or relaxation here mentioned is that which awaits believers, not in this world, but in the next, "where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest" (<a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>). "There remaineth a rest for the people of God" (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>). The happiness of heaven on its negative side, as freedom from earthly affliction and persecution, is here stated. It is rest to the weary, freedom to the enslaved, release from sorrow, suffering, and pain, relaxation from toil, ease from noise and turmoil, the quiet haven of peace after being tossed about in the tempestuous ocean. <span class="cmt_word">With us;</span> that is, not with us believers in general, or with us the  apostles, the champions of the faith, and still less with us Jews, the saints of israel; but with us, the writers of this Epistle, namely, Paul and Silas and Timothy. <span class="cmt_word">When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed</span>; or, more literally, <span class="accented">at the revelation or apocalypse of the Lord Jesus.</span> The advent of Christ is generally expressed by another word, <span class="accented">parousia</span>, denoting "presence;" here the word is <span class="accented">apocalypse</span>, bringing before us in a more vivid manner the visible manifestation of Christ.
