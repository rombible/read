They are God's laws, therefore thou shalt do them, to that end were they given thee; do them, and dispute them not; do them, and draw not back; do them, not carelessly and hypocritically, but with thy heart and soul, thy whole heart and thy whole soul. We forswear ourselves, and break the most sacred engagement, if, when we have taken the Lord to be our God, we do not make conscience of obeying his commands. We are elected to obedience, 1Pe 1:2; chosen that we should be holy, Eph 1:4; purified a peculiar people, that we might not only do good works, but be zealous in them, Tit 2:14.

The Targums interpret both these verses of the people of Israel choosing and making the Lord their King, and of his being made King over them; and so it respects their peculiar form of civil government, being a theocracy. The Lord's people in Christ are a peculiar people; they are distinct from all people, and are peculiarly regarded by him; they are the objects of his peculiar love, and receive peculiar favours from him; and whom having chosen and redeemed, he calls by his special grace, and witnesses their special relation to him by his Spirit; which grace obliges and excites them to a cheerful obedience to his commands. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{o}</span> And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that <i>thou</i> shouldest keep all his commandments;</span><p>(o) Signifying that there is a mutual bond between God and his people.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">Jehovah hath caused thee to say</span> <span class="ital">this day</span> <span class="bld">that thou wilt be unto him a peculiar people … and wilt</span> <span class="ital">keep all his commandments</span>] Elsewhere in D the singular relation of Israel to Jehovah is stated as His promise and act, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, <span class="ital">q.v.</span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/27-9.htm" title="And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Take heed, and listen, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 27:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/29-13.htm" title="That he may establish you to day for a people to himself, and that he may be to you a God, as he has said to you, and as he has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.">Deuteronomy 29:13</a> (12).

It is true that only a prayer after taking the second tithe in the third year is commanded here; but that is simply because this tithe was appropriated everywhere throughout the land to festal meals for the poor and destitute (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>), when prayer before the Lord would not follow per analogiam from the previous injunction concerning the presentation of first-fruits, as it would in the case of the tithes with which sacrificial meals were prepared at the sanctuary (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>.). &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is the infinitive Hiphil for &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, as in <a href="/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a> (on this form, vid., Ges. 53, 3 Anm. 2 and 7, and Ew. 131, b. and 244, b.). "Saying before the Lord" does not denote prayer in the sanctuary (at the tabernacle), but, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-7.htm">Genesis 27:7</a>, simply prayer before God the omnipresent One, who is enthroned in heaven (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>), and blesses His people from above from His holy habitation. The declaration of having fulfilled the commandments of God refers primarily to the directions concerning the tithes, and was such a rendering of an account as springs from the consciousness that a man very easily transgresses the commandments of God, and has nothing in common with the blindness of pharisaic self-righteousness "I have cleaned out the holy out of my house:" the holy is that which is sanctified to God, that which belongs to the Lord and His servants, as in <a href="/leviticus/21-22.htm">Leviticus 21:22</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; signifies not only to remove, but to clean out, wipe out. That which was sanctified to God appeared as a debt, which was to be wiped out of a man's house (Schultz). </body></html>
