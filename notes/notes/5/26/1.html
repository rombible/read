And our creature comforts are doubly sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the Fountain of all consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two liturgical enactments having a clear and close reference to the whole of the preceding legislation, form a most appropriate and significant conclusion to it, namely,<p>(1) the formal acknowledgment in deed and symbol of God's faithfulness, by presentment of a basket filled with firstfruits, and in word by recitation of the solemn formula prescribed in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-3.htm">Deuteronomy 26:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5-10</a>; and<p>(2) the solemn declaration and profession on the part of each Israelite on the occasion of the third tithe <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 26<p>De 26:1-15.

The offerer was to accompany his presentation with the declaration, "I profess this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord swore unto our fathers for to give us;" and the priest having set the basket down before the altar, the offerer was to make confession and prayer, gratefully acknowledging the Divine favor showed to Israel in choosing them to be a great nation, in delivering them out of Egypt, and bringing them into a rich and fertile land; and along with this his bounty to the individual who now presented the firstfruits of his land unto the Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The duty of integrity in trade is once more enforced in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13-16</a> (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>).
