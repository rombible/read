Or the reference may be here to the expenses incurred by the death of one for whose funeral the individual had to provide. This view is adopted by Dr. Thomson, who, remarking on this passage, says, "This was the strongest possible protestation that he had dealt faithfully in the matter of tithing and consecrated things and in charities to the poor. He had not allowed himself to divert anything to other uses, not even by the most pressing and unforeseen emergencies. It is here assumed, or rather implied, that times of mourning for the dead were expensive, and also that the stern law of custom obliged the bereaved to defray those expenses, however onerous.... The temptation, therefore, to devote a part of the tithes, hallowed things, and charities to defray these enormous, unforeseen, and providential expenses would be very urgent, and he who stood faithful at such times might safely be trusted on all other occasions" ('Land and the Book,' 1:149). The LXX. rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "to the dead," has led some to suppose that the reference here is to the placing of articles of food in the tomb along with the corpse; but though this custom prevailed among the Jews in later times, as well as among other peoples, there is no ground for supposing it to be referred to here. As all connected with a dead body was held to be unclean, as well as the body itself, a house of mourning with its inhabitants was held to he unclean, and into it, therefore, nothing that had been hallowed might be lawfully carried. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1488;&#1489;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, "a lost (perishing) Aramaean was my father" (not the Aramaean, Laban, wanted to destroy my father, Jacob, as the Chald., Arab., Luther, and others render it). &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; signifies not only going astray, wandering, but perishing, in danger of perishing, as in <a href="/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>, etc. Jacob is referred to, for it was he who went down to Egypt in few men.
