It would seem that something was still to be gathered from the trees after the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus there would still be some produce untithed at that feast in any given year. But the tithe of the third year must be separated to the very last item before the Passover of the fourth.<p><span class= "bld">The third year, which is the year of tithing.</span>—See <a href="/context/deuteronomy/14-28.htm" title="At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:">Deuteronomy 14:28-29</a>.

The following words are also taken to refer to the details of the law respecting these matters.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">I have not eaten thereof in my mourning.</span>—“When I was clean and they were unclean, or when they were clean and I was unclean” (Rashi).

Every year a tithe was paid to the Levites; and besides that a second tithe, which was carried to Jerusalem and eaten there; and every third year it was eaten at home, in their towns and cities in the country instead of it, with the Levite, poor and stranger, and was called the poor's tithe; and hence the Targum of Jonathan here calls this year the year of the poor's tithe, as was also the sixth year, and was reckoned not complete till the passover in the following year, as the Jewish writers (l) say: <p>and hath given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow; that is, the poor's tithe of the third year, which these were to eat of with the owner, <a href="/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>; though the Jews commonly distinguish the Levite from the rest, and suppose that both first and second tithes are meant, the one to be given to the former, and the other to the latter; so the Targum of Jonathan and Jarchi: <p>that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled: for this was a considerable entertainment, a sort of a feast, a full meal, however; hence it is concluded, as Jarchi says, that they did not give less of corn to a poor man than half a kab of wheat, which was above three pints. <p>(k) In Misn.

The tithe here referred to is the vegetable or predial tithe, which, at the end of each third year, as here prescribed, was to be converted into a gift to the poor and needy. This, properly the second tithe (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but usually called the third tithe (Tobit 1:7, 8; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 22), is quite distinct from the Levitical tithe prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a> and <a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-32</a>; and it is a mistake to suppose that the law here was designed to contravene or supersede that in the earlier books (see Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:1010). As this tithe completed the triennial series of tithes which the Israelites had to offer, it was fitting that in presenting it a solemn declaration should be made by the offerer to the effect that he had honorably and conscientiously discharged all the obligations in this respect which the Law laid upon him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third year, which is the year of tithing</span>. As each week ended with a Sabbath, so a sabbatical year ended each cycle or week of years; and as on it no tithes were levied, "the year of tithing" here specified would be the third and the sixth years in each septennial period. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1488;&#1489;&#1497; &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, "a lost (perishing) Aramaean was my father" (not the Aramaean, Laban, wanted to destroy my father, Jacob, as the Chald., Arab., Luther, and others render it). &#1488;&#1489;&#1491; signifies not only going astray, wandering, but perishing, in danger of perishing, as in <a href="/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>, etc. Jacob is referred to, for it was he who went down to Egypt in few men.
