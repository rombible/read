But the argument has been deranged (so all recent commentators; see esp. Cullen, p. 93) either by later additions inappropriately distributed through a misunderstanding of the legal form used, or through the fusion of different conclusions to the Code. See notes below. It is unnecessary to suppose that the passage originally followed <a href="/deuteronomy/27-9.htm" title="And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Take heed, and listen, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 27:9</a> f. or 28.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though the term <span class="ital">covenant</span> is not used, the law-giving is regarded as such, as it is implicitly in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-9.htm" title="And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Take heed, and listen, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 27:9</a> f. and explicitly in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-1.htm" title="These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 29:1</a> (Deut 28:69). This idea is also implicit in the Code, and is stated explicitly in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm" title="But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm" title="And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>. So far then, there is no reason for doubting the original character of the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is so far an answer to Steuern. who assigns the passage to a later deuteronomist. Wellh. indeed takes <span class="ital">this day</span> as that of the Covenant at Ḥoreb, and infers that chs. 12–26 were originally understood as delivered there. On the other hand Berth, finds it probable that we have here the formula under which Josiah bound Israel to observe the Law (<a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm" title="And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.
