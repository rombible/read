Said, affirmed, protested, and in the most solemn manner declared, that the Lord was their God, and him only; and that they would have no other God, nor worship, serve, or obey any other. The Lord is the God of all mankind, as he is the Creator and Preserver of them, and was of the people of Israel in a peculiar manner, they being chosen, redeemed, and privileged by him above all others; and especially is of his elect in Christ among all nations, whom he has loved and set apart for himself, and determined to save; whom he has adopted and regenerated; he provides for them, protects and preserves them, gives them grace here and glory hereafter: he is their God in Christ, and by virtue of the covenant of his grace made with them in him; and is known by them to be so in the effectual calling by the application of covenant blessings to them; and which is certified to them by the Spirit of God, upon which they claim their interest in him, and make profession of him as their God: <p>and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice; that is, this was then their resolution and determination, their protestation and declaration, to walk in all the ways of God, both in private and in public, he directed unto; and to observe all his laws, ceremonial, moral, and judicial, which he had given them as the rule of their walk and behaviour; and to regard whatsoever he should reveal by his prophets and ministers as his will; and a view of covenant interest in God lays all good men under the strongest obligation in the strength of divine grace to attend to his will; nor can there be a greater motive to them than covenant love, grace, and mercy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Thou hast avouched the Lord</span>, etc.] i.e. acknowledged (see Wright’s <span class="ital">Bible Word Book</span>); lit. <span class="bld">caused Jehovah to say that He will be thy God</span>.

It is probably a technical legal term, by which either of the two parties to a contract made the other utter a declaration of his obligation under it. Here it is figuratively applied to the contract between Jehovah and Israel. They did not actually cause Him to make this engagement, for His choice of them was an act of His free grace (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm" title="But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, has the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of slaves, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>, etc.) and every covenant with Him was of His imposition (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-2.htm" title="The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm" title="But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>). But by engaging to keep His laws Israel fulfilled the condition in which alone He could be their God. Therefore the formula, if not literally, is substantially, correct. The clever EVV. rendering <span class="ital">avouched</span> is unjustified by the Heb. form but has evidently been adopted to cover all the contradictory contents of the declaration; the text however is so deranged that it fails fully to do so.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and that thou shouldest walk in his ways</span>, etc.] This belongs properly not to Jehovah’s, but to Israel’s, declaration, whereas the promise in <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/26-19.htm" title="And to make you high above all nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be an holy people to the LORD your God, as he has spoken.">Deuteronomy 26:19</a></span>, <span class="ital">and to make thee high above all nations</span>, etc., which is attributed to them belongs, of course, to Him. There has been a displacement of the text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Syriac seeks to get rid of the difficulty by eliminating the conjunction at the beginning of the phrase here, so as to read <span class="ital">by walking in his ways</span>, etc.; but even so the difficulty is only partly removed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast avouched</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">Thou hast caused Jehovah this day to say to be a God unto thee</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thou hast given occasion to him to declare himself to be thy God, and (as a consequence of this) that thou shouldest walk in his ways and keep his commandments.

The presentation of the first-fruits took place, no doubt, on their pilgrimages to the sanctuary at the three yearly festivals (ch. 16); but it is quite without ground that Riehm restricts these words to the sacrificial meals to be prepared from the tithes, as if they had been the only sacrificial meals (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>). </body></html>
