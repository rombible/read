The crime is supposed to be committed by one of the cities of Israel. Even when they were ordered to preserve their religion by force, yet they were not allowed to bring others to it by fire and sword. Spiritual judgments under the Christian dispensation are more terrible than the execution of criminals; we have not less cause than the Israelites had, to fear the Divine wrath. Let us then fear the spiritual idolatry of covetousness, and the love of worldly pleasure; and be careful not to countenance them in our families, by our example or by the education of our children.

In <a href="/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>, Belial is rendered in the Authorized Version as an adjective, "wicked," and also in <a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>. In <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>, it is rendered by "ungodly men." Most commonly it is treated as a proper name. But in all places the proper meaning of the word might be retained.

The clause, "son of thy mother," is not intended to describe the brother as a step-brother, but simply to bring out the closeness of the fraternal relation; like the description of the wife as the wife of thy bosom, who lies in thy bosom, rests upon thy breast (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54</a>; <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>), and of the friend as "thy friend which is as thine own soul," i.e., whom thou lovest as much as thy life (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; belongs to &#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1514;: if the temptation occurred in secret, and therefore the fact might be hidden from others. The power of love and relationship, which flesh and blood find it hard to resist, is placed here in contrast with the supposed higher or divine authority of the seducers. As the persuasion was already very seductive, from the fact that it proceeded from the nearest blood-relations and most intimate friends, and was offered in secret, it might become still more so from the fact that it recommended the worship of a deity that had nothing in common with the forbidden idols of Canaan, and the worship of which, therefore, might appear of less consequence, or commend itself by the charm of peculiarity and novelty. To prevent this deceptive influence of sin, it is expressly added in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-8.htm">Deuteronomy 13:8</a> (7), "of the gods nigh unto thee or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth," i.e., whatever gods there might be upon the whole circuit of the earth. </body></html>
