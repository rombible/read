The reasonableness of what Moses here enjoins is manifest. For the existence and infinite perfections of the <span class="ital">one living and true God, </span>the truth and goodness of his religion, and the authority of his laws being already so fully demonstrated by evidences of all kinds, evidences continued, and beyond all exception; and, on the contrary, the gods of the heathen being so evidently either nonentities or false pretenders to divinity, and their worship so full of absurdity, folly, and the worst kinds of wickedness, it was not to be thought that a mere miracle, or a number of miracles or wonders, for the performance of which, if really performed, they could not account, or the fulfilling of a prediction, by any opposer of the true God, was a sufficient reason why they should abandon God’s worship, call in question the truth of his religion, or go after any other god. Moses properly teaches them that the true divinity of miracles and wonders ought to be judged of by the doctrines, designs, and purposes, for the abetting and confirming whereof they were wrought; that every pretender to miracles, who would seduce men to false and irrational principles of religion, was to be looked upon as an impostor, and notwithstanding all he could do or say, they were steadily to adhere to the service of Him who had given them so many proofs that he, and he alone, was the true God, and to his religion and worship, which had been so amply confirmed; concluding that God, by permitting such impostors, intended only to try their faith and sincerity. Compare <a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world....">1 John 4:1-6</a>. We may infer from hence, that the attempts of the Roman Catholics to prove their peculiar doctrines by miracles are vain; for they ought first to show them to be agreeable to reason and religion, before they attempt to prove them by miracles. For so long as they appear contrary to reason and Scripture, and repugnant to common sense, it will never be in the power of miracles, how numerous and stupendous soever, to establish the truth of them. Far less of their pretended miracles, which are nothing else but mere tricks and impostures.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-5 Moses had cautioned against the peril that might arise from the Canaanites. Here he cautions against the rise of idolatry among themselves. It is needful for us to be well acquainted with the truths and precepts of the Bible; for we may expect to be proved by temptations of evil under the appearance of good, of error in the guise of truth; nor can any thing rightly oppose such temptations, but the plain, express testimony of God's word to the contrary. And it would be a proof of sincere affection for God, that, notwithstanding specious pretences, they should not be wrought upon the forsake God, and follow other gods to serve them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord had said, "Thou shalt have none other gods but Me." A prophet is here supposed who invites the people "to go after other gods." To such a one no credit is under any circumstances to be given, even should he show signs and wonders to authenticate his doctrine. The standing rule of faith and practice had been laid down once for all - that the people were to hold fast. The prophet who propounded another rule could only be an impostor.<p>A different case is considered in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 13<p>De 13:1-5. Enticers to Idolatry to Be Put to Death.<p>1. If there arise among you a prophet&#8212;The special counsels which follow arose out of the general precept contained in De 12:32; and the purport of them is, that every attempt to seduce others from the course of duty which that divine standard of faith and worship prescribes must not only be strenuously resisted, but the seducer punished by the law of the land. This is exemplified in three cases of enticement to idolatry.<p>a prophet&#8212;that is, some notable person laying claim to the character and authority of the prophetic office (Nu 12:6; 1Sa 10:6), performing feats of dexterity or power in support of his pretensions, or even predicting events which occurred as he foretold; as, for instance, an eclipse which a knowledge of natural science might enable him to anticipate (or, as Caiaphas, Joh 18:14). Should the aim of such a one be to seduce the people from the worship of the true God, he is an impostor and must be put to death. No prodigy, however wonderful, no human authority, however great, should be allowed to shake their belief in the divine character and truth of a religion so solemnly taught and so awfully attested (compare Ga 1:8). The modern Jews appeal to this passage as justifying their rejection of Jesus Christ. But He possessed all the characteristics of a true prophet, and He was so far from alienating the people from God and His worship that the grand object of His ministry was to lead to a purer, more spiritual and perfect observance of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And the sign or the wonder come to pass; </span> which God may suffer for the reason after mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saying:</span> this word is to be joined with the beginning of <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deu 13:1</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If there arise among you a prophet, or dreamer of dreams, saying, </span> what there follows, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and giveth thee a sign, </span>& c., to confirm his doctrine; such transpositions are frequent. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the sign and wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee,.... The sign he promised to give, or the miracle he proposed to do, to show the reality of his mission, and the truth of his doctrine, which is performed, or seemingly performed, by legerdemain, by magic art, or by the help of the devil; which the Lord sometimes suffered for the trial of the faith and obedience of his people, and for the hardening of others in their unbelief, and which issues in their destruction; see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>, <p>saying, let us go after other gods (which thou hast not known), and let us serve them; other gods besides the one living and true God, the Creator of all things; strange gods, the idols of the people, as the Targum of Jonathan; such as they had never heard of, nor had any knowledge of, nor any benefit from, as they had of the Lord their God. Now the doctrines of these, and of their worship, are what the false prophet or dreamer is supposed to come with, and inculcate into the minds of the people; and for the confirmation of which, and in order to draw them into the reception of them, and act according to them, he proposed to give a sign or wonder. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;</span><p>(b) He shows that to which the false prophets tend.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The closing admonition is a further expansion of <a href="/deuteronomy/12-25.htm">Deuteronomy 12:25</a> (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a>). - In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>, the exhortation goes back to the beginning again, viz., to a warning against the Canaanitish idolatry (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>.). When the Lord had cut off the nations of Canaan from before the Israelites, they were to take heed that they did not get into the snare behind them, i.e., into the sin of idolatry, which had plunged the Canaanites into destruction (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). The clause "after they be destroyed from before thee" is not mere tautology, but serves to depict the danger of the snare most vividly before their eyes. The second clause, "that thou inquire not after them" (their gods), etc., explains more fully to the Israelites the danger which threatened them. This danger was so far a pressing one, that the whole of the heathen world was animated with the conviction, that to neglect the gods of a land would be sure to bring misfortune (cf. <a href="/2_kings/17-26.htm">2 Kings 17:26</a>). </body></html>
