The enticement here is supposed to come from a brother or child, who are near by nature; from a wife or friend, who are near by choice, and are to us as our souls. But it is our duty to prefer God and religion, before the nearest and dearest friends we have in the world. We must not, to please our friends, break God's law. Thou shalt not consent to him, nor go with him, not for company, or curiosity, not to gain his affections. It is a general rule, If sinners entice thee, consent thou not, Pr 1:10.

As of the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Phoenicians: <p>nigh unto thee; as the above were, being on the borders of their land: the Targum of Jonathan interprets this of the idols of the seven nations, that is, of the land of Canaan: or <p>far off from thee; as the Babylonians, Persians, and others: <p>from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; which includes all the idols in the world, worshipped by whatsoever nation, and which were forbidden; and which shows the universality of idolatry in those times, and that that is an insufficient argument in its favour. Jarchi interprets this of the sun and moon, and the host of heaven, who go from one end of the world to the other; and this seems to have been the first and most common idolatry of the Gentile world, and which were worshipped in the several deities they set up. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first case. If a prophet, or one who had dreams, should rise up to summon to the worship of other gods, with signs and wonders which came to pass, the Israelites were not to hearken to his words, but to put him to death. The introduction of &#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; &#1495;&#1500;&#1501;, "a dreamer of dreams," along with the prophet, answers the two media of divine revelation, the vision and the dream, by which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, God made known His will. With regard to the signs and wonders (mopheth, see at <a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>) with which such a prophet might seek to accredit his higher mission, it is taken for granted that they come to pass (&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;); yet for all that, the Israelites were to give no heed to such a prophet, to walk after other gods. It follows from this, that the person had not been sent by God, but as a false prophet, and that the signs and wonders which he gave were not wonders effected by God, but &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; ("lying sings and wonders," <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>); i.e., not merely seeming miracles, but miracles wrought in the power of the wicked one, Satan, the possibility and reality of which even Christ attests (<a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). - The word &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, saying, is dependent upon the principal verb of the sentence: "if a prophet rise up...saying, We will go after other gods." </body></html>
