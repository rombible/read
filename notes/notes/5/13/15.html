The crime is supposed to be committed by one of the cities of Israel. Even when they were ordered to preserve their religion by force, yet they were not allowed to bring others to it by fire and sword. Spiritual judgments under the Christian dispensation are more terrible than the execution of criminals; we have not less cause than the Israelites had, to fear the Divine wrath. Let us then fear the spiritual idolatry of covetousness, and the love of worldly pleasure; and be careful not to countenance them in our families, by our example or by the education of our children. May the Lord write his law and truth in our hearts, there set up his throne, and shed abroad his love!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In <a href="/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a> and in <a href="/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a> the word "Belial" is rendered in our translation by the adjective "wicked."
