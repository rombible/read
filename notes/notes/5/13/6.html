A brother by mother's side, which is generally supposed to be the nearest relation, at least most out of question, so more liable to be regarded as being beloved: <p>or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom; most dearly beloved by him, as indeed each of these relations are by a man, there being none nearer or dearer to him: <p>or thy friend, which is as thine own soul; as dear to him as himself, and so strictly united in friendship, as if one soul dwelt in two bodies; such close friends were Jonathan and David, <a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1</a>. Some Jewish writers think the father is not mentioned, because of the reverence of him, with which all later dealings with him obliged to would seem inconsistent; but the reverence of God is to be preferred to the reverence of parents; and besides, if such near relations that are here mentioned, than which there are none nearer, are not to be spared if guilty of the sin after warned against, then not a father, who is in the same transgression: <p>entice thee secretly; when alone with him, which might be judged the most proper time to work upon him, there being none to oppose the enticer, or to assist the enticed; so Satan took the opportunity of Eve being alone when he attacked her with his temptation, and the same method is taken by his children: <p>saying, let me go and serve other gods which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers; not even their immediate ancestors, and so the calf was not of these gods; nor their more remote ancestors, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were no idolaters; nor even Terah, though he was one, yet the gods of the Canaanites and of the neighbouring nations, which seem to be here meant, at least principally, were such that he knew not. This circumstance may seem to carry in it an argument rather why they should not than why they should serve such gods; wherefore the words of the enticer seem to be only these: <p>let us go and serve other gods, and what follows are the words of the Lord, descriptive of those gods, and so a dissuasive from serving them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which <i>is</i> as thine own <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;</span><p>(e) All natural affection must give place to God's honour.<p>(f) Whom you love as your life.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>6–11 (7–12 in Heb.).

Not only was this to be resisted, but no consideration of affection or bend of friendship was to be allowed to interfere with the stern sentence which doomed the tempter to death; on the contrary, the person tempted was to be the first to lay hands on the tempter and put him to death. This was to be done by stoning, and the person he had tried to seduce was to cast the first stone. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy brother, the son of thy mother</span>; thy full brother, allied to thee by the closest fraternal tie. The wife of thy Bosom; the object of thy tenderest affection, Whom it is thine to protect and cherish (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54, 56</a>; <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy friend, which is as thine own soul</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. whom thou lovest as thyself. The word translated "friend" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span>, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;</span>) is from a verb which signifies to delight in, and conveys primarily the idea not merely of a companion, but of a friend in whom one delights; and the definition of true friendship is the loving another as one's self (Aristot., 'Eth. Nic.,' 9:5). As commonly used, however, the word designates any one with whom one has any dealing or intercourse; and so our Lord expounds it (<a href="/luke/10-29.htm">Luke 10:29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Secretly</span>.  If the temptation was in private, and so known only to thyself. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The admonition to observe the whole law, without adding to it or taking from it (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>), is regarded by many commentators as the conclusion of the previous chapter. But it is more correct to understand it as an intermediate link, closing what goes before, and introductory to what follows. Strictly speaking, the warning against inclining to the idolatry of the Canaanites (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>) forms a transition from the enforcement of the true mode of worshipping Jehovah to the laws relating to tempters to idolatry and worshippers of idols (ch. 13). The Israelites were to cut off not only the tempters to idolatry, but those who had been led astray to idolatry also. Three different cases are mentioned. </body></html>
