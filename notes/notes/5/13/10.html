The enticement here is supposed to come from a brother or child, who are near by nature; from a wife or friend, who are near by choice, and are to us as our souls. But it is our duty to prefer God and religion, before the nearest and dearest friends we have in the world. We must not, to please our friends, break God's law. Thou shalt not consent to him, nor go with him, not for company, or curiosity, not to gain his affections. It is a general rule, If sinners entice thee, consent thou not, Pr 1:10. And we must not hinder the course of God's justice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. thou shalt surely kill him&#8212;not hastily, or in a private manner, but after trial and conviction; and his relative, as informer, was to cast the first stone (see on [126]De 17:2; [127]Ac 7:58).

It was not sufficient to answer the end of the law to cast a few stones at him, but he was to be stoned to death: <p>because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God; to compel by force of argument, or the dint of persuasion, to relinquish the profession of the true God, faith in him, and the worship of him: <p>which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; which aggravated the sin of the enticer, and would have made the sin of the enticed the more heinous had he fallen into it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>God permitted false prophets to rise up with such wonders, to try the Israelites, whether they loved Him, the Lord their God, with all their heart. (&#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; as in <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>.) &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;, whether ye are loving, i.e., faithfully maintain your love to the Lord. It is evident from this, "that however great the importance attached to signs and wonders, they were not to be regarded among the Israelites, either as the highest test, or as absolutely decisive, but that there was a certainty in Israel, which was so much the more certain and firm than any proof from miracles could be, that it might be most decidedly opposed to it" (Baumgarten). This certainty, however, was not "the knowledge of Jehovah," as B. supposes; but as Luther correctly observes, "the word of God, which had already been received, and confirmed by its own signs," and which the Israelites were to preserve and hold fast, without adding or subtracting anything. "In opposition to such a word, no prophets were to be received, although they rained signs and wonders; not even an angel from heaven, as Paul says in <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>." The command to hearken to the prophets whom the Lord would send at a future time (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>.), is not at variance with this: for even their announcements were to be judged according to the standard of the fixed word of God that had been already given; and so far as they proclaimed anything new, the fact that what they announced did not occur was to be the criterion that they had not spoken in the name of the Lord, but in that of other gods (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>), so that even there the signs and wonders of the prophets are not made the criteria of their divine mission. </body></html>
