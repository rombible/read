He gives them possession of the country of the Amorites. If we keep from what God forbids, we shall not lose by our obedience. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; and he gives it to whom he pleases; but when there is no express direction, none can plead his grant for such proceedings. Though God assured the Israelites that the land should be their own, yet they must contend with the enemy. What God gives we must endeavour to get. What a new world did Israel now come into! Much more joyful will the change be, which holy souls will experience, when they remove out of the wilderness of this world to the better country, that is, the heavenly, to the city that has foundations. Let us, by reflecting upon God's dealings with his people Israel, be led to meditate upon our years spent in vanity, through our transgressions. But happy are those whom Jesus has delivered from the wrath to come. To whom he hath given the earnest of his Spirit in their hearts. Their inheritance cannot be affected by revolutions of kingdoms, or changes in earthly possessions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Kedemoth - literally, "Easternmost parts;" the name of a town afterward assigned to the Reubenites, and given out of that tribe to the Levites.

Rise ye up &#8230; and pass over the river Arnon&#8212;At its mouth, this stream is eighty-two feet wide and four deep. It flows in a channel banked by perpendicular cliffs of sandstone. At the date of the Israelitish migration to the east of the Jordan, the whole of the fine country lying between the Arnon and the Jabbok including the mountainous tract of Gilead, had been seized by the Amorites, who, being one of the nations doomed to destruction (see De 7:2; 20:16), were utterly exterminated. Their country fell by right of conquest into the hands of the Israelites. Moses, however, considering this doom as referring solely to the Amorite possessions west of Jordan, sent a pacific message to Sihon, requesting permission to go through his territories, which lay on the east of that river. It is always customary to send messengers before to prepare the way; but the rejection of Moses' request by Sihon and his opposition to the advance of the Israelites (Nu 21:23; Jud 11:26) drew down on himself and his Amorite subjects the predicted doom on the first pitched battlefield with the Canaanites. It secured to Israel not only the possession of a fine and pastoral country, but, what was of more importance to them, a free access to the Jordan on the east.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord our God delivered him before us,....

The phrase "city of men" can hardly mean, as Rosenm&uuml;ller affirms, "men of a city;" the hypallage here would be too violent. It rather means "a peopled city," "a city inhabited by men." The word rendered "men" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) does not designate males as opposed to females, but is a designation of human beings in general (cf. <a href="/job/11-3.htm">Job 11:3</a>; <a href="/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a> [Hebrews 20:48]; 31:31; <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4</a>, "vain persons," Authorized Version, literally, <span class="accented">men of emptiness</span> or <span class="accented">of falsehood</span>, etc.).

The wish to pass through his land in a peaceable manner was quite seriously expressed; although Moses foresaw, in consequence of the divine communication, that he would reject his proposal, and meet Israel with hostilities. For Sihon's kingdom did not form part of the land of Canaan, which God had promised to the patriarchs for their descendants; and the divine foreknowledge of the hardness of Sihon no more destroyed the freedom of his will to resolve, or the freedom of his actions, than the circumstance that in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a> the unwillingness of Sihon is described as the effect of his being hardened by God Himself. The hardening was quite as much the production of human freedom and guilt, as the consequence of the divine decree; just as in the case of Pharaoh. On Kedemoth, see <a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, equivalent to "upon the way, and always upon the way," i.e., upon the high road alone, as in <a href="/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a>. On the behaviour of the Edomites towards Israel, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>, see <a href="/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10</a>. In the same way the Moabites also supplied Israel with provisions for money. This statement is not at variance with the unbrotherly conduct for which the Moabites are blamed in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>, viz., that they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water. For &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, to meet and anticipate, signifies a hospitable reception, and the offering of food and drink without reward, which is essentially different from selling for money. "In Ar" (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), as in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-18.htm">Deuteronomy 2:18</a>. The suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>) refers to the king, who is mentioned as the lord of the land, in the place of the land itself, just as in <a href="/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>.</body></html>
