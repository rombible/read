He gives them possession of the country of the Amorites. If we keep from what God forbids, we shall not lose by our obedience. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; and he gives it to whom he pleases; but when there is no express direction, none can plead his grant for such proceedings. Though God assured the Israelites that the land should be their own, yet they must contend with the enemy. What God gives we must endeavour to get. What a new world did Israel now come into! Much more joyful will the change be, which holy souls will experience, when they remove out of the wilderness of this world to the better country, that is, the heavenly, to the city that has foundations. Let us, by reflecting upon God's dealings with his people Israel, be led to meditate upon our years spent in vanity, through our transgressions. But happy are those whom Jesus has delivered from the wrath to come. To whom he hath given the earnest of his Spirit in their hearts. Their inheritance cannot be affected by revolutions of kingdoms, or changes in earthly possessions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon - Aroer stood on the north bank of the river, and was assigned <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a> to the tribe of Reuben, of which it formed the most southerly city. The valley of the Arnon is here deep, and the descent to it abrupt. In Roman times it was spanned by a viaduct, the ruins of which still remain, and which was probably built on the lines of the original structure of Mesha <a href="/2_kings/3-5.htm">2 Kings 3:5</a>. Aroer here must not be confounded with "Aroer, which is before Rabbah" <a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>. This latter place was "built," "i. e." rebuilt, by the Gadites <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>; it belonged to that tribe, and was consequently far to the north of the Arnon. A third Aroer in the tribe of Judah is mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/30-28.htm">1 Samuel 30:28</a>.<p>"The city that is by the river," literally, "in the midst of the river" (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>) is Ar Moab (compare <a href="/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-36. Rise ye up &#8230; and pass over the river Arnon&#8212;At its mouth, this stream is eighty-two feet wide and four deep. It flows in a channel banked by perpendicular cliffs of sandstone. At the date of the Israelitish migration to the east of the Jordan, the whole of the fine country lying between the Arnon and the Jabbok including the mountainous tract of Gilead, had been seized by the Amorites, who, being one of the nations doomed to destruction (see De 7:2; 20:16), were utterly exterminated. Their country fell by right of conquest into the hands of the Israelites. Moses, however, considering this doom as referring solely to the Amorite possessions west of Jordan, sent a pacific message to Sihon, requesting permission to go through his territories, which lay on the east of that river. It is always customary to send messengers before to prepare the way; but the rejection of Moses' request by Sihon and his opposition to the advance of the Israelites (Nu 21:23; Jud 11:26) drew down on himself and his Amorite subjects the predicted doom on the first pitched battlefield with the Canaanites. It secured to Israel not only the possession of a fine and pastoral country, but, what was of more importance to them, a free access to the Jordan on the east.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the river Jabbok, </span> i.e. beyond <span class="ital">Jabbok</span>; for that was the border of the Ammonites, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm" title="Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelled in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;">Joshua 12:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> <span class="ital">Half the land of the Ammonites is</span> said to be <span class="ital">given to the tribe of Gad</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/13-25.htm" title="And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;">Joshua 13:25</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> This is true of that half of it which the Amorites had taken from them, but not of the other half, which yet was in the possession of the Ammonites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the mountains; </span> the mountainous country of the Ammonites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Forbad us, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">commanded us</span>: <span class="ital">commanding</span> is put for <span class="ital">forbidding</span> here, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/2-16.htm" title="And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:">Genesis 2:16</a> 3:11 <a href="/leviticus/4-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:">Leviticus 4:2</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/4-23.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you.">Deu 4:23</a></span>.
