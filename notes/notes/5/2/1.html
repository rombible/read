God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief, but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching them to mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance and enlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to be placed alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hast an all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use it cheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence, never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to be applied to the experience of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Deuteronomy 2:1</a> seems to refer in general terms to the long years of wandering, the details of which were not for Moses' present purpose.

Within the interval they went northward a second time to Kadesh, but being refused a passage through Edom and opposed by the Canaanites and Amalekites, they again had no alternative but to traverse once more the great Arabah southwards to the Red Sea, where turning to the left and crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (Nu 21:4, 5), they issued into the great and elevated plains, which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims in their way to Mecca. They appear to have followed northward nearly the same route, which is now taken by the Syrian hadji, along the western skirts of this great desert, near the mountains of Edom [Robinson].

At this point the language of address is exchanged for that of narrative. The change of subject from "ye abode" to "we turned," became necessary when Moses passed from exhorting and warning the people to narrating what happened after they resumed their journeyings; and gives no support to the notion of some recent German critics, that Moses left Kadesh with only a portion of the people, while the rest remained there, so that no entire departure of Israel from Kadesh ever took place - a notion which the whole tenor of the subsequent narrative contradicts. In obedience to the Divine command (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40</a>), the people, after tarrying for a while at Kadesh, took their departure and marched in the direction of the Yam-suph (<a href="/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we compassed mount Seir many days.</span> These "many days" are the thirty-eight years during which the people wandered in the wilderness before they camped the second time at Kadesh; their going round Mount Seir, which was in Edom (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8, 9, 20</a>), is descriptive of their nomadic wanderings in various directions, west, south, and south-east of that mountain (<a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>). "Crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (<a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4, 5</a>), the Israelites issued into the great and elevated plains which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims on their way to Mecca; and appear to have followed <span class="accented">northward</span> nearly the same route which is now taken by the Syrian Hadgi along the western skirts of this great desert near the mountains of Edom" (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:253, 559). Mount Seir is now <span class="accented">Jebal</span> and <span class="accented">esh-Sherah</span>. This mountain range is a continuation of that which surrounds the eastern side of the Dead Sea. The details of this protracted wandering are passed over by Moses as not required by his purpose here. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Who standeth before thee," equivalent to "in thy service" (<a href="/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a> : for this meaning, see <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28</a>).

Joshua would divide the land among the Israelites for an inheritance, viz., (v. 39) among the young Israelites, the children of the condemned generation, whom Moses, when making a further communication of the judicial sentence of God (<a href="/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>), had described as having no share in the sins of their parents, by adding, "who know not to-day what is good and evil." This expression is used to denote a condition of spiritual infancy and moral responsibility (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15-16</a>). It is different in <a href="/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40-45</a> he proceeds to describe still further, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm">Numbers 14:39-45</a>, how the people, by resisting the command of God to go back into the desert (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, compared with <a href="/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>), had simply brought still greater calamities upon themselves, and had had to atone for the presumptuous attempt to force a way into Canaan, in opposition to the express will of the Lord, by enduring a miserable defeat. Instead of "they acted presumptuously to go up" (<a href="/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), Moses says here, in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, "ye acted frivolously to go up;" and in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>, "ye acted rashly, and went up." &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491; from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to boil, or boil over (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>), signifies to act thoughtlessly, haughtily, or rashly.
