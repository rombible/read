God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief, but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching them to mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance and enlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to be placed alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hast an all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use it cheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence, never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to be applied to the experience of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have given mount Seir to Esau - Though the descendants of Esau were conquered by David <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>, yet they were not dispossessed of their land, and in the reign of Jehoshaphat they regained their independence <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. Meddle not with them&#8212;that is, "which dwell in Seir" (De 2:4)&#8212;for there was another branch of Esau's posterity, namely, the Amalekites, who were to be fought against and destroyed (Ge 36:12; Ex 17:14; De 25:17). But the people of Edom were not to be injured, either in their persons or property. And although the approach of so vast a nomadic horde as the Israelites naturally created apprehension, they were to take no advantage of the prevailing terror to compel the Edomites to accept whatever terms they imposed. They were merely to pass "through" or along their border, and to buy meat and water of them for money (De 2:6). The people, kinder than their king, did sell them bread, meat, fruits, and water in their passage along their border (De 2:29), in the same manner as the Syrian caravan of Mecca is now supplied by the people of the same mountains, who meet the pilgrims as at a fair or market on the hadji route [Robinson]. Although the Israelites still enjoyed a daily supply of the manna, there was no prohibition against their eating other food when opportunity afforded. Only they were not to cherish an inordinate desire for it. Water is a scarce commodity and is often paid for by travellers in those parts. It was the more incumbent on the Israelites to do so, as, by the blessing of God, they possessed plenty of means to purchase, and the long-continued experience of the extraordinary goodness of God to them, should inspire such confidence in Him as would suppress the smallest thought of resorting to fraud or violence in supplying their wants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Buy meat of them; </span> for though the manna did yet rain upon them, they were not forbidden to buy other meats when they had opportunity, but only were forbidden greedily to hunger after them when they could not obtain them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Buy water of them; </span> for water in those parts was scarce, and therefore private persons did severally dig pits for their particular use.

The same writer observes, that some read the words with an interrogation, "shall ye buy meat?" no, there is no need of it; for the Lord had blessed them with a sufficiency of it: <p>and ye shall also buy water of them for money; that ye may drink; which was usual in those hot countries; See Gill on <a href="/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a> or dig water (y) that is, pay for digging of wells for water, or buy water out of wells dug in the land of Edom.

To-day nomad Arabs, who winter in the warm ‘Arabah, seek to cross Mt Se‘îr with their cattle by one or other of several passes to summer pastures on the E. plateau and the wilderness of Moab. The passes are easily defended by the peasants of the Mt, who seek to prevent them; yet they are glad when the nomads travel on the edge of the desert, for then they can barter with them (Musil, <span class="ital">Edom</span>, ii. 15). Where there are no brooks but only cisterns or easily guarded springs, the peasant possessors of these will refuse to sell even small draughts to one or two passing travellers, as the writer has more than once experienced; cp. Musil, <span class="ital">Moab</span>, 132. It is conceivable how water would be still more jealously guarded from a large caravan or host, with appetites sufficient to exhaust the cisterns. It is implied in <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/2-29.htm" title="(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.">Deuteronomy 2:29</a></span> that Edom agreed to supply food and water.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then ye returned and wept before Jehovah," i.e., before the sanctuary; "but Jehovah did not hearken to your voice." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not refer to the return to Kadesh, but to an inward turning, not indeed true conversion to repentance, but simply the giving up of their rash enterprise, which they had undertaken in opposition to the commandment of God-the return from a defiant attitude to unbelieving complaining on account of the misfortune that had come upon them. Such complaining God never hears. "And ye sat (remained) in Kadesh many days, that ye remained," i.e., not "as many days as ye had been there already before the return of the spies," or "as long as ye remained in all the other stations together, viz., the half of thirty-eight years" (as Seder Olam and many of the Rabbins interpret); but "just as long as ye did remain there," as we may see from a comparison of <a href="/deuteronomy/9-25.htm">Deuteronomy 9:25</a>. It seemed superfluous to mention more precisely the time they spent in Kadesh, because that was well known to the people, whom Moses was addressing. He therefore contented himself with fixing it by simply referring to its duration, which was known to them all. It is no doubt impossible for us to determine the time they remained in Kadesh, because the expression "many days" is imply a relative one, and may signify many years, just as well as many months or weeks. But it by no means warrants the assumption of Fires and others, that no absolute departure of the whole of the people from Kadesh ever took place. Such an assumption is at variance with <a href="/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>. The change of subjects, "ye sat," etc. (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-46.htm">Deuteronomy 1:46</a>), and "we turned and removed" (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>), by no means proves that Moses only went away with that part of the congregation which attached itself to him, whilst the other portion, which was most thoroughly estranged from him, or rather from the Lord, remained there still. The change of subject is rather to be explained from the fact that Moses was passing from the consideration of the events in Kadesh, which he held up before the people as a warning, to a description of the further guidance of Israel. The reference to those events had led him involuntarily, from <a href="/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22</a> onwards, to distinguish between himself and the people, and to address his words to them for the purpose of bringing out their rebellion against God. And now that he had finished with this, he returned to the communicative mode of address with which he set out in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6</a>, but which he had suspended again until <a href="/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>. </body></html>
