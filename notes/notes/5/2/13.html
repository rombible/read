Moses also gives an instance older than any of these; the Caphtorims drove the Avims out of their country. These revolutions show what uncertain things wordly possessions are. It was so of old, and ever will be so. Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families that increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This is recorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of God has done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promise do it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddle with Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged. God gives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men; these are not the best things, he has better in store for his own children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words, "said I," are not in the Hebrew.

Ar, called in later times Rabbah, was the capital of Moab and situated twenty-five miles south of the Arnon on the banks of a small but shady stream, the Beni Hamed.

On the Mâdabâ Mosaic map (5th century) a wâdy flowing to the Dead Sea, S. of Kerak, bears the letters -<span class="greekheb">ΑΡΕΔ</span>, according to some, but if this reading be correct it maybe no more than a conjecture. The theory that the Zered was the W. el-Ḥsa is impossible; as we have seen, Israel was already N. of that S. frontier of Mo’ab. Equally impossible is the view substituted for this by most commentaries, that it was an upper stretch of the W. Kerak; for Brünnow and Musil have shown that the W. Kerak runs up E. but a short distance from Kerak. N. of the W. el-Ḥsa the Hajj road crosses the W. es-Sulṭanî, the great S. affluent of the Môjeb or Arnon, and proper frontier between the fertile land of Mo’ab and the E. desert. The W. es-Sulṭanî forms a distinct landmark on this route, and, because of the water always to be found by digging in its bed, is a suitable camping-place. So Musil, <span class="ital">Moab</span>, 316, 319 <span class="ital">n</span>., 15. But if this be the Zered, Israel crossed it not, as Musil implies, from E. to W.—for in that case they would have had to bend E. again to his probable site for ‘Ar at Medeyyneh (see <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a></span>), or cross the difficult lower stretches of the Arnon—but from S.W. to N.E. as the Hajj road does now.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - Ver. 13 connects with ver. 9, the intermediate verses being a parenthesis, introduced for the purpose of reminding the Israelites that the Edomites and Moabites had received their territory by gift from God, the earlier inhabitants having been cast out by him that they might take their lands (see vers. 21-23). There is no need, therefore, for the insertion "I said," in ver. 13; the words are those of Jehovah, not of Moses. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The brook Zered</span>; either the stream of the Wady cf.

This brook formed the boundary line between Edom and Moab, and was the limit of Israel's wanderings in the wilderness. They crossed it thirty-eight years after the doom had been pronounced upon them at Kadesh, and during that period the entire generation of those who had rebelled had died out. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And this they were able to do, because the Lord had blessed them in all the work of their hand, i.e., not merely in the rearing of flocks and herds, which they had carried on in the desert (<a href="/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>.), but in all that they did for a living; whether, for example, when stopping for a long time in the same place of encampment, they sowed in suitable spots and reaped, or whether they sold the produce of their toil and skill to the Arabs of the desert.
