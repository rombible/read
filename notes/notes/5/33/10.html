The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who said unto his father and to his mother - Compare <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>; <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-10. of Levi he said&#8212;The burden of this blessing is the appointment of the Levites to the dignified and sacred office of the priesthood (Le 10:11; De 22:8; 17:8-11), a reward for their zeal in supporting the cause of God, and their unsparing severity in chastising even their nearest and dearest relatives who had participated in the idolatry of the molten calf (Ex 32:25-28; compare Mal 2:4-6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They, </span> i.e. the priests and Levites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before thee, </span> i.e. upon thine altar of incense, which stood before the ark, the place of God’s special presence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They shall teach Jacob thy statutes, and Israel thy law,....

At Ta‘anach Sellin unearthed an incense altar which he dates about 700 b.c. (<span class="ital">Tell Ta‘annek</span>, 75 ff., 109 f.) and at Gezer Macalister found another in rubbish of 1000–600 b.c.

This seems to have been the primitive idea of the process, and a trace of it survives here in the anthropomorphic phrase <span class="bld">in thy nostrils</span> (R.V. marg.), cp. <a href="/genesis/8-21.htm" title="And the LORD smelled a sweet smell; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.">Genesis 8:21</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/26-19.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.

No sacrament could be more adequate than this, which proved at once the death deserved by the guilty, the blackness and bitterness of their sin, and its disappearance in the infinite purity of the skies, the unfathomable mercy of Heaven. It is this piacular meaning which is behind the LXX rendering <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὀργῇ σον</span>, ‘in thy wrath,’ for in <span class="ital">thy nostrils</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whole burnt offering</span>] See <a href="/deuteronomy/13-16.htm" title="And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the middle of the street thereof, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD your God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.">Deuteronomy 13:16</a> (17).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Moses appointed us a law, a possession of the congregation of Jacob. And He became King in righteous-nation (Jeshurun); there the heads of the people assembled, in crowds the tribes of Israel." The God who met Israel at Sinai in terrible majesty, out of the myriads of holy angels, who embraces all nations in love, and has all the holy angels in His power, so that they lie at His feet and rise up at His word, gave the law through Moses to the congregation of Jacob as a precious possession, and became King in Israel. This was the object of the glorious manifestation of His holy majesty upon Sinai. Instead of saying, "He gave the law to the tribes of Israel through my mediation," Moses personates the listening nation, and not only speaks of himself in the third person, but does so by identifying his own person with the nation, because he wished the people to repeat his words from thorough conviction, and because the law which he gave in the name of the Lord was given to himself as well, and was as binding upon him as upon every other member of the congregation. In a similar manner the prophet Habakkuk identifies himself with the nation in ch. 3, and says in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>, out of the heart of the nation, "The Lord is my strength,...who maketh me to walk upon mine high places," - an expression which did not apply to himself, but to the nation as a whole. So again in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1-9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/21-1.htm">Psalm 21:1-13</a>, which David composed as the prayers of the nation for its king, he not only speaks of himself as the anointed of the Lord, but addresses such prayers to the Lord for himself as could only be offered by the nation for its king. "A possession for the congregation of Jacob." "Israel was distinguished above all other nations by the possession of the divinely revealed law (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5-8</a>); that was its most glorious possession, and therefore is called its true &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;" (Knobel). The subject in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a> is not Moses but Jehovah, who became King in Jeshurun (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a>). "Were gathered together;" this refers to the assembling of the nation around Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>.; cf. <a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>.), to the day of assembly (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-16.htm">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>). </body></html>
