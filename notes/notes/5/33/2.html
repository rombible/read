His light rose from Sinai, and the tops of the hills of Seir caught its rays. The full blaze of light shone on Paran. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm" title="But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.">Psalm 1:2</a> : “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.”) He came <span class= "ital">with </span>ten thousands of saints is a mere mistranslation. The preposition is “from,” not “with.” If the verb “he came,” in the fourth line, is taken to refer to God, we must translate: “He came from ten thousands of saints” (to sinful men). Rashi takes “from” to mean “part of.” “There came some of His ten thousands of saints, but not all of them.” I believe the true translation is what I have given. The law itself was “ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator” (<a href="/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>). It is called “the word spoken by angels” in <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>. The language of <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm" title="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.">Daniel 7:10</a>—“A <span class= "ital">fiery </span>stream issued and <span class= "ital">came forth from before Him: thousand thousands ministered unto Him”</span>—supplies a complete parallel. The fiery law came from the ten thousands on “His right hand;” or <span class= "ital">from </span>them, and <span class= "ital">from </span>His right hand. This construction is by far the most simple, and agrees with what we read elsewhere.<p><span class= "bld">ADDITIONAL NOTE ON</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>. “<span class= "bld">A FIERY LAW</span>.”<p>THE original expression, <span class= "ital">eshdath </span>or <span class= "ital">esh dath, </span>sometimes written as one word, and sometimes as two, has created some difficulty. <span class= "ital">Esh </span>is “fire,” and <span class= "ital">dath, </span>if taken as a distinct word, is “law.” But <span class= "ital">dath </span>does not appear elsewhere in the <span class= "ital">Hebrew </span>of the Old Testament, until we meet it in the book of Esther, where it occurs frequently. It is also found in <a href="/ezra/8-36.htm" title="And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.">Ezra 8:36</a>. In the <span class= "ital">Chaldee </span>of Daniel and Ezra it occurs six times. Modern authorities assert that it is properly a Persian word. But since it is found in the Chaldee of Daniel, it was in use among the Chaldæans before the Persian empire. The word has Semitic affinities. The Hebrewsyllable <span class= "ital">thêth </span>would have nearly the same meaning. A <span class= "ital">datum </span>(or <span class= "ital">dictum</span>) is the nearest equivalent that we have. There seems no reason to doubt that the word <span class= "ital">dath </span>had obtained a place both in Chaldee and in Hebrew at the time of the Captivity. It is perfectly <span class= "ital">possible </span>that its existence in Chaldee dates very much earlier. We must remember that Chaldee was the language of the family of Abraham before they adopted Hebrew. “A <span class= "ital">Syrian </span>ready to perish was my father,” is the confession dictated by Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>. Syriac and Chaldee in the Old Testament are names of the same language. In the Babylonish captivity the Jews really returned to their ancestral language. It is therefore quite conceivable that Chaldæan words lingered among them until the Exodus; and this word <span class= "ital">dath, </span>if it be a true Chaldæan word, may be an example. But, obviously, these Chaldæan reminiscences would be fewer as the years rolled on. The three Targums all take <span class= "ital">dath </span>to be “law” in this place. The LXX. has “angels” (<span class= "greekheb">ἄγγελοι</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>instead of the combination <span class= "ital">eshdath. </span>Possibly the word was taken as <span class= "ital">ashdoth </span>(plural of the Chaldee <span class= "ital">ashda</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>meaning “rays” (of light?) and so “angels.” Comp., “He maketh His angels spirits, and <span class= "ital">His ministers a flame of fire</span>;” they “ran and returned as a flash of lightning” (<a href="/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-14.htm" title="And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.">Ezekiel 1:14</a>). It is also possible that the LXX. read r instead of <span class= "ital">d </span>in the word which they had before them, and that they arrived at the meaning “angels” through the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">shârath, </span>“to minister.” The confusion between <span class= "ital">r </span>and <span class= "ital">d, </span>which are extremely alike in Hebrew, is very common. The parallels referred to in the notes on the verse show that “fiery law” will yield a good sense. The only question is whether <span class= "ital">dath, </span>“law,” can be reasonably supposed to have occurred in the Mosaic writings. If the word were at all generally known at that period, to whatever language it properly belonged, it would hardly have escaped such a man as Moses. I think it quite possible that the common translation may be right. The Hebrew commentators accept it. The only alternative I can suggest is that of the LXX., which cannot be verified with certainty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord came — </span>Namely, to the Israelites; manifested himself graciously and gloriously among them.

The Holy Spirit came down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law.

The Lord came&#8212;Under a beautiful metaphor, borrowed from the dawn and progressive splendor of the sun, the Majesty of God is sublimely described as a divine light which appeared in Sinai and scattered its beams on all the adjoining region in directing Israel's march to Canaan. In these descriptions of a theophania, God is represented as coming from the south, and the allusion is in general to the thunderings and lightnings of Sinai; but other mountains in the same direction are mentioned with it. The location of Seir was on the east of the Ghor; mount Paran was either the chain on the west of the Ghor, or rather the mountains on the southern border of the desert towards the peninsula [Robinson]. (Compare Jud 5:4, 5; Ps 68:7, 8; Hab 3:3).<p>ten thousands of saints&#8212;rendered by some, "with the ten thousand of Kadesh," or perhaps better still, "from Meribah" [Ewald].<p>a fiery law&#8212;so called both because of the thunder and lightning which accompanied its promulgation (Ex 19:16-18; De 4:11), and the fierce, unrelenting curse denounced against the violation of its precepts (2Co 3:7-9). Notwithstanding those awe-inspiring symbols of Majesty that were displayed on Sinai, the law was really given in kindness and love (De 33:3), as a means of promoting both the temporal and eternal welfare of the people. And it was "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob," not only from the hereditary obligation under which that people were laid to observe it, but from its being the grand distinction, the peculiar privilege of the nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Lord came, </span> to wit, to the Israelites, i.e. manifested graciously and gloriously among them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From Sinai, </span> i.e. beginning at Sinai, where the first and most glorious appearance of God was, and so going on with them to Seir and Paran.

there he first appeared to Moses, and sent him to Egypt, and wrought miracles by him, and delivered his people Israel from thence, and when they were come to this mount he came down on it, as Aben Ezra, from Gaon, or he came "to" it; so to Zion, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>, is "out of" or "from Zion", <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>; here he appeared and gave the law, and from thence went with Israel through the wilderness, and conducted them to the land of Canaan: <p>and rose up from Seir unto them: not to the Edomites which inhabited Seir, as say Jarchi, and the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem, but to the Israelites when they compassed the land of Edom; and the Lord was with them, and gave them some signal proofs of his power and providence, kindness and goodness, to them; particularly, as some observe, by appointing a brazen serpent to be erected for the cure those bitten by fiery ones, which was a type of the glorious Redeemer and Saviour, and this was done on the borders of Edom, see <a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>; for the words here denote some illustrious appearance of the Lord, like that of the rising sun; so the Targum of Onkelos,"the brightness of his glory from Seir was shown unto us;''and that of Jonathan,"and the brightness of the glory of his Shechinah went from Gebal:" <p>he shined forth from Mount Paran: in which the metaphor of the sun rising is continued, and as expressive of its increasing light and splendour: near to this mount was a wilderness of the same name, through which the children of Israel travelled, and where the Lord appeared to them: here the cloud rested when they removed from Sinai; here, or near it, the Spirit of the Lord was given to the seventy elders, and from hence the spies were sent into the land of Canaan, <a href="/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; in this wilderness Ishmael and his posterity dwelt, <a href="/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a>;

beside, in a literal sense, as these mountains were very near one another, as Saadiah Gaon observes, the great light which shone on Mount Sinai, when the Lord descended on it, might extend to the other mountains and illuminate them, see <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>, <p>and he came with ten thousands of saints: or holy angels, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, and so Jarchi;

see <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; the appearance of those holy spirits in such great numbers added to the grandeur and solemnity of the giving of the holy law to the people of Israel, as the attendance of the same on Christ at his second coming will add to the lustre and glory of it, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/9-26.htm">Luke 9:26</a>, <p>from his right hand went a fiery law for them: the Israelites;

and the meaning of the last words, "a law for them", a law which stands or abides continually; and so the Septuagint version is,"at his right hand angels with him:''no doubt that law is meant which came from God on Mount Sinai, by the ministration of angels, into the hand of Moses; called a fiery law, because it was given out of the midst of the fire, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>; so the Targum of Onkelos, <p>"the writing of his right hand out of the midst of fire, the law he gave unto us;''and because of its effects on the consciences of men, where it pierces and penetrates like fire, and works a sense of wrath and fiery indignation in them, by reason of the transgressions of it, it being the ministration of condemnation and death on that account; and, because of its use, it serves as a lantern to the feet, and a light to the path of good men: this law may include the judicial and ceremonial laws given at this time; but it chiefly respects the moral law, and which may be said to come from God, who, as Creator, has a right to be Governor of his creature, and to enact what laws he pleases, and from his right hand, in allusion to men's writing with their right hand, this being written by the finger of God;

"from his celestial seat, where myriads of angels surround his throne" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The rendering "with," though that of the Targum, LXX., and Vulgate, cannot be retained; nor does Scripture represent God as attended by angels when he comes forth to manifest his glory to men. They are represented as surrounding his throne in heaven (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>), as his servants awaiting his behest, and his host that do his pleasure (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2, 3</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>); and God is represented as dwelling in the midst of them (<a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>). Hence he is represented here as coming forth from among them to manifest himself to his people. <span class="cmt_word">A fiery law</span>. There is a various reading here; instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, fire of law, many codices have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> in one word, and this is supported by the Samaritan text and other authorities, and is accepted by most critics and interpreters. It is a fatal objection to the textual reading that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> is not a Semitic word, but one of Persian origin, brought by the Jews from Babylonia, and found only in the post-exilian books (<a href="/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8, 19</a>; <a href="/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8, 12</a>; <a href="/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8, 14</a>; <a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11, 15</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12, 21</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9, 13, 15</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5, 9, 13, 16</a>); and in them as applied to the Law of God only by heathens. It is, therefore, altogether improbable that this word should be found in any Hebrew writing anterior to the Captivity. Besides, what is the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, supposing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> to mean "law?" The words cannot be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, by "fiery law;" they can only be rendered by "a fire, a law," or "a fire of law," and What either of these may mean it is not easy to see. The ancient versions vary here very considerably: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">fin dextera ejus ignea lex</span>; Targum of Onkelos, "Written by his right hand, from the midst of the fire, a law gave he to us;" Syriac, "With myriads of his saints at his right hand. He gave to them, and also caused all peoples to love them." The best Hebrew manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> as one word. The Masoretic note is, "The <span class="accented">Chatiph is</span> one word, and the <span class="accented">K'ri</span> two." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> is best explained as a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span>, an Aramaic word signifying to throw or dart; the Syriac , or the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, having the same signification, so that the meaning is "fire-dartings:" from his right hand went rays of fire like arrows shot forth (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Israelites, to whom this manifestation was vouchsafed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"That self-same day," viz., the day upon which Moses had rehearsed the song to the children of Israel, the Lord renewed the announcement of his death, by repeating the command already given to him (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12-14</a>) to ascend Mount Nebo, there to survey the land of Canaan, and then to be gathered unto his people.
