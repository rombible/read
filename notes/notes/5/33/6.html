The LXX. insert Simeon, “let Simeon be many in number.” But there is no need for this. The most terrible destruction ever wrought in Israel by the word of Moses came on Dathan and Abiram (who were Reubenites), when “they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit.” We cannot say how far the tribe was diminished by this terrible visitation and the plague that followed (<span class= "ital">Numbers 16</span>), but the fighting men of the tribe had slightly decreased in the second census (<a href="/numbers/1-21.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 1:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-7.htm" title="These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty.">Numbers 26:7</a>), and only two of all the twelve tribes had a smaller force than Reuben<p>at this time. It seems best, therefore, to take the whole verse as applying to Reuben, and the negative in the first clause as covering the second clause also. “Let not his men be a (small) number.” The omission of Simeon may be accounted for by his coming <span class= "ital">within the inheritance of Judah, </span>in Canaan, and enjoying the blessing and protection of that most distinguished tribe. Rashi also takes this view.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/33-6.htm" title="Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.">Deuteronomy 33:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let Reuben live, and not die — </span>Though Reuben deserve to be cut off, or greatly diminished and obscured, according to Jacob’s prediction, (<a href="/genesis/49-4.htm" title="Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed; then defiled you it: he went up to my couch.">Genesis 49:4</a>,) yet God will spare them, and give them a name and portion among the tribes of Israel. All the ancient paraphrasts refer this to the other world, so far were they from expecting temporal blessings only. “Let Reuben live in life eternal,” says Onkelos, “and not die the second death.” “Let Reuben live in this world,” so Jonathan and the Jerusalem Targum, “and not die that death which the wicked die in the world to come.” <span class="ital">Let not his men be few — </span>As the word <span class="ital">not </span>is wanting in the Hebrew, we may render the clause more properly, <span class="ital">Though his men be few. </span>This best agrees with Jacob’s prophecy, (<a href="/genesis/49-4.htm" title="Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed; then defiled you it: he went up to my couch.">Genesis 49:4</a>,) that he should <span class="ital">not excel, </span>and yet <span class="ital">live, </span>that is, should still subsist, and be in some measure a flourishing tribe, though less numerous than some others.

Here is no mention of Simeon; but this tribe is thought by some to be included in the blessing of Reuben, to whom Simeon was next in birth, and who stood most in need of the same blessing, for no tribe was more impaired in the wilderness than Simeon’s. See on <a href="/numbers/26-14.htm" title="These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 26:14</a>.

The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let not his men be few - literally, "a number," i. e., "a small number," such as could be easily counted (compare <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a> note). While the verse promises that the tribe shall endure and prosper, yet it is so worded as to carry with it a warning. The Reubenites, occupied with their herds and flocks, appear, soon after the days of Joshua, to have lost their early energy, until in later times its numbers, even when counted with the Gadites and the half of Manasseh, were fewer than that of the Reubenites alone at the census of <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> (Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a> with <a href="/numbers/1-20.htm">Numbers 1:20</a>.) No judge, prophet, or national hero arose out of this tribe.<p>The tribe of Simeon, which would according to the order of birth come next, is not here named. This omission is explained by reference to the words of Jacob concerning Simeon <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>. This tribe with Levi was to he "scattered in Israel." The fulfillment of this prediction was in the case of Levi so ordered as to carry with it honor and blessing; but no such reversal of punishment was granted to Simeon. Rather had this latter tribe added new sins to those which Jacob denounced (compare <a href="/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5</a> note). Accordingly, though very numerous at the Exodus, it had surprisingly diminished before the death of Moses (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-22.htm">Numbers 1:22-23</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-12.htm">Numbers 26:12-14</a>); and eventually it found territory adequate for its wants within the limits of another tribe, Judah.

Let Reuben live, and not die&#8212;Although deprived of the honor and privileges of primogeniture, he was still to hold rank as one of the tribes of Israel. He was more numerous than several other tribes (Nu 1:21; 2:11). Yet gradually he sank into a mere nomadic tribe, which had enough to do merely "to live and not die." Many eminent biblical scholars, resting on the most ancient and approved manuscripts of the Septuagint, consider the latter clause as referring to Simeon; "and Simeon, let his men be few," a reading of the text which is in harmony with other statements of Scripture respecting this tribe (Nu 25:6-14; 1:23; 26:14; Jos 19:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though Reuben deserve to be cut off, or greatly diminished and obscured, according to Jacob’s prediction, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/49-4.htm" title="Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed; then defiled you it: he went up to my couch.">Genesis 49:4</a></span>; yet God will spare them, and give them a name and portion among the tribes of Israel, and bless them with increase of their numbers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let Reuben live, and not die,....

But their kinship was an old tradition and this law like the others of the group reflects not a political situation but a religious principle. The attitude to Egypt appears to conflict with the feeling usual in D that the Egyptians had only been the enslavers of Israel—<span class="ital">house of bondmen, fiery furnace</span>, etc. Yet D also elsewhere remembers that the poor and weak nomad, who was the father of Israel, became in Egypt a great nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>); and further the admission into Israel of the third generation of an Egyptian was apparently already allowed in the 7th cent. b.c.

The hypothesis is clever. Yet the introduction of Simeon in a few codd. of the LXX may be a later attempt to fill up the number of the 12 tribes; while on the other hand the absence of Simeon from the poem is explicable by the fortunes of the tribe; cursed in <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm" title="Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.">Genesis 49:7</a>; absorbed in Judah, <a href="/context/joshua/19-1.htm" title="And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah....">Joshua 19:1-9</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/4-24.htm" title="The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul:">1 Chronicles 4:24</a> ff., and otherwise absent from the history of Israel.

With these may be compared the blessing which Jacob pronounced on his sons as representing the tribes of which they were the heads.

Though the rights of primogeniture had been withdrawn from Reuben, and Jacob had declared that he should not excel, Moses here assures the tribe of continuance, and even prosperity. Their number was not to be small; which was, perhaps, said to comfort them, in view of the fact that their numbers had greatly diminished in the course of their wanderings in the desert (comp. <a href="/numbers/1-21.htm">Numbers 1:21</a> with Numbers 26:7). At no time, however, was this tribe numerous as compared with the others; nor was it ever distinguished either by the enterprise of its members or by the eminence of any of them in the councils of the nation or the management of affairs. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"That self-same day," viz., the day upon which Moses had rehearsed the song to the children of Israel, the Lord renewed the announcement of his death, by repeating the command already given to him (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12-14</a>) to ascend Mount Nebo, there to survey the land of Canaan, and then to be gathered unto his people.
