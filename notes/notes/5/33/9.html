To which we may add that the office of the priests and Levites, which engaged their constant attendance, at least by turns, at God’s altar, laid them under a necessity of being frequently absent from their families, which they could neither take such care of nor make such provision for, as other Israelites might. This constant self-denial they submitted to, that they might observe God’s word, and keep the covenant of priesthood. And all those, even under the gospel, who are called to minister in holy things, should remember that it is their duty to sit loose to the relations and interests which are dearest to them in this world, and prefer the fulfilling of their ministry before the gratifying the best friend they have, <a href="/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="/acts/21-13.htm" title="Then Paul answered, What mean you to weep and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.">Acts 21:13</a>.

The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who said unto his father and to his mother - Compare <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>; <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-10. of Levi he said&#8212;The burden of this blessing is the appointment of the Levites to the dignified and sacred office of the priesthood (Le 10:11; De 22:8; 17:8-11), a reward for their zeal in supporting the cause of God, and their unsparing severity in chastising even their nearest and dearest relatives who had participated in the idolatry of the molten calf (Ex 32:25-28; compare Mal 2:4-6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I have not seen him, </span> i.e. I have no respect unto them, for so <span class="ital">knowledge</span> is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/job/9-21.htm" title="Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.">Job 9:21</a> <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm" title="A righteous man regards the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.">Proverbs 12:10</a>,11 <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a></span>.

The nations or peoples are not the tribes of Israel here, any more than in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, or <a href="/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>, and <a href="/genesis/48-4.htm">Genesis 48:4</a>; whilst <a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a> and <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a> cannot come into consideration at all, for there the word is defined by a suffix. The meaning of the words depends upon whether "all His holy ones" are the godly in Israel, or the Israelites generally, or the angels. There is nothing to favour the first explanation, as the distinction between the godly and the wicked would be out of place in the introduction to a blessing upon all the tribes. The second has only as seeming support in <a href="/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>. and <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. It does not follow at once from the calling of Israel to be the holy nation of Jehovah, that all the Israelites were or could be called "holy ones of the Lord." Least of all should <a href="/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a> be adduced in support of this. Even in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a> the holy ones of the Most High are not the Jews generally, but simply the godly, or believers, in the nation of God. The third view, on the other hand, is a perfectly natural one, on account of the previous reference to the holy myriads. The meaning, therefore, would be this: The Lord embraces all nations with His love, He who, so to speak, has all His holy angels in His hand, i.e., His power, so that they serve Him as their Lord. They lie down at His feet. The &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is explained by Kimchi and Saad. as signifying adjuncti sequuntur vestigia sua; and by the Syriac, They follow thy foot, from conjecture rather than any certain etymology. The derivation proposed by modern linguists, from the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, according to an Arabic word signifying recubuit, innixus est, has apparently more to support it. &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, it rises up: intransitive, as in <a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>, and <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; is not a Hithpael participle (that which is spoken); for &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; has not a passive, but an active signification, to converse (<a href="/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>, etc.). It is rather a noun, &#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, words, utterances. The singular, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, is distributive: every one (of them) rises on account of thine utterance, i.e., at thy words. The suffixes relate to God, and the discourse passes from the third to the second person. In our own language, such a change in a sentence like this, "all His (God's) holy ones are in Thy (God's) hand," would be intolerably harsh, but in Hebrew poetry it is by no means rare (see, for example, <a href="/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a>).</body></html>
