The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dan shall be like a lion which leaps forth from his covert in Bashan.

Bashan was a mountain in which lions haunted, and from whence they might be said to leap, as they do when they seize on their prey: it may have some respect to the leap of the Danites from the northwest part of the land of Israel, where they were settled, but was not sufficient for them, to the northeast of it, when they went against Leshem, and took it, and called it Dan; see <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/33.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>22 And of Dan he said:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dan, a whelp of a lion,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He leaps from Bashán.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22</span>. The situation assigned is that northern one, to which the tribe migrated from their earlier seat in the South (<a href="/judges/18-7.htm" title="Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.">Jdg 18:7</a>). They settled at Laish (a poetical term for <span class="ital">lion</span>) or Leshem, thereafter called Dan, which is usually identified with Tell-el-Ḳadi (Ḳadi = Dan) in the valley of Jordan below Ḥermon. But because of the military weakness of this site and the impossibility of holding the valley—the main northern avenue into Palestine—except from the heights above the neighbouring Banias, on which stand the ruins of the Crusaders’ Castle, eṣ-Ṣubeibeh, the present writer has argued (<span class="ital">HGHL</span>, 473, 479 ff.) that the site of Laish or Dan must have been on these heights. This is confirmed by the present <span class="ital">v. he leaps from Bashán</span>, a name which never covers the Jordan valley where Tell-el-Ḳadi lies, but is applicable to the heights to the E. of it.—The oracle in <a href="/genesis/49-16.htm" title="Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.">Genesis 49:16</a> f. reflects this post of vantage over the entrance of invaders from the N.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - Jacob compared Dan to a serpent that suddenly springs forth by the way, and bites the heels of a horse so that the rider falls backward. Moses here compares the tribe to a young lion that suddenly leaps from its lair in Bashan on the object of its attack. Both similitudes relate to the vigor and force which the tribe should display in conflict. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joseph. - <a href="/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>. "Blessed of the Lord be his land, of (in) the most precious things of heaven, the dew, and of the flood which lies beneath, (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-14.htm">Deuteronomy 33:14</a>) and of the most precious of the produce of the sun, and of the most precious of the growth of the moons, (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>) and of the head of the mountains of olden time, and of the most precious thing of the everlasting hills, (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-16.htm">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>) and of the most precious thing of the earth, and of its fulness, and the good-will of Him that dwelt in the bush: let it come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of him that is illustrious among his brethren." What Jacob desired and solicited for his son Joseph, Moses also desires for this tribe, namely, the greatest possible abundance of earthly blessing, and a vigorous manifestation of power in conflict with the nations. But however unmistakeable may be the connection between these words and the blessing of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>.), not only in the things desired, but even in particular expression, there is an important difference which equally strikes us, namely, that in the case of Jacob the main point of the blessing is the growth of Joseph into a powerful tribe, whereas with Moses it is the development of power on the part of this tribe in the land of its inheritance, in perfect harmony with the different times at which the blessings were pronounced. Jacob described the growth of Joseph under the figure of the luxuriant branch of a fruit-tree planted by the water; whilst Moses fixes his eye primarily upon the land of Joseph, and desires for him the richest productions. "May his land be blessed by Jehovah from (&#1502;&#1503; of the cause of the blessing, whose author was Jehovah; vid., <a href="/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>) the most precious thing of the heaven." &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;, which only occurs again in the Sol 4:13, Sol 4:16, and Sol 7:13, is applied to precious fruits. The most precious fruit which the heaven yields to the land is the dew. The "productions of the sun," and &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, "the produce of the moons," are the fruits of the earth, which are matured by the influence of the sun and moon, by their light, their warmth. At the same time, we can hardly so distinguish the one from the other as to understand by the former the fruits which ripen only once a year, and by the latter those which grow several times and in difference months; and <a href="/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a> cannot be adduced as proofs of this. The plural "moons" in parallelism with the sun does not mean months, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-2.htm">Exodus 2:2</a>, but the different phases which the moon shows in its revolution round the earth. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; (from the head), in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>, is a contracted expression signifying "from the most precious things of the head." The most precious things of the head of the mountains of old and the eternal hills, are the crops and forests with which the tops of the mountains and hills are covered. Moses sums up the whole in the words, "the earth, and the fulness thereof:" everything in the form of costly good that the earth and its productions can supply. - To the blessings of the heaven and earth there are to be added the good-will of the Lord, who appeared to Moses in the thorn-bush to redeem His people out of the bondage and oppression of Egypt and bring it into the land of Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>.). The expression "that dwells in the bush" is to be explained from the significance of this manifestation of God as shown at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, which shadowed forth a permanent relation between the Lord and His people. The spiritual blessing of the covenant grace is very suitably added to the blessings of nature; and there is something no less suitable in the way in which the construction commencing with &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; is dropped, so that an anakolouthon ensues. This word cannot be taken as an accusative of more precise definition, as Schultz supposes; nor is &#1502;&#1503; to be supplied before it, as Knobel suggests. Grammatically considered, it is a nominative to which the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; properly belongs, although, as a matter of fact, not only the good-will, but the natural blessings, of the Lord were also to come upon the head of Joseph. Consequently we have not &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; (masc.), which &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; would require, but the lengthened poetical feminine form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; (vid., Ewald, 191, c.), used in a neuter sense. It, i.e., everything mentioned before, shall come upon Joseph. On the expression, "illustrious among his brethren," see at <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>. In the strength of this blessing, the tribe of Joseph would attain to such a development of power, that it would be able to tread down all nations. </body></html>
