Rashi, the Jewish commentator, thinks there were two arks: one to go out to war, and the other to remain in the tabernacle. But there is no foundation for this statement. There may, of course, have been a temporary receptacle for the tables made by Moses (like the temporary tabernacle mentioned in <a href="/exodus/33-7.htm" title="And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation.

There were four things in and by which the Lord showed himself reconciled to Israel. God gave them his law. Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments, as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward toward Canaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things. And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's work on men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work in every age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader.

On the fortieth day, mentioned in the preceding chapter, as Aben Ezra, or at the end of forty days, as Jarchi; not of the first forty, for then were given him the first two tables of stone, with the law written on them, which he broke when he came down; but at the end of the second forty days, as some think, when he had fallen before the Lord, and entreated him for the people, and, as a token of his reconciliation to them, gave the following order: <p>hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, &amp;c. Of the same sort of stone, of the same size and form with those God gave him in the mount the first time he was there, and which he broke in his descent from thence; they were the work of God, but these were to be hewed by Moses: the order seems to be given between the request Moses made to see the glory of the Lord, and the proclamation made of it, see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>, and come up unto me into the mount; Mount Sinai; this was certainly the third time of his going up there, and where he continued forty days and nights; but whether he continued there so long the second time may be a matter of question, though he certainly did the third time; see <a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30</a>. <p>and make thee an ark of wood; Jarchi thinks this was not the ark Bezaleel made, but made after, and is that which went out to battle; and some take it to be a temporary ark, made for the present purpose till that was finished; but Aben Ezra is of opinion it is the same that Bezaleel made: and it may be said to be made by Moses, because he was not only ordered to make it, but it was by his orders and the direction he gave to Bezaleel that it was made; and this seems the more probable, because there the tables remained, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-5.htm">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first</span>] So <a href="/exodus/34-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first: and I will write on these tables the words that were in the first tables, which you brake.">Exodus 34:1</a><span class="ital"> a</span>, JE.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and come up unto me into the mount</span>] So probably in the original E; J has, <span class="ital">come up in the morning unto Mt Sinai and present thyself to me</span>, etc., followed by a command to keep the Mount free of men and cattle, <a href="/context/exodus/34-2.htm" title="And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me in the top of the mount....">Exodus 34:2-3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and make thee an ark of wood</span>] Almost certainly from the original E; see general note above. <span class="ital">Ark</span> or <span class="ital">chest</span>, so in Assyr. and Arabic, cp. <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm" title="But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.">2 Kings 12:9</a> f., a chest for the temple-offerings, a money box; in Phoen. a coffin or sarcophagus, and so in <a href="/genesis/50-26.htm" title="So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.">Genesis 50:26</a>. <span class="ital">Of wood</span>, in P, <a href="/context/exodus/25-10.htm" title="And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof....">Exodus 25:10-16</a>, of acacia wood (as below in <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/10-3.htm" title="And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like to the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.">Deuteronomy 10:3</a></span>) with the dimensions 2½ x 1½ x 1½ cubits, to be overlaid, in and out, with pure gold, with a moulding and rings of gold, and staves of acacia wood likewise overlaid with gold.

Directions had been given for the construction of the ark before the apostasy of the people, and it was not made till after the tabernacle had been erected, nor were the tables placed in it till the tabernacle had been consecrated (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>, etc.; Exodus 40:20). But as the things themselves were closely connected, Moses mentions them here together, without regard to chronological order. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And it was not on this occasion only, viz., at Horeb, that Israel aroused the anger of the Lord its God by its sin, but it did so again and again at other places: at Tabeerah, by discontent at the guidance of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>); at Massah, by murmuring on account of the want of water (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>.); at the graves of lust, by longing for flesh (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>.); and at Kadesh-barnea by unbelief, of which they had already been reminded at <a href="/deuteronomy/1-26.htm">Deuteronomy 1:26</a>. The list is not arranged chronologically, but advances gradually from the smaller to the more serious forms of guilt. For Moses was seeking to sharpen the consciences of the people, and to impress upon them the fact that they had been rebellious against the Lord (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>) from the very beginning, "from the day that I knew you." </body></html>
