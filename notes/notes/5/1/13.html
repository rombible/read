He owns the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham, and prays for the further accomplishment of it. We are not straitened in the power and goodness of God; why should we be straitened in our own faith and hope? Good laws were given to the Israelites, and good men were to see to the execution of them, which showed God's goodness to them, and the care of Moses.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This appointment of the "captains" (compare <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a> ff) must not be confounded with that of the elders in <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> ff. The former would number 78,600; the latter were 70 only.<p>A comparison between this passage and that in Exodus makes it obvious that Moses is only touching on certain parts of the whole history, without regard to order of time, but with a special purpose. This important arrangement for the good government of the people took place before they left Horeb to march direct to the promised land. This fact sets more clearly before us the perverseness and ingratitude of the people, to which the orator next passes; and shows, what he was anxious to impress, that the fault of the 40 years' delay rested only with themselves! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude&#8212;This was neither an Oriental hyperbole nor a mere empty boast. Abraham was told (Ge 15:5, 6) to look to the stars, and though they "appear" innumerable, yet those seen by the naked eye amount, in reality, to no more than three thousand ten in both hemispheres. The Israelites already far exceeded that number, being at the last census above six hundred thousand [Nu 26:51].

The mount of the Amorites is the mountainous country inhabited by this tribe, the leading feature in the land of Canaan, and is synonymous with the "land of the Canaanites" which follows; the Amorites being mentioned instar omnium as being the most powerful of all the tribes in Canaan, just as in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a> (see at <a href="/genesis/10-16.htm">Genesis 10:16</a>). &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, "those who dwell by it," are the inhabitants of the whole of Canaan, as is shown by the enumeration of the different parts of the land, which follows immediately afterwards. Canaan was naturally divided, according to the character of the ground, into the Arabah, the modern Ghor (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>); the mountain, the subsequent mountains of Judah and Ephraim (see at <a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>); the lowland (shephelah), i.e., the low flat country lying between the mountains of Judah and the Mediterranean Sea, and stretching from the promontory of Carmel down to Gaza, which is intersected by only small undulations and ranges of hills, and generally includes the hill country which formed the transition from the mountains to the plain, though the two are distinguished in <a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a> and <a href="/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a> (see at <a href="/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>.); the south land (negeb: see at <a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>); and the sea-shore, i.e., the generally narrow strip of coast running along by the Mediterranean Sea from Joppa to the Tyrian ladders, or Rs el Abiad, just below Tyre (vid., v. Raumer, Pal. p. 49). - The special mention of Lebanon in connection with the land of the Canaanites, and the enumeration of the separate parts of the land, as well as the extension of the eastern frontier as far as the Euphrates (see at <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), are to be attributed to the rhetorical fulness of the style. The reference, however, is not to Antilibanus, but to Lebanon proper, which was within the northern border of the land of Israel, as fixed in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-7.htm">Numbers 34:7-9</a>.</body></html>
