He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The plan of sending the spies originated with the people; and, as in itself a reasonable one, it approved itself to Moses; it was submitted to God, sanctioned by Him, and carried out under special divine direction. The orator's purpose in this chapter is to bring before the people emphatically their own responsibilites and behavior. It is therefore important to remind them, that the sending of the spies, which led immediately to their complaining and rebellion, was their own suggestion.<p>The following verses to the end of the chapter give a condensed account, the fuller one being in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>, of the occurrences which led to the banishment of the people for 40 years into the wilderness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. the cities are great, and walled up to heaven&#8212;an Oriental metaphor, meaning very high.

The honest and uncompromising language of Moses, in reminding the Israelites of their perverse conduct and outrageous rebellion at the report of the treacherous and fainthearted scouts, affords a strong evidence of the truth of this history as well as of the divine authority of his mission. There was great reason for his dwelling on this dark passage in their history, as it was their unbelief that excluded them from the privilege of entering the promised land (Heb 3:19); and that unbelief was a marvellous exhibition of human perversity, considering the miracles which God had wrought in their favor, especially in the daily manifestations they had of His presence among them as their leader and protector.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The people is greater, </span> in number and strength and valour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Up to heaven, </span> i.e. to a great height.

The presumably pre-Israelite walls of two cities have been excavated: Lachish (Bliss, <span class="ital">A Mound of Many Cities</span>, 27 ff.) and Gezer (Macalister, <span class="ital">Bible Side Lights from … Gezer</span>, 141 ff.). Each is about 14 ft thick; the latter (a little later than 1450 b.c.) still in parts from 10 to 14 ft. high ‘can hardly be regarded as much more than the underground foundations.’ If, as is usually reckoned, the thickness was from ⅓ to ⅔ of the height this wall was from 21 to 42 ft, its impressive-ness increased by the scarps and slopes from which it rose and by the towers that crowned it. Sellin has laid bare in Jericho a ‘cyclopean’ outer stone wall 5 m. (16.4 ft), crowned by a brick wall 2 m. thick and 6 or 8 m. (19½ to 26¼ ft) high. So that <span class="ital">up to heaven</span>, the height at which birds fly, is hardly an exaggeration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Emerging from the desert, Israel were startled by two facts which still startle the tent-dwelling nomads—the walls of cities and the stature of the settled inhabitants. No Arab enters without fear a walled city for the first time, nor willingly passes the night there. Egyptian bas-reliefs and paintings distinguish the ampler figures of settled Syrians from the lean and meagre desert Arabs. To-day, as the present writer has frequently noticed, the same difference of average stature is obvious between the two classes. Cp. Burton (<span class="ital">Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Mecca</span>, ii. 83, mem. ed.) on the short stature of the Arabs of the Hiǧaz. The cause of this is the difference in nutriment (Doughty, <span class="ital">Ar. Des. passim</span>, Musil, <span class="ital">Ar. Petr.</span> iii.). That early Israel felt these two impressions is one of many indications that they belonged to the nomad or Arab type of Semite.

The O.T. associates this vanishing race of giants with the neighbourhood of Hebron and the E. of Jordan, where structures of huge stones abound, and individual giants are said to have lived in the time of David. The latter notices are perfectly credible; single giants being then as possible as they have been at all other periods. The present writer saw in the asylum at Asfuriyeh a Syrian of unusual height, who was born with six fingers on each hand like the giant in <a href="/2_samuel/21-20.htm" title="And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.">2 Samuel 21:20</a>. But the question of gigantic races in primitive ages vanishing before historic man must be judged in the light of the following. <span class="ital">First</span>, stories of such giant races are universal, e.g. among the Babylonians (Jeremias, <span class="ital">Das A. T. im Lichte des alten Orients</span>, 76, 120 f., 359), Phoenicians (Eusebius, <span class="ital">Praep. Evang.</span> i. 10 from Philo Bybl.), Greeks (the stories of Titans and Cyclopes), the nations of N. Europe, modern Arabs and Syrians (Thomson, <span class="ital">Land and Book</span>, 586 f.; Doughty, <span class="ital">Ar. Des.</span> i. 22). <span class="ital">Second</span>, many of these traditions are associated with remains of cyclopean masonry, and have obviously arisen in order to account for these, the giant races being nearly always described as builders; moreover the giants are generally derived by birth from the gods. <span class="ital">Third</span>, though stories have been current from time to time of the discovery of monstrous human skeletons and bones, e g. Plutarch, Pliny and even as late as Buffon, yet where it has been possible to test these the bones have been recognised as those of elephants, mastodons, etc.; while the discovered remains of pre-historic man show generally a stature under the average; this is also true of Mr Macalister’s finds of pre-Semitic remains in Gezer (the sole exception seems to be the average of the Cro-Magnon remains and this is only 5.839 feet). <span class="ital">Fourth</span>, the Hebrew tradition of a giant race exhibits the features already noted in such stories elsewhere: the race has disappeared, its memory is connected with cyclopean remains, it is said to have descended from the union of divine and human beings. These marks, along with the mythical names given to the race, Nephîlîm and Repha’îm, make it clear that, like its analogies among other peoples, Israel’s tradition of a primitive race of giants is borrowed from an imaginative folk-lore.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our brethren have discouraged our heart</span>; literally, <span class="accented">hate melted</span> or <span class="accented">made to flow down our heart</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, Hiph. cf <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>, to flow down or melt), <span class="accented">have made us fainthearted</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The cities are great and walled up to heaven</span>; literally, <span class="accented">are great and fortified in the heavens</span>.

The discontent of the people with the guidance of God was manifested at the very first places of encampment in the desert (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a> and 12); but Moses passed over this, and simply reminded them of the rebellion at Kadesh (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a> and 14), because it was this which was followed by the condemnation of the rebellious generation to die out in the wilderness.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19-25</a><p>"When we departed from Horeb, we passed through the great and dreadful wilderness, which ye have seen," i.e., become acquainted with, viz., the desert of et Tih, "of the way to the mountains of the Amorites, and came to Kadesh-Barnea" (see at <a href="/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, with an accusative, to pass through a country (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/50-10.htm">Isaiah 50:10</a>, etc.). Moses had there explained to the Israelites, that they had reached the mountainous country of the Amorites, which Jehovah was about to give them; that the land lay before them, and they might take possession of it without fear (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-21.htm">Deuteronomy 1:21</a>). But they proposed to send out men to survey the land, with its towns, and the way into it. Moses approved of this proposal, and sent out twelve men, one from each tribe, who went through the land, etc. (as is more fully related in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, and has been expounded in connection with that passage, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22-25</a>). Moses' summons to them to take the land (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-21.htm">Deuteronomy 1:21</a>) is not expressly mentioned there, but it is contained implicite in the fact that spies were sent out; as the only possible reason for doing this must have been, that they might force a way into the land, and take possession of it. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-25.htm">Deuteronomy 1:25</a>, Moses simply mentions so much of the report of the spies as had reference to the nature of the land, viz., that it was good, that he may place in immediate contrast with this the refusal of the people to enter in.</body></html>
