The Lord had placed this land in the power of the Israelites, had given it up to them to possess and use it, according as he had sworn to their fathers, the patriarchs, to give it to them and their seed (comp. <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc.; Genesis 22:16). At Horeb, therefore, they received the charter of their inheritance, and might have gone on at once to take possession of the land. The delay that had occurred had arisen solely from their own waywardness and perversity, not from anything on the part of God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a> also the retrospective glance at the guidance through the desert is unmistakeable. "Eleven days is the way from Horeb to the mountains of Seir as far as Kadesh-Barnea." With these words, which were unquestionably intended to be something more than a geographical notice of the distance of Horeb from Kadesh-barnea, Moses reminded the people that they had completed the journey from Horeb, the scene of the establishment of the covenant, to Kadesh, the border of the promised land, in eleven days, that he might lead them to lay to heart the events which took place at Kadesh itself. The "way of the mountains of Seir" is not the way along the side of these mountains, i.e., the way through the Arabah, which is bounded by the mountains of Seir on the east, but the way which leads to the mountains of Seir, just as in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Deuteronomy 2:1</a> the way of the Red Sea is the way that leads to this sea. From these words, therefore, it by no means follows that Kadesh-Barnea is to be sought for in the Arabah, and that Israel passed through the Arabah from Horeb to Kadesh. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>, they departed from Horeb, went through the great and terrible wilderness by the way to the mountains of the Amorites, and came to Kadesh-barnea. Hence the way to the mountains of the Amorites, i.e., the southern part of what were afterwards the mountains of Judah (see at <a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>), is the same as the way to the mountains of Seir; consequently the Seir referred to here is not the range on the eastern side of the Arabah, but Seir by Hormah (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>), i.e., the border plateau by Wady Murreh, opposite to the mountains of the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a> : see at <a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a>).</body></html>
