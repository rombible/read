He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That great and terrible wilderness - Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>.

The "things" referred to are either the injunctions specified in <a href="/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21</a>, etc., or simply the instructions mentioned in the preceding verses. God had called the Israelites out of Egypt that they should go up at once to Canaan, and he had by Moses done all that was needed for this. But they had been rebellious, and had opposed God's commands, the consequence of which was that they had been made to experience various trials, especially to wander nearly forty years in the wilderness, so that of those who came out of Egypt only two were privileged to see the Promised Land. The words of Moses in this section supplement and complete the narrative in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>; but the words are those, not of a compiler, but of one who had been himself a witness of all he narrates. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That great and terrible wilderness</span>: the desert forming the western side of the Stony Arabia. It bears now the name of <span class="accented">Et-Tih</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. The Wandering, a name "doubtless derived from the wanderings of the Israelites, the tradition of which has been handed down through a period of three thousand years It is a pastoral <span class="accented">country</span>; unfitted as a whole for cultivation, because of its scanty soil and scarcity of water" (Dr. Porter, in Kitto's 'Biblical Cyclopedia,' vol. 3. p. 1075). In the northern part especially the country is rugged and bare, with vast tracts of sand, over which the scorching simoom often sweeps (see on ver. 1). This wilderness they had seen, had known, and had experience of, and their experience had been such that the district through which they had been doomed to wander appeared to them dreadful. Passing by the way of the Amorites, as they had been commanded (ver. 7), they came to Kadesh-barnea (see <a href="/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>). Their discontent broke out oftener than once, before they reached this place (see <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11, 12</a>.); but Moses, in this recapitulation, passes over these earlier instances of their rebelliousness, and hastens to remind them of the rebellion at Kadesh (<a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13, 14</a>.), because it was this which led to the nation being doomed to wander in the wilderness until the generation that came out of Egypt had died. It was through faith in God that Canaan was to be gained and occupied by Israel; but this faith they lacked, and so they came short of what God had summoned them t, attain (<a href="/psalms/78-22.htm">Psalm 78:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-24.htm">Psalm 106:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm">Hebrews 3:18, 19</a>; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a>). Hence, when they had come to the very borders of the Promised Land, and the hills of Canaan were before their eyes, and Moses said to them, in the name of God, <span class="cmt_word">Go up,</span> <span class="cmt_word">possess</span> ("asyndeton emphaticum," Mi-chaelis), they hung back, and proposed that men should be sent out to survey the land and bring a report concerning it. This was approved of by Moses; but when the spies returned and gave their report, the people were discouraged, and refused to go up. They were thus <span class="cmt_word">rebellious against the commandment</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the mouth</span>, the express will) of Jehovah their God; and not only so, but with signal ingratitude and impiety they murmured against him, and attributed their deliverance out of Egypt to God's hatred of them, that he might <span class="accented">destroy</span> them (see <a href="/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-33</a>, to which the narrative here corresponds). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, give here, provide for yourselves.
