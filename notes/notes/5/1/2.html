The route between Paran on the one side and the line from Tophel to Hazeroth on the other is still further defined as “a distance of eleven days’ journey from Horeb in the direction of Mount Seir, reaching to Kadesh-barnea.” The position of this last place is not yet determined with certainty. But the requirements of the text seem, upon the whole, to demand that it should be placed high up in the wilderness of Paran, not far from the border of the wilderness of Zin. It must be close to some passage out of the wilderness of Zin into the Negeb, or south of Judah.<p><span class= "bld">Kadesh-barnea.</span>—In the regular narrative of the exodus we read of the place to which the twelve spies returned as <span class= "ital">Kadesh </span>(<a href="/numbers/13-26.htm" title="And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.">Numbers 13:26</a>), and of the place at which the period of unrecorded wandering closed (<a href="/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>), in the first month of the fortieth year, as <span class= "ital">Kadesh. </span>The name Kadesh-barnea first appears in Moses’ speech (<a href="/numbers/32-8.htm" title="Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.">Numbers 32:8</a>), where he refers to the sending of the twelve spies. And with the exception of three places where the name is used in describing boundaries, Kadesh <span class= "ital">-harnea </span>is always found in speeches. This first chapter of Deuteronomy is the only one which contains the name both with and without the appendage <span class= "ital">-barnea, </span>which connects it with the wanderings of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-32.htm" title="Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>). Upon the whole, it seems most likely that only one place or district is intended by the name.<p>We have now obtained the following view of this first short introduction to the Book of Deuteronomy. It consists of words spoken (in the first instance) to all Israel on their march from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea. But the following verses show that the Law was further “declared” to Israel in the plains of Moab, at the close of the fortieth year of the exodus and of Moses’ life. It does not seem possible for us to separate entirely what was spoken earlier from what was declared later. In several places we have the record of words spoken: for example, in this very chapter (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-9.htm" title="And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm" title="And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-18.htm" title="And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.">Deuteronomy 1:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-20.htm" title="And I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give to us.">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-29.htm" title="Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.">Deuteronomy 1:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-43.htm" title="So I spoke to you; and you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>), and <a href="/deuteronomy/5-5.htm" title="(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, &c. And the very name Deuteronomy implies the repetition of a law previously given. Further, the exhortations contained in this book are all enforced by the immediate prospect of going over Jordan and entering the promised land. But when Israel marched from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea, it was with this very same prospect full in view. It does not appear, by what Moses “said” at that time (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-20.htm" title="And I said to you, You are come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give to us.">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>), that he had any thought of their turning away from the enterprise. But if so, what supposition is more natural than this—that he delivered the same kind of exhortations in the course of that earlier journey which he afterwards delivered in the plains of Moab? And although the distance is but eleven days’ march, the Israelites spent something like three months on the way, and in waiting for the spies to return from Canaan.<p>We conclude, then, that the first two verses of Deuteronomy are an editorial introduction, stating that the substance of this book was first delivered to Israel by Moses between Sinai and Kadesh-barnea. The further introduction which follows (in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;">Deuteronomy 1:3-5</a>) shows the words to have been re-delivered in the plains of Moab, and preserved in their later rather than their earlier form. But it is also possible that the two first verses of Deuteronomy are an introduction to the <span class= "ital">first </span>discourse above. (See Note on <a href="/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>.)<p>Is it possible to advance a step further, and conjecture with any degree of probability to what hand we owe the first two verses of the book? The expression “on the other side Jordan” (which some take to be a technical term) seems strictly to mean on the opposite side to the writer. The writer must also have been acquainted with the places mentioned (three of which are not named in the previous books); he could not have drawn his knowledge from the earlier part of the Pentateuch. And so entirely has the geography of <a href="/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a> been lost by tradition, that all the Targums and Jewish commentators agree in spiritualising the passage, and say, “these are the words of reproof which Moses.spake to all Israel in respect of their behaviour at these various places.” Laban points to their murmuring at the <span class= "ital">white </span>manna. Dizahab to the <span class= "ital">golden </span>calf, and so on. Even Rashi, usually a most literal commentator, says, “Moses has enumerated the places where they wrought provocation before the PLACE “—a Rabbinical name for Jehovah: for “the whole world is His place, though His place is more than the whole world.” This introduction to Deuteronomy seems the work of one who had known the wilderness, and yet wrote from Palestine. Joshua, the next writer to Moses, and possibly also his amanuensis, may have prefixed it to the book. If he did not, it is wholly impossible to say who did.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/1-2.htm" title="(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea.)">Deuteronomy 1:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">There are eleven days’ journey — </span>This is added, to show that the reason why the Israelites in so many years were advanced no farther from Horeb than to these plains, was not the distance of the places, but because of their rebellions. <span class="ital">Kadesh-barnea — </span>Which was not far from the borders of Canaan.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 Moses spake to the people all the Lord had given him in commandment.

There are eleven days' journey from Horeb&#8212;Distances are computed in the East still by the hours or days occupiesd by the journey. A day's journey on foot is about twenty miles&#8212;on camels, at the rate of three miles an hour, thirty miles&#8212;and by caravans, about twenty-five miles. But the Israelites, with children and flocks, would move at a slow rate. The length of the Ghor from Ezion-geber to Kadesh is a hundred miles. The days here mentioned were not necessarily successive days [Robinson], for the journey can be made in a much shorter period. But this mention of the time was made to show that the great number of years spent in travelling from Horeb to the plain of Moab was not owing to the length of the way, but to a very different cause; namely, banishment for their apostasy and frequent rebellions.<p>mount Seir&#8212;the mountainous country of Edom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is added to show that the reason why the Israelites in so many years were advanced no further from Horeb than to these plains, was not the great distance of the places or length of the way, which was but a journey of eleven days at most, but because of their rebellions, as is mentioned before and repeated in this book. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Horeb, </span> or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sinai, </span> the place where the law was given, which is promiscuously called by both those names. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Mount Seir, </span> or Mount Edom, i.e. the mountainous country of Seir, which was first possessed by the Horims, and afterwards by the Edomites, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm" title="The Horims also dwelled in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.">Deu 2:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Kadesh-barnea</span> was not far from the borders of Canaan.

Not that the Israelites came thither in eleven days from Horeb, for they stayed by the way at Kibrothhattaavah, a whole month at least, and seven days at Hazeroth; but the sense is, that this was the computed distance between the two places; it was what was reckoned a man might walk in eleven days; and if we reckon a day's journey twenty miles, of which See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>, the distance must be two hundred and twenty miles. But Dr. Shaw (e) allows but ten miles for a day's journey, and then it was no more than one hundred and ten, and indeed a camp cannot be thought to move faster; but not the day's journey of a camp, but of a man, seems to be intended, who may very well walk twenty miles a day for eleven days running; but it seems more strange that another learned traveller (f) should place Kadeshbarnea at eight hours, or ninety miles distance only from Mount Sinai. Moses computes not the time that elapsed between those two places, including their stations, but only the time of travelling; and yet Jarchi says, though it was eleven days' journey according to common computation, the Israelites performed it in three days; for he observes that they set out from Horeb on the twentieth of Ijar, and on the twenty ninth of Sivan the spies were sent out from Kadeshbarnea; and if you take from hence the whole month they were at one place, and the seven days at another, there will be but three days left for them to travel in. And he adds, that the Shechinah, or divine Majesty, pushed them forward, to hasten their going into the land; but they corrupting themselves, he turned them about Mount Seir forty years. It is not easy to say for what reason these words are expressed, unless it be to show in how short a time the Israelites might have been in the land of Canaan, in a few days' journey from Horeb, had it not been for their murmurings and unbelief, for which they were turned into the wilderness again, and travelled about for the space of thirty eight years afterwards. Aben Ezra is of opinion, that the eleven days, for the word "journey" is not in the text, are to be connected with the preceding words; and that the sense is, that Moses spake these words in the above places, in the eleven days they went from Horeb to Kadesh. <p>(e) De loc.

Sacr.</span> ed. Lagarde, 146). This matter as well as the questions of the position of Sinai-Ḥoreb (as between Jebel Musa and Jebel Serbal and between the Sinaitic Peninsula as a whole and the E. coast of the Gulf of ‘Aḳabah or Mt Se‘îr or the neighbourhood of Ḳadesh) has already been exhaustively discussed in this series (Driver, <span class="ital">Exod.</span> pp. 18, 177–191). It is, therefore, unnecessary to say anything more here; except to recall that the question as between the Sinaitic Peninsula and some site farther N. appears to have been open in the time of the Crusades and of the Moslem geographers in the 14th century.

According to ver. 19, the Israelites, when they left Horeb, passed through the wilderness along the way that led to the mountains of the Amorites, and came to Kadesh-barnea. Kadesh must, therefore, be looked for, not on the eastern side of the 'Arabah, but somewhere in the wilderness of Zin. It has been identified with the place now known as 'Ain Kudes, near the northern extremity of Jebel Halal, and to the east of that hill; but this is far from being certain. Moses reminds the Israelites that the distance between Horeb and Kadesh is eleven days - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, about one hundred and sixty-five miles, the day's journey being reckoned at fifteen miles - not to give them a piece of information, but rather to suggest to them how, in consequence of rebellion, a journey which might have been so easily accomplished, had been protracted through many wearisome years. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses declared that what they had affirmed was right (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;), and then, by command of Jehovah, he told the daughters of Zelophehad that they might marry whoever pleased them (the suffix &#1470;&#1492;&#1501;, attached to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, for &#1470;&#1492;&#1503;, as in <a href="/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9</a>, etc.), but that he must belong to the family of their father's tribe, that is to say, must be a Manassite.
