He owns the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham, and prays for the further accomplishment of it. We are not straitened in the power and goodness of God; why should we be straitened in our own faith and hope? Good laws were given to the Israelites, and good men were to see to the execution of them, which showed God's goodness to them, and the care of Moses.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This appointment of the "captains" (compare <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a> ff) must not be confounded with that of the elders in <a href="/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> ff. The former would number 78,600; the latter were 70 only.<p>A comparison between this passage and that in Exodus makes it obvious that Moses is only touching on certain parts of the whole history, without regard to order of time, but with a special purpose. This important arrangement for the good government of the people took place before they left Horeb to march direct to the promised land. This fact sets more clearly before us the perverseness and ingratitude of the people, to which the orator next passes; and shows, what he was anxious to impress, that the fault of the 40 years' delay rested only with themselves! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude&#8212;This was neither an Oriental hyperbole nor a mere empty boast.

The Israelites already far exceeded that number, being at the last census above six hundred thousand [Nu 26:51].

The word of Jehovah mentioned here is not found in this form in the previous history; but as a matter of fact it is contained in the divine instructions that were preparatory to their removal (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1-4</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-10:10</a>), and the rising of the cloud from the tabernacle, which followed immediately afterwards (<a href="/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>). The fixed use of the name Horeb to designate the mountain group in general, instead of the special name Sinai, which is given to the particular mountain upon which the law was given, is in keeping with the rhetorical style of the book.</body></html>
