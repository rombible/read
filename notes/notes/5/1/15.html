But the verse, though awkward, may mean that Moses took those elected within the various tribes (<span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm" title="Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.">Deuteronomy 1:13</a></span>) and made them chiefs with judicial functions in the new <span class="ital">national</span> organisation which he now instituted: so in E, <a href="/exodus/18-25.htm" title="And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.">Exodus 18:25</a>, <span class="ital">he set them chiefs over the people</span>, as a whole.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">captains of thousands, hundreds, fifties, tens</span>] <span class="ital">Captains</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">sarîm</span>.

Did such military <span class="ital">sarîm</span> already exist in the time of Israel’s wanderings, and is it meant, here and in Exodus 18, that the popularly elected heads took such military titles on their appointment? Or were these military ranks first instituted under the monarchy, when an organised national army took the place of the old tribal levies, and have the writers of E and D (cp. P, <a href="/numbers/31-14.htm" title="And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.">Numbers 31:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-28.htm" title="And levy a tribute to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:">Numbers 31:28</a>) merely reflected this institution of their own times back on the period of the wandering? Or are we to hold with Steuernagel that although <a href="/context/exodus/18-13.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening....">Exodus 18:13-26</a> deals throughout with the institution of <span class="ital">judges</span> this deuteronomic review, <span class="ital"><a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-9.htm" title="And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:...">Deuteronomy 1:9-15</a></span>, narrates the appointment not of <span class="ital">judges</span> but of military and administrative officers and that we reach the judges only in <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm" title="And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.">Deuteronomy 1:16</a></span>, where their title first occurs and where a new paragraph is indicated by the recurrence of the formula, <span class="ital">and at that time</span>? In support of his view, Steuernagel alleges that only intellectual qualities are required for the officers dealt with in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-9.htm" title="And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:...">Deuteronomy 1:9-15</a></span>, while in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.">Exodus 18:13</a> ff., where judges are intended throughout, the requirements are moral. But this point we have already answered above on <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm" title="Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.">Deuteronomy 1:13</a></span>. Further Steuernagel’s explanation neither solves the difficulty in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.">Exodus 18:13</a> ff.

None of the explanations is satisfactory. The evidence that even under Moses the tribal institutions were welded into a national organisation is frequent and probable; and that main fact may be held, even if we allow, as equally probable, that E and D reflected back upon it the military titles of their own day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and officers</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">shôṭerîm</span>, with the original meaning either of <span class="ital">rangers, organisers</span> (so Dri. after Nöldeke, citing Ar. <span class="ital">saṭara</span> ‘to rule’ a book, ‘write,’ and <span class="ital">saṭr</span> ‘line’ or ‘row,’ cp.

The "swearing" on the part of God points back to <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>. The expression "to them and to their seed" is the same as "to thee and to thy seed" in <a href="/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>, and is not to be understood as signifying that the patriarchs themselves ought to have taken actual possession of Canaan; but "to their seed" is in apposition, and also a more precise definition (comp. <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, where the simple statement "to thee" is explained by the fuller statement "to thy seed"). &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; has grown into an interjection  equals  &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;: to give before a person, equivalent to give up to a person, or place at his free disposal (for the use of the word in this sense, see <a href="/genesis/13-9.htm">Genesis 13:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-10.htm">Genesis 34:10</a>). Jehovah (this is the idea of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6-8</a>), when He concluded the covenant with the Israelites at Horeb, had intended to fulfil at once the promise which He gave to the patriarchs, and to put them into possession of the promised land; and Moses had also done what was required on his part, as he explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9-18</a>, to bring the people safety to Canaan (cf. <a href="/exodus/18-23.htm">Exodus 18:23</a>). As the nation had multiplied as the stars of heaven, in accordance with the promise of the Lord, and he felt unable to bear the burden alone and settle all disputes, he had placed over them at that time wise and intelligent men from the heads of the tribes to act as judges, and had instructed them to adjudicate upon the smaller matters of dispute righteously and without respect of person. For further particulars concerning the appointment of the judges, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>, where it is related how Moses adopted this plan at the advice of Jethro, even before the giving of the law at Sinai. The expression "at that time," in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, is not at variance with this. The imperfect &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with vav rel., expresses the order of thought and not of time. For Moses did not intend to recall the different circumstances to the recollection of the people in their chronological order, but arranged them according to their relative importance in connection with the main object of his address. And this required that he should begin with what God had done for the fulfilment of His promise, and then proceed afterwards to notice what he, the servant of God, had done in his office, as an altogether subordinate matter. So far as this object was concerned, it was also perfectly indifferent who had advised him to adopt this plan, whilst it was very important to allude to the fact that it was the great increase in the number of the Israelites which had rendered it necessary, that he might remind the congregation how the Lord, even at that time, had fulfilled the promise which He gave to the patriarchs, and in that fulfilment had given a practical guarantee of the certain fulfilment of the other promises as well. Moses accomplished this by describing the increase of the nation in such a way that his hearers should be involuntarily reminded of the covenant promise in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>. (cf. <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>).</body></html>
