It would seem, then, that at this period Moses began to throw the discourses and laws that he had delivered into a permanent form, arranging and writing them with the same motive which influenced the Apostle Peter (<a href="/2_peter/1-15.htm" title="Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.">2Peter 1:15</a>), “Moreover, I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.”<p>In this discourse the history of Israel, from the time of their departure from Sinai, is briefly recapitulated (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-29.htm" title="So we stayed in the valley over against Bethpeor.">Deuteronomy 3:29</a>), and with a short practical exhortation. This portion of history comprises three periods of the exodus: (1) <span class= "ital">The march from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea, </span>with the sending of the twelve spies and its results, related more at length in <a href="/numbers/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.">Numbers 10:11</a>—end of Deuteronomy 14. The characteristic feature of this period is <span class= "ital">failure </span>on the part of both leaders and people to rise to their high calling. Moses (Numbers 11), Aaron and Miriam (Num. xii), Joshua (<a href="/numbers/11-28.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.">Numbers 11:28</a>), the spies, who were also rulers (Deuteronomy 13, 14), and the people throughout, all in turn exhibit the defects of their character. In the end the enterprise is abandoned for the time. (2) <span class= "ital">The thirty seven and a half years that follow </span>are a period of disgrace, as appears by the absence of all note of time or place in the direct narrative between Numbers 14 and Numbers 20. Certain places are mentioned in Numbers 33 which must belong to this period, but nothing is recorded of them beyond the names. A single verse (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>), is all that is assignable to that period in this discourse of Moses. This long wandering was also a <span class= "ital">period of training and discipline. </span>(3) <span class= "ital">The fortieth year of the exodus, </span>in which the conquest of Sihon and Og was effected, and Israel reached the banks of Jordan.

Though God brings his people into trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried long enough.

So Steuern. and Berth. But in the other 18 instances of the phrase <span class="ital">this Tôrah</span> in D) it is used of the deuteronomic code and indeed in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-8.htm" title="And what nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?">Deuteronomy 4:8</a> is parallel to <span class="ital">statutes and judgements</span>. We may take it in the same sense here (so Driver), equivalent indeed to no mere catalogue of laws, but to laws with notes, exhortations, precedents and reminiscences. If that be the meaning of <span class="ital">Tôrah</span> in this title, it proves that the discourse to which the title is attached, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm" title="The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:">Deuteronomy 1:6</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm" title="You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>, was originally designed as an introduction to the code <a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-12.htm" title="How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?...">Deuteronomy 1:12-26</a>.

The Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) signifies primarily to cut or dig, then to cut into, to grave, and then to cut or dig out so as to make evident, to declare, to make plain. What Moses set himself to do, then, was not to publish a new law, but to make plain to the people the Law already promulgated, to set forth clearly and pointedly what they were required by the Law to be and to do. This explains more fully the "spake" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>) of ver. 3. This exposition of the Law was designed specially for the sake of those who, at the time the Law was first promulgated, either were not born or were incapable of understanding it (Grotius). The expression used by Moses plainly indicates that this book was not intended to furnish a second code of laws different from the former, but simply to explain and enforce what had before been enjoined. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/36-10.htm">Numbers 36:10-12</a> it is related that, in accordance with these instructions, the five daughters of Zelophehad, whose names are repeated from <a href="/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a> and <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a> (see also <a href="/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>), married husbands from the families of the Manassites, namely, sons of their cousins (? uncles), and thus their inheritance remained in their father's tribe (&#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, to be and remain upon anything). </body></html>
