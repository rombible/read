Accordingly, when the people desired a king, they applied to Samuel, a prophet of the Lord. In all cases, God's choice, if we can but know it, should direct, determine, and overrule ours. Laws are given for the prince that should be elected. He must carefully avoid every thing that would turn him from God and religion. Riches, honours, and pleasures, are three great hinderances of godliness, (the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life,) especially to those in high stations; against these the king is here warned. The king must carefully study the law of God, and make that his rule; and having a copy of the Scriptures of his own writing, must read therein all the days of his life. It is not enough to have Bibles, but we must use them, use them daily, as long as we live. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bibles, but will have constant occasion for them, till they come to that world where knowledge and love will be made perfect. The king's writing and reading were as nothing, if he did not practise what he wrote and read. And those who fear God and keep his commandments, will fare the better for it even in this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The horse was not anciently used in the East for purposes of agriculture or traveling, but ordinarily for war only. He appears constantly in Scripture as the symbol and embodiment of fleshly strength and the might of the creature (compare <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>; <a href="/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19</a> ff), and is sometimes significantly spoken of simply as "the strong one" (compare <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>). The spirit of the prohibition therefore is that the king of Israel must not, like other earthly potentates, put his trust in costly and formidable preparations for war (compare <a href="/hosea/1-7.htm">Hosea 1:7</a>).<p>Egypt was the principal source from where the nations of western Asia drew their supplies of this animal (compare <a href="/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5</a> ff; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28-29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>); but contact, traffic, or alliance which would "cause the people to return to Egypt" would be to reverse that great and beneficent wonderwork of God which inaugurated the Mosaic covenant, the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt; and to bring about of set purpose that which God threatened <a href="/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Deuteronomy 28:68</a> as the most severe punishment for Israel's sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. he shall not multiply horses to himself&#8212;The use of these animals was not absolutely prohibited, nor is there any reason to conclude that they might not be employed as part of the state equipage. But the multiplication of horses would inevitably lead to many evils, to increased intercourse with foreign nations, especially with Egypt, to the importation of an animal to which the character of the country was not suited, to the establishment of an Oriental military despotism, to proud and pompous parade in peace, to a dependence upon Egypt in time of war, and a consequent withdrawal of trust and confidence in God. (2Sa 8:4; 1Ki 10:26; 2Ch 1:16; 9:28; Isa 31:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He shall not multiply horses to himself, </span> to wit, excessively, beyond what the state and majesty of his place required.

It is forbidden to him to multiply horses, to multiply wives, and to amass large treasures of silver and gold, and he must have a copy of the Law written out for him from that kept by the priests, that he might have it by him, and read it all the days of his life. The multiplying of horses is prohibited, because this would bring Israel into intercourse and friendly relations with Egypt, and might tend to their going back to that country from which they had been so marvelously delivered; a prohibition which could only have been given at an early stage in the history of the people, for at a later period, after they had been well established in Canaan, such a prohibition for such a reason would have been simply ridiculous. The prohibition to multiply wives and to amass large treasures has respect to the usage common from the earliest period with Oriental monarchs to have vast harems and huge accumulations of the precious metals, as much for ostentation as for either luxury or use; and as there was no small danger of the King of Israel being seduced to follow this usage, and so to have his heart turned away from the Lord, it was fitting that such a prohibition should be prospectively enacted for his guidance. Both these prohibitions were neglected by Solomon, and probably by others of the Jewish kings; but this only indicates that the law was so ancient that it had come in their time to be regarded as obsolete. The rule that the king was to write him a copy of the Law for his own constant use does not necessarily imply that he was to write this with his own hand; he might cause it to be written by some qualified scribe for him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They shall do "according to the sound of the word which they utter" (follow their decision exactly), and that "according to the sound of the law which they teach," and "according to the right which they shall speak."
