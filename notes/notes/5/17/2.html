The penalty there is directed against the teachers of idolatry, whether prophets, private individuals, or communities in Israel.

There is really no such thing as wickedness in the world apart from some wicked being or person. We are also reminded of the famous argument of St. Augustine, that evil has no existence except as a corruption of good, or a creature’s perverted will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/17-2.htm" title="If there be found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, man or woman, that has worked wickedness in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,">Deuteronomy 17:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">In transgressing his covenant — </span>That is, in idolatry, as it is explained <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm" title="And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>, which is called a transgression of God’s covenant made with Israel, both because it was a breach of their faith given to God, and of that law which they covenanted to keep; and because it was a dissolution of that matrimonial covenant with God, a renouncing of God and his worship, and a choosing other gods.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-7 No creature which had any blemish was to be offered in sacrifice to God.

This thought forms the link between the laws already given and those which follow. Civil order - that indispensable condition of the stability and prosperity of nations and states - rests upon a conscientious maintenance of right by means of a well-ordered judicial constitution and an impartial administration of justice. - For the purpose of settling the disputes of the people, Moses had already provided them with judges at Sinai, and had given the judges themselves the necessary instructions for the fulfilment of their duties (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a>). This arrangement might suffice as long as the people were united in one camp and had Moses for a leader, who could lay before God any difficult cases that were brought to him, and give an absolute decision with divine authority. But for future times, when Israel would no longer possess a prophet and mediator like Moses, and after the conquest of Canaan would live scattered about in the towns and villages of the whole land, certain modifications and supplementary additions were necessary to adapt this judicial constitution to the altered circumstances of the people. Moses anticipates this want in the following provisions, in which he first of all commands the appointment of judges and officials in every town, and gives certain precise injunctions as to their judicial proceedings (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-17:7</a>); and secondly, appoints a higher judicial court at the place of the sanctuary for the more difficult cases (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>); and thirdly, gives them a law for the future with reference to the choice of a king (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14-20</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a><p>Appointment and Instruction of the Judges. - <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>. "Judges and officers thou shalt appoint thee in all thy gates (place, see at <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>), which Jehovah thy God shall give thee, according to thy tribes." The nation is addressed as a whole, and directed to appoint for itself judges and officers, i.e., to choose them, and have them appointed by its rulers, just as was done at Sinai, where the people chose the judges, and Moses inducted into office the persons so chosen (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-12.htm">Deuteronomy 1:12-18</a>). That the same course was to be adopted in future, is evident from the expression, "throughout thy tribes," i.e., according to thy tribes, which points back to <a href="/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13</a>. Election by majorities was unknown to the Mosaic law. The shoterim, officers (lit., writers, see at <a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>), who were associated with the judges, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>, even under the previous arrangement, were not merely messengers and servants of the courts, but secretaries and advisers of the judges, who derived their title from the fact that they had to draw up and keep the genealogical lists, and who are mentioned as already existing in Egypt as overseers of the people and of their work (see at <a href="/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>; and for the different opinions concerning their official position, see Selden, de Synedriis, i. pp. 342-3). The new features, which Moses introduces here, consist simply in the fact that every place was to have its own judges and officers, whereas hitherto they had only been appointed for the larger and smaller divisions of the nation, according to their genealogical organization. Moses lays down no rule as to the number of judges and shoterim to be appointed in each place, because this would depend upon the number of the inhabitants; and the existing arrangement of judges over tens, hundreds, etc. (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>), would still furnish the necessary standard. The statements made by Josephus and the Rabbins with regard to the number of judges in each place are contradictory, or at all events are founded upon the circumstances of much later times (see my Archologie, ii. pp. 257-8). - These judges were to judge the people with just judgment. The admonition in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a> corresponds to the instructions in <a href="/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6</a> and <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>. "Respect persons:" as in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-17.htm">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>. To this there is added, in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>, an emphatic admonition to strive zealously to maintain justice. The repetition of the word justice is emphatic: justice, and nothing but justice, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-10.htm">Genesis 14:10</a>, etc. But in order to give the people and the judges appointed by them a brief practical admonition, as to the things they were more especially to observe in their administration of justice, Moses notices by way of example a few crimes that were deserving of punishment (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-22.htm">Deuteronomy 16:22</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/17-1.htm">Deuteronomy 17:1</a>), and then proceeds in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-2.htm">Deuteronomy 17:2-7</a> to describe more fully the judicial proceedings in the case of idolaters. </body></html>
