"The priests and Levites," should rather be "the priests&#8212;the Levites"; that is, the Levitical priests, including the high priest, who were members of the legislative assembly; and who, as forming one body, are called "the judge." Their sittings were held in the neighborhood of the sanctuary because in great emergencies the high priest had to consult God by Urim (Nu 27:21).

On the testimony of two or three witnesses, not of one only, he was to be put to death (see at <a href="/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>); and the hand of the witnesses was to be against him first to put him to death, i.e., to throw the first stones at him, and all the people were to follow.

"Bring him out to thy gates," i.e., to one of the gates of the town in which the crime was committed. By the gates we are to understand the open space near the gates, where the judicial proceedings took place (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>; Job. Deu 29:7), the sentence itself being executed outside the town (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-24.htm">Deuteronomy 22:24</a>; <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), just as it had been outside the camp during the journey through the wilderness (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-36.htm">Numbers 15:36</a>), to indicate the exclusion of the criminal from the congregation, and from fellowship with God. The infliction of punishment in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>. is like that prescribed in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10-11</a>, for those who tempted others to idolatry; with this exception, that the testimony of more than one witness was required before the sentence could be executed, and the witnesses were to be the first to lift up their hands against the criminal to stone him, that they might thereby give a practical proof of the truth of their statement, and their own firm conviction that the condemned was deserving of death, -  "a rule which would naturally lead to the supposition that no man would come forward as a witness without the fullest certainty or the greatest depravity" (Schnell, das isr. Recht).<p>(Note: "He assigned this part to the witnesses, chiefly because there are so many whose tongue is so slippery, not to say good for nothing, that they would boldly strangle a man with their words, when they would not dare to touch him with one of their fingers.
