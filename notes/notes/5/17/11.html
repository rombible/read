The Priests and Judges to Determine Controversies.<p>8-13. If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment&#8212;In all civil or criminal cases, where there was any doubt or difficulty in giving a decision, the local magistrates were to submit them by reference to the tribunal of the Sanhedrim&#8212;the supreme council, which was composed partly of civil and partly of ecclesiastical persons. "The priests and Levites," should rather be "the priests&#8212;the Levites"; that is, the Levitical priests, including the high priest, who were members of the legislative assembly; and who, as forming one body, are called "the judge." Their sittings were held in the neighborhood of the sanctuary because in great emergencies the high priest had to consult God by Urim (Nu 27:21). From their judgment there was no appeal; and if a person were so perverse and refractory as to refuse obedience to their sentences, his conduct, as inconsistent with the maintenance of order and good government, was then to be regarded and punished as a capital crime.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee:</span> these words are a manifest limitation of the foregoing assertion, that they were to do according to all that the judge or judges informed him.

The people in their obedience; first they shall not simply obey them in all things, but so far forth as their sentence is according to the law and word of God, but not when their commands are evidently contrary to God’s laws, for then, say even popish commentators on this place, they must obey God rather than man. And this cannot be denied by any man of sense, upon supposition that this place speaks of, and this power given to the priest or judge reacheth to, all controversies or questions of faith and manners, as the papists would extend it: for put case these priests or judges’ should give a sentence directly contrary to the express words of God’s law, <span class="ital">Thou shalt worship a graven image</span>, as Aaron did in the case of the calf, <span class="ital">thou shalt profane the sabbath, thou shalt dishonour thy father and mother, thou shalt murder, steal, commit adultery</span>, &c., I ask, were the people in this case bound to do as the judge determined, or not? If any say they were, such a bold and wicked assertion must need strike all sober Christians with horror; and if they say they were not, then this must needs be taken for a limitation.

And in all such cases, although the judge be hereby confined and tied to his rule in giving the sentence, yet it seems but fit and reasonable that people should be bound simply to acquiesce in the sentence of their last and highest judge, or else there would have been no end of strife. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee,....

On the testimony of two or three witnesses, not of one only, he was to be put to death (see at <a href="/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>); and the hand of the witnesses was to be against him first to put him to death, i.e., to throw the first stones at him, and all the people were to follow.

"Bring him out to thy gates," i.e., to one of the gates of the town in which the crime was committed. By the gates we are to understand the open space near the gates, where the judicial proceedings took place (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>; Job. Deu 29:7), the sentence itself being executed outside the town (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-24.htm">Deuteronomy 22:24</a>; <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), just as it had been outside the camp during the journey through the wilderness (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-36.htm">Numbers 15:36</a>), to indicate the exclusion of the criminal from the congregation, and from fellowship with God.

Recht).<p>(Note: "He assigned this part to the witnesses, chiefly because there are so many whose tongue is so slippery, not to say good for nothing, that they would boldly strangle a man with their words, when they would not dare to touch him with one of their fingers.
