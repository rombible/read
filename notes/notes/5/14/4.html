Here is election; The Lord hath chosen thee. He did not choose them because they were by their own acts a peculiar people to him above other nations, but he chose them that they might be so by his grace; and thus were believers chosen, Eph 1:4. Here is adoption; Ye are the children of the Lord your God; not because God needed children, but because they were orphans, and needed a father. Every spiritual Israelite is indeed a child of God, a partaker of his nature and favour. Here is sanctification; Thou art a holy people. God's people are required to be holy, and if they are holy, they are indebted to the grace God which makes them so. Those whom God chooses to be his children, he will form to be a holy people, and zealous of good works. They must be careful to avoid every thing which might disgrace their profession, in the sight of those who watch for their halting. Our heavenly Father forbids nothing but for our welfare. Do thyself no harm; do not ruin thy health, thy reputation, thy domestic comforts, thy peace of mind. Especially do not murder thy soul. Do not be the vile slave of thy appetites and passions. Do not render all around thee miserable, and thyself wretched; but aim at that which is most excellent and useful. The laws which regarded many sorts of flesh as unclean, were to keep them from mingling with their idolatrous neighbours. It is plain in the gospel, that these laws are now done away. But let us ask our own hearts, Are we of the children of the Lord our God? Are we separate from the ungodly world, in being set apart to God's glory, the purchase of Christ's blood? Are we subjects of the work of the Holy Ghost? Lord, teach us from these precepts how pure and holy all thy people ought to live!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>.

In ancient times the enjoyment of flesh by ordinary people was rare; that of the domestic animals was limited to special occasions such as the arrival of a guest, or a family festival, but kings and the rich ate it every day, and successful raids were celebrated by feasting upon the animal spoil (e.g. <a href="/judges/6-19.htm" title="And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.">Jdg 6:19</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.">1 Samuel 14:32</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm" title="And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.">1 Samuel 16:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm" title="Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.">1 Samuel 25:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-24.htm" title="And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:">1 Samuel 28:24</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/12-4.htm" title="And there came a travelers to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come to him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.">2 Samuel 12:4</a>, <a href="/1_kings/4-23.htm" title="Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl.">1 Kings 4:23</a>, <a href="/amos/6-4.htm" title="That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;">Amos 6:4</a>). The flesh was, as still in Syria and Arabia, usually of sheep and goats; Arabs regard the former as the more honourable for a guest. Bullocks and calves were slain much more seldom, except in great houses. So it is still with the fellaḥin; while in Arabia, where pasture is scarce and the oxen are for the most part meagre and stunted, ox flesh is very rarely eaten; and its place is taken by that of the camel (see below). Ancient Arab physicians held beef to be poisonous; in parts of S. Arabia it was eaten only by the very poor; to set it even before a servant was regarded as an insult (Georg Jacob, <span class="ital">Altarabisches Beduinenleben</span>, 94).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-20.</span> - The regulations here concerning food, and the animals the use of which is forbidden, are substantially the same as in <a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a>.

"All that is in it" relates to men, cattle, and the material property of the town, and not to men alone (Schultz). The clause from "destroying" to "therein" is a more minute definition of the punishment introduced as a parenthesis; for "the cattle thereof," which follows, is also governed by "thou shalt smite." The ban was to be executed in all its severity as upon an idolatrous city: man and beast were to be put to death without reserves; and its booty, i.e., whatever was to be found in it as booty-all material goods, therefore - were to be heaped together in the market, and burned along with the city itself. &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; (Eng. Ver. "every whit, for the Lord thy God") signifies "as a whole offering for the Lord" (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-15.htm">Leviticus 6:15-16</a>), i.e., it was to be sanctified to Him entirely by being destroyed. The town was to continue an eternal hill (or heap of ruins), never to be built up again. </body></html>
