There was as yet no provision made by which all could serve in turn at the tabernacle. When David divided them all into courses, priests, Levites, singers (and porters?) alike, there was no longer any need for this provision. The institutions of David prove its antiquity. The only case in history that illustrates it is that of the child Samuel. His father, Elkanah, was a descendant of Korah. He dwelt in Mount Ephraim, and came up to Shiloh year by year. But Samuel was dedicated by his mother to perpetual service there, and as long as the tabernacle continued in Shiloh, the child Samuel “ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest”—not as a priest, but as a Levite in attendance upon the priests.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/18-6.htm" title="And if a Levite come from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind to the place which the LORD shall choose;">Deuteronomy 18:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">With all the desire of his mind — </span>With full purpose to fix his abode, and to spend his whole time and strength in the service of God.

Should any Levite, however, under the influence of eminent piety, resolve to devote himself wholly and continually to the sacred duties of the sanctuary, he was allowed to realize his ardent wishes; and as he was admitted to a share of the work, so also to a share of the remuneration. Though he might have private property, that was to form no ground for withholding or even diminishing his claim to maintenance like the other ministering priests. The reason or principle of the enactment is obvious (1Co 9:13). At the same time, while every facility was afforded for the admission of such a zealous and self-denying officer, this admission was to be in an orderly manner: he was to minister "as all his brethren"&#8212;that is, a Gershonite with Gershonites; a Merarite with Merarites; so that there might be no derangement of the established courses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either for any private occasions, or to sojourn there for a season, or rather with full purpose to fix his abode, and to spend his whole time and strength in the service of God, as appears by the <span class="ital">sale of his patrimony</span>, mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/18-8.htm" title="They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which comes of the sale of his patrimony.">Deu 18:8</a></span>.

Though Jarchi interprets it of a priest, that comes and offers his freewill offerings, or what he is obliged to, and even in a ward not his own; or, as otherwise expressed, of the priests that come to the feast, who offer in the ward, and serve in the offerings that come by virtue of the feast, as the additions of the feast, though it is not in their own ward; and indeed every priest was a Levite, though every Levite was not a priest; and the description of him after given, as standing ministering in the name of the Lord, best agrees with a priest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;</span><p>(c) Meaning, to serve God whole heartedly, and not to seek ease.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">a Levite … from any of thy gates</span>] any of the tribe who had ministered at any of the rural sanctuaries now disestablished by the concentration of the cultus at Jerusalem. <span class="ital">Thy gates</span>, see <a href="/deuteronomy/12-12.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>. <span class="ital">Out of all Israel</span>, emphatic addition to the usual phrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">where he sojourneth</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">is a gçr</span>, a landless resident, without portion or inheritance.
