The Levite who desired to settle at the place of the sanctuary would probably sell his patrimony when quitting his former home. The text directs that he should, notwithstanding any such private resources, duly enjoy his share of the perquisites provided for the ministers at the sanctuary, and as he was "waiting at the altar" should be "partaker with the altar" <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. if a Levite &#8230; come with all the desire of his mind&#8212;It appears that the Levites served in rotation from the earliest times; but, from their great numbers, it was only at infrequent intervals they could be called into actual service. Should any Levite, however, under the influence of eminent piety, resolve to devote himself wholly and continually to the sacred duties of the sanctuary, he was allowed to realize his ardent wishes; and as he was admitted to a share of the work, so also to a share of the remuneration. Though he might have private property, that was to form no ground for withholding or even diminishing his claim to maintenance like the other ministering priests. The reason or principle of the enactment is obvious (1Co 9:13). At the same time, while every facility was afforded for the admission of such a zealous and self-denying officer, this admission was to be in an orderly manner: he was to minister "as all his brethren"&#8212;that is, a Gershonite with Gershonites; a Merarite with Merarites; so that there might be no derangement of the established courses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Like portions, </span> to wit, with their brethren who were in actual ministration; as they share with them in the work, so shall they also in the encouragements. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony; </span> though he have an estate whereby he may subsist raised by the sale of his house in his city, and his cattle, and other movables, yet you shall not upon this ground either deny or diminish their part of your maintenance.

Equal parts of the sacrifices with the priests that usually ministered there; hence we learn, says Jarchi, that they divided the skins and flesh of the sin offerings; perhaps even such as did not come by virtue of the feast, as the daily sacrifices, and the additions of the sabbath, and the vows, and the freewill offerings: <p>beside that which cometh by the sale of his patrimony: for though the priests and Levites had no inheritance divided to them in the land, yet they might buy houses and fields, and leave them to their children, and this may be called their patrimony; now it was not reasonable that they should wholly live upon this, or spend what their fathers left them; but, besides the income of that, were to have their part and portion with their brethren in the sacrifices of the sanctuary. But some interpret these words in a different way, as if they had respect to the gifts and oblations in the several wards in which the priests ministered, as they were ordered by their fathers, Eleazar, Ithamar, Samuel, David, and Solomon; so the Targums of Onkelos, Jonathan, and Jarchi. In the times of Eleazar and Ithamar, there were only eight wards or courses, which ministered in their turns, but in the days of David they were divided into twenty four; See Gill on <a href="/luke/1-8.htm">Luke 1:8</a>; now the ordering and fixing these in their turns is called a vendition or sale; and these country priests might partake of all sacrifices at the feast, excepting those which belonged to him whose course it was that week. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They shall have like portions to eat, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.</span><p>(d) Not forced to live from himself.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">They shall have</span>] Sam.

EVV.’s paraphrase is generally accepted; cp. <a href="/context/jeremiah/32-6.htm" title="And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Jeremiah 32:6-15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/37-12.htm" title="Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself there in the middle of the people.">Jeremiah 37:12</a> (R.V.), which shows a priest from a rural sanctuary, who had removed to Jerusalem, possessing money of his own and by right of redemption able to buy land which a relative desired to sell. Dillm., rejecting the usual interpretation as too obvious, proposes ‘the money which he realised on such dues as had fallen to him from the families to whom he ministered at his home.’ A certain solution of the difficulty is hardly possible. Either we have an abbreviated legal formula the meaning of which is lost, or the text is corrupt. By small emendations, Steuern. ingeniously reads: ‘except those who are idolatrous priests and necromancers.’ This is agreeable to the spirit of D, guards against an easy abuse of the law and is in harmony with the next law; but it has to be forced out of even the emended syntax.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This law of D, establishing the rural Levites, who come to Jerusalem, in equal rank and privilege with their fellow-tribesmen already ministering there, was not carried out. <a href="/2_kings/23-9.htm" title="Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brothers.">2 Kings 23:9</a> states that <span class="ital">the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah at Jerusalem but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren</span>. Apparently the Jerusalem priests succeeded from the first in keeping off the rural Levites from the priestly function of sacrifice on the ground that the cults which they had served were idolatrous (<span class="ital">high places</span>); and exclusion from the altar involved of course exclusion from the priest’s share of the offerings. That <span class="ital">they ate unleavened bread</span> (the attempts to emend this text are unsatisfactory) <span class="ital">with their brethren</span> may imply some peculiar privilege of the priests; yet unleavened bread was not their food alone, and so the phrase more probably means that though shut out from priestly functions the rural Levites were not excommunicated from eating at the Passover, with their brother Levites and other Israelites. Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/44-10.htm" title="And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity....">Ezekiel 44:10-14</a>) excludes ‘Levites’ from the priesthood (confined by him to the sons of Zadok) and degrades them to inferior services about the Temple. We have already seen (on <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a> f.) how this inferiority was confirmed by P.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Rights of the Priests and Levites. - With reference to these, Moses repeats verbatim from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-23.htm">Numbers 18:23-24</a>, the essential part of the rule laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>:"The priests the Levites, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel." "All the tribe of Levi" includes the priests and Levites. They were to eat the "firings of Jehovah and His inheritance," as described in detail in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>. The inheritance of Jehovah consisted of the holy gifts as well as the sacrifices, i.e., the tithes, firstlings, and first-fruits. Moses felt it to be superfluous to enumerate these gifts one by one from the previous laws, and also to describe the mode of their application, or define how much belonged to the priests and how much to the Levites. However true it may be that the author assigns all these gifts to the Levites generally, the conclusion drawn from this, viz., that he was not acquainted with any distinction between priests and Levites, but placed the Levites entirely on a par with the priests, is quite a false one. For, apart from the evident distinction between the priests and Levites in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>, where there would be no meaning in the clause, "all the tribe of Levi," if the Levites were identical with the priests, the distinction is recognised and asserted as clearly as possible in what follows, when a portion of the slain-offerings is allotted to the priests in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3-5</a>, whilst in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-6.htm">Deuteronomy 18:6-8</a> the Levite is allowed to join in eating the altar gifts, if he come to the place of the sanctuary and perform service there. The repetition in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-2.htm">Deuteronomy 18:2</a> is an emphatic confirmation: "As He hath said unto them:" as in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>.</body></html>
