for it is presented as Israel’s continuous defence against the temptation of seeking knowledge of the divine will by the illegitimate methods of divination, soothsaying, necromancy, and the like, which were rampant among the inhabitants of the land. A distant hope of a prophet in the far-off future could afford no motive to shun these superstitions. We cannot understand this passage unless we recognise that the direct reference is to the institution of the prophetic order as the standing means of imparting the reliable knowledge of God’s will, possessing which, Israel had no need to turn to them ‘that peep and mutter’ and bring false oracles from imagined gods. But that primary reference of the words does not exclude, but rather demands, their ultimate reference to Him in whom the divine word is perfectly enshrined, and who is the bright, consummate flower of the prophetic order, which ‘spake of Him,’ not only in its individual predictions, but by its very existence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A glance must be given to the exhaustive list of pretenders to knowledge of the future or to power of shaping it magically, which occurs in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10</a> - <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>, and suggests a terrible picture of the burdens of superstition which weighed on men in these days of ignorance, as the like burdens do still, wherever Jesus is not known as the one Revealer of God, and the sole Lord of all things. Of the eight terms employed, the first three refer to different means of reading the future, the next two to different means of influencing events, and the last three to different ways of consulting the dead. The first of these eight properly refers to drawing lots, but includes other methods; the second is an obscure word, which is supposed by some to mean a ‘murmurer,’ and may refer rather to the low mutterings of the soothsayer than to the method of his working; the third is probably a general expression for an interpreter of omens, especially of those given by the play of liquid in a ‘cup,’ such as Joseph ‘divined’ by.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Two names for magicians follow, of which the former seems to mean one who worked with charms such as African or American Indian ‘medicine men’ use, and the latter, one who binds by incantations, or one who ties magic knots, which are supposed to have the power of hindering the designs of the person against whom they are directed. The word employed means ‘binding,’ and maybe used either literally or metaphorically. The malicious tying of knots in order to work harm is not dead yet in some backward corners of Britain. Then follow three names for traffickers with spirits,-those who raise ghosts as did the witch of Endor, those who have a ‘familiar spirit,’ and those who in any way consult the dead. It is a grim catalogue, bearing witness to the deep-rooted longing in men to peer into the darkness ahead, and to get some knowledge of the purposes of the awful unseen Power who rules there. The longing is here recognised as legitimate, while the methods are branded as bad, and Israel is warned from them, by being pointed to the merciful divine institution which meets the longing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is clear, from this glance at the context, that the ‘prophet’ promised to Israel must mean the order, not the individual; and it is interesting to note, first, the relation in which that order is presented as standing towards all that rabble of diviners and sorcerers, with their rubbish of charms and muttered spells. It sweeps them off the field, because it is truly what they pretend to be. God knows men’s longings, and God will meet them so far as meeting them is for men’s good. But the characteristics of the prophet are set in strong contrast to those of the diviners and magicians, and lift the order high above all the filth and folly of these others. First, the prophet is ‘raised up’ by God; the individual holder of the office has his ‘call’ and does not ‘prophesy out of his own heart.’ The man who takes this office on himself without such a call is <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> branded as a false prophet. Then he is ‘from the midst of thee, of thy brethren,’-springing from the people, not an alien, like so many of these wandering soothsayers, but with the national life throbbing in his veins, and himself participant of the thoughts and emotions of his brethren. Then he is to be ‘like unto’ Moses,-not in all points, but in his receiving direct communications from God, and in his authority as God’s messenger. The crowning characteristic, ‘I will put My words into his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him,’ invests his words with divine authority, calls for obedience to them as the words of God Himself, widens out his sphere far beyond that of merely foretelling, brings in the moral and religious element which had no place in the oracles of the soothsayer, and opens up the prospect of a continuous progressive revelation throughout the ages {‘all that I <span class="ital">shall</span> command him’}. We mutilate the grand idea of the prophet in Israel if we think of his work as mainly prediction, and we mutilate it no less if we exclude prediction from it. We mutilate it still more fatally if we try to account for it on naturalistic principles, and fail to see in the prophet a man directly conscious of a divine call, or to hear in his words the solemn accents of the voice of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The loftiness and the limitations of ‘the goodly fellowship of the prophets’ alike point onwards to Jesus Christ. In Him, and in Him alone, the idea of the prophet is fully realised. The imperfect embodiments of it in the past were prophecies as well as prophets. The fact that God has ‘spoken unto the fathers by the prophets,’ leads us to expect that He will speak ‘to us in a Son,’ and that not by fragments of His mighty voice, but in one full, eternal, all-embracing and all-sufficient Word. Every divine idea, which has been imperfectly manifested in fragmentary and sinful men and in the material creation, is completely incarnated in Him. He is the King to whom the sins and the saintlinesses of Israel’s kings alike pointed. He is the Priest, whom Aaron and his sons foreshadowed, who perfectly exercises the sympathy which they could only feel partially, because they were compassed with infirmity and self-regard, and who offers the true sacrifice of efficacy higher than ‘the blood of bulls and goats.’ He is the Prophet, who makes all other means of knowing the divine will unnecessary, hearing whom we hear the very voice of God speaking in His gentle words of love, in His authoritative words of command, in His illuminating words of wisdom, and speaking yet more loudly and heart-touchingly in the eloquence of deeds no less than divine; who is ‘not ashamed to call us brethren,’ and is ‘bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh’; who is like, but greater than, the great lawgiver of Israel, being the Son and Lord of the ‘house’ in which Moses was but a servant. ‘To Him give all the prophets witness,’ and the greatest of them was honoured when, with Moses, Elijah stood on the Mount of Transfiguration, subordinate and attesting, and then faded away when the voice proclaimed, ‘This is My beloved Son, hear Him,’-and they ‘saw no one save Jesus only.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:9-14 Was it possible that a people so blessed with Divine institutions, should ever be in any danger of making those their teachers whom God had made their captives? They were in danger; therefore, after many like cautions, they are charged not to do after the abominations of the nations of Canaan. All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charms for diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling, &c. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause of the rooting out of the Canaanites. It is amazing to think that there should be any pretenders of this kind in such a land, and day of light, as we live in. They are mere impostors who blind and cheat their followers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony - The Levites had indeed "no part nor inheritance with Israel," but they might individually possess property, and in fact often did so (compare <a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7</a>; <a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>). The Levite who desired to settle at the place of the sanctuary would probably sell his patrimony when quitting his former home.

In this respect his place could be supplied neither by priest nor by king. In the prospect of his demise, therefore, there required to be instituted another office, that of a prophet, one who should be between God and the people, as the channel through which Divine communications might pass to them. This office Moses here announces that God would establish among them when they had entered the Promised Land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The abominations of these nations</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. certain forms of superstitious usage by which the heathen sought to procure the favor of their deities, to obtain from them direction and counsel, and to penetrate into the hidden future of events. Moses charges the people to avoid all such usages, and not even to learn to do after such abominations (cf. <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-23.htm">Numbers 23:23</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26, 31</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"This shall be the right of the priests on the part of the people, on the part of those who slaughter slain-offerings, whether ox or sheep; he (the offerer) shall give the priest the shoulder, the cheek, and the stomach." &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, the shoulder, i.e., the front leg; see <a href="/numbers/6-19.htm">Numbers 6:19</a>. &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;, the rough stomach, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (lxx), i.e., the fourth stomach of ruminant animals, in which the digestion of the food is completed; Lat. omasus or abomasus, though the Vulgate has ventriculus here. On the choice of these three pieces in particular, Mnster and Fagius observe that "the sheep possesses three principal parts, the head, the feet, and the trunk; and of each of these some portion was to be given to the priest who officiated" "Of each of these three principal parts of the animal," says Schultz, "some valuable piece was to be presented: the shoulder at least, and the stomach, which was regarded as particularly fat, are seen at once to have been especially good." That this arrangement is not at variance with the command in <a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>., to give the wave-breast and heave-leg of the peace-offerings to the Lord for the priests, but simply enjoins a further gift to the priests on the part of the people, in addition to those portions which were to be given to the Lord for His servants, is sufficiently evident from the context, since the heave-leg and wave-breast belonged to the firings of Jehovah mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>, which the priests had received as an inheritance from the Lord, that is to say, to the tenuphoth of the children of Israel, which the priests might eat with their sons and daughters, though only with such members of their house as were levitically clean (<a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>); and also from the words of the present command, viz., that the portions mentioned were to be a right of the priests on the part of the people, on the part of those who slaughtered slain-offerings, i.e., to be paid to the priest as a right that was due to him on the part of the people. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; was what the priest could justly claim. This right was probably accorded to the priests as a compensation for the falling off which would take place in their incomes in consequence of the repeal of the law that every animal was to be slaughtered at the sanctuary as a sacrifice (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17.htm">Leviticus 17</a>; vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>.).<p>The only thing that admits of dispute is, whether this gift was to be presented from every animal that was slaughtered at home for private use, or only from those which were slaughtered for sacrificial meals, and therefore at the place of the sanctuary. Against the former view, for which appeal is made to Philo, Josephus (Ant. iv. 4, 4), and the Talmud, we may adduce not only "the difficulty of carrying out such a plan" (was every Israelite who slaughtered an ox, a sheep, or a goat to carry the pieces mentioned to the priests' town, which might be many miles away, or were the priests to appoint persons to collect them?), but the general use of the words &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;. The noun &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; always signifies either slaughtering for a sacrificial meal or a slain sacrifice, and the verb &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; is never applied to ordinary slaughtering (for which &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1496; is the verb used), except in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-21.htm">Deuteronomy 12:21</a> in connection with the repeal of the law that every slaughtering was to be a &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; (<a href="/leviticus/17-5.htm">Leviticus 17:5</a>); and there the use of the word &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;, instead of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1496;, may be accounted for from the allusion to this particular law. At the same time, the Jewish tradition is probably right, when it understands by the &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495; &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497; in this verse, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;' &#787;&#834; &#769; &#787;&#769; &#788;&#769; (Josephus), or &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (Philo), or, as in the Mishnah Chol. (x. 1), refers the gift prescribed in this passage to the &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;, profana, and not to the &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1503;, consecrata, that is to say, places it in the same category with the first-fruits, the tithe of tithes, and other less holy gifts, which might be consumed outside the court of the temple and the holy city (compare Reland, Antiqq. ss. P. ii. c. 4, 11, with P. ii. c. 8, 10). In all probability, the reference is to the slaughtering of oxen, sheep, or goats which were not intended for shelamim in the more limited sense, i.e., for one of the three species of peace-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15-16</a>), but for festal meals in the broader sense, which were held in connection with the sacrificial meals prepared from the shelamim. For it is evident that the meals held by the people at the annual feasts when they had to appear before the Lord were not all shelamim meals, but that other festal meals were held in connection with these, in which the priests and Levites were to share, from the laws laid down with reference to the so-called second tithe, which could not only be turned into money by those who lived at a great distance from the sanctuary, such money to be applied to the purchase of the things required for the sacrificial meals at the place of the sanctuary, but which might also be appropriated every third year to the preparation of love-feasts for the poor in the different towns of the land (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-29</a>). For in this case the animals were not slaughtered or sacrificed as shelamim, at all events not in the latter instance, because the slaughtering did not take place at the sanctuary. If therefore we restrict the gift prescribed here to the slaughtering of oxen and sheep or goats for such sacrificial meals in the wider sense, not only are the difficulties connected with the execution of this command removed, but also the objection, which arises out of the general use of the expression &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;, to the application of this expression to every slaughtering that took place for domestic use. And beside this, the passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13-16</a>, to which Calvin calls attention, furnishes a historical proof that the priests could claim a portion of the flesh of the slain-offerings in addition to the heave-leg and wave-breast, since it is there charged as a sin on the part of the sons of Eli, not only that they took out of the cauldrons as much of the flesh which was boiling as they could take up with three-pronged forks, but that before the fat was burned upon the altar they asked for the pieces which belonged to the priest, to be given to them not cooked, but raw. From this Michaelis has drawn the correct conclusion, that even at that time the priests had a right to claim that, in addition to the portions of the sacrifices appointed by Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-34.htm">Leviticus 7:34</a>, a further portion of the thank-offerings should be given to them; though he does not regard the passage as referring to the law before us, since he supposes this to relate to every slaughtered animal which was not placed upon the altar.</body></html>
