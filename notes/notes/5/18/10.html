They were in danger; therefore, after many like cautions, they are charged not to do after the abominations of the nations of Canaan. All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charms for diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling, &c. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause of the rooting out of the Canaanites. It is amazing to think that there should be any pretenders of this kind in such a land, and day of light, as we live in.

To Moloch, which was a sort of lustration by fire, two fires being made, and the child led by a priest between them, and which was an initiation of him into the religion of that deity, and devoting him to it; so Jarchi says, this is the service of Moloch, making piles of fire here and there (on this side and on that), and causing (the children) to pass between them both. Besides this they used to burn them with fire to this deity, perhaps after the performance of this ceremony; see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, or that useth divination: according to Aben Ezra this is a general name, and so Ben Melech, the particulars of which are what follow: <p>an observer of times, &amp;c. Cicero says (z), there are two sorts of divination, one is of art, the other of nature. What nation or what city is not moved by prediction, either by the entrails of beasts, or of those that interpret strange things and lightnings, or of soothsayers, or astrologers, or of lots (for these are mostly of art); or of dreams or prophecies, for these two are thought to be natural? Again he says (a), the Phrygians, Pisidians, and Cilicians, pay a great respect to the signs of birds--from the beginning of the world it was that certain signs were forerunners of certain things; some in the entrails of beasts, some in birds, others in lightnings, others in marvellous things, others in the stars; some in visions and dreams, and others in the words of frantic persons. So the comedian remarks (b), that if a strange black dog comes into a house, or a snake falls from the tiles through rain, or a hen crows, these, are observed as ominous, by the diviner or soothsayer. Porphyry says (c), that soothsayers divine by the noise of crows and ravens; and it is said (d) the Arabians, from birds as from oracles, divine what shall come to pass; and that they attain to, as they say, by eating the heart and liver of dragons. Jarchi on this place asks, who is the diviner? one that lays hold on his staff, and says, shall I go? or shall I not go? that is, to such a place; and according as it fell, so judgment was made; see <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>. Now such sort of diviners and divinations are cautioned against, as not to be admitted among the people of Israel, and regarded by them: <p>or an observer of times: and such things the Egyptians were very inquisitive about, what month or day belonged to the gods, what day any one was born on, what shall befall him, how he will die, and what he shall be, as Herodotus (e) relates; and such are they who are here meant, according to R. Akiba (f) that count times and hours, and say such a time is beautiful (or seasonable) to go out in and trade; but the wise men say, as Jarchi observes, these are they that hold the eyes, cast a mist over people's eyes, that they cannot perceive their juggling tricks. Some think the word has the signification of clouds, and so designs such that observed them and their motions, and made their conclusions according to them; see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>, <p>or an enchanter; according to Jarchi, one that remarks things as ominous; as when a morsel falls out of a man's mouth, a roe stops him in the way, or his staff falls out of his hands: the word has the signification of a serpent in it, and so may signify one that enchants them; see <a href="/psalms/58-4.htm">Psalm 58:4</a> or makes observations by them, as portending this and that, and the other, as before observed of the snake falling from the tiles; and Horace (g) speaks of a serpent lying in the way, and frightening horses, as taken notice of by soothsayers: <p>or a witch; of whom see <a href="/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>. <p>(z) De Divinatione, l. 1. c. 8.

The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>) is part of a verb which signifies to cover, to use covert arts, to practice sorcery; though some derive it from the noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, a thick cloud, and explain it as "interpreter of clouds;" while others trace it to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, the eye, and explain it as "one who cheats by optical fascinations" (so the Syriac, <span class="accented">fascinans oculis</span>), or one who divines by inspection - an augur." <span class="cmt_word">An enchanter</span>; one who practices magic, or divines by signs (cf. <a href="/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-1.htm">Numbers 24:1</a>). It is sometimes said that the verb of which this word is a part (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, a serpent; whence it is inferred that the species of divination indicated by this word is <span class="accented">ophiomancy</span>, or divination by serpents, but this is not generally accepted by scholars. <span class="cmt_word">A witch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">maleficus</span>); probably one who pretended to cure diseases, or procure some desired result, by means of nostrums and philtres. In the enumeration of the wise men of Babylon (<a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), the Mecashephim have a place beside the Hartummim, and in <a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a> and <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, they are joined with the Hachamim or Magi of Egypt; and this favors the conclusion that their sorcery had a quasi-scientific basis. The English word "witch" is now restricted to the <span class="accented">female</span> practicer of unlawful arts; formerly it was applied to <span class="accented">males</span> as well, if not chiefly (Trench, 'Select Glossary,' p. 806). <span class="cmt_word">A charmer</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>); a dealer in spells, one who by means of spells or charms pretends to achieve some desired result. The verb here used primarily means to bind, and the species of magic indicated is probably that practiced by binding certain knots, whereby it was supposed that the curse or blessing, as the case might he, was bound on its object; this was accompanied apparently with incantation (<a href="/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>). Comp. English <span class="accented">spell-bound</span>, and the phrase, "to rivet charms" (Jonson, 'Sad Shepherd,' 2:2). A species of incantation known to the Romans consisted in tying knots with threads of different colors, three in number, which were supposed to become a bond to secure an object (cf. Virg., 'Eclog.' 8:76, 77). <span class="cmt_word">A consulter with familiar spirits.</span> This phrase conveys something different from what is expressed, in the Hebrew. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> is one who asks or inquires of an Ob, that is, a Python, or divining spirit. This spirit was supposed to be in the person of the conjurer, and to be able to reveal to him what was secret or hidden in the future (<a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7, 8</a>; <a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>). The notion of "a familiar spirit," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a spirit not dwelling in the person, but with which he is intimate - generally the spirit of one who formerly lived on earth - is a modern notion not known to Scripture. The persons here referred to were probably ventriloquists (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), and used their faculty in this respect for purposes of magic, pretending that they had within them a spirit which they could consult, and by which they could predict what would happen or reveal what was hid. <span class="cmt_word">Wizard</span>. The English word "wizard" did not originally convey the idea of anything evil in the person of whom it was used; Milton applies it to the Magi who came to worship at Bethlehem ('Ode on the Nativity,' 4.); it meant merely "the wise one," or "the knowing one;" and thus is an exact equivalent for the Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, knowing, wise, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, to know). <span class="cmt_word">A necromancer</span>; one who professed to call up the dead, and from them to learn the secrets of futurity (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>).
