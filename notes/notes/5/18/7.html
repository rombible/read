Care is likewise taken that they want not the comforts and conveniences of this life. The people must provide for them. He that has the benefit of solemn religious assemblies, ought to give help for the comfortable support of those that minister in such assemblies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses presuppose that part of the Levites only will be in residence and officiating at the place of the sanctuary, the others of course dwelling at their own homes in the Levitical cities, or "sojourning" elsewhere; compare the marginal references. But if any Levite out of love for the service of the sanctuary chose to resort to it when he might reside in his own home, he was to have his share in the maintenance which was provided for those ministering in the order of their course.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. if a Levite &#8230; come with all the desire of his mind&#8212;It appears that the Levites served in rotation from the earliest times; but, from their great numbers, it was only at infrequent intervals they could be called into actual service. Should any Levite, however, under the influence of eminent piety, resolve to devote himself wholly and continually to the sacred duties of the sanctuary, he was allowed to realize his ardent wishes; and as he was admitted to a share of the work, so also to a share of the remuneration. Though he might have private property, that was to form no ground for withholding or even diminishing his claim to maintenance like the other ministering priests. The reason or principle of the enactment is obvious (1Co 9:13). At the same time, while every facility was afforded for the admission of such a zealous and self-denying officer, this admission was to be in an orderly manner: he was to minister "as all his brethren"&#8212;that is, a Gershonite with Gershonites; a Merarite with Merarites; so that there might be no derangement of the established courses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God,.... The Targum of Jonathan is,"he shall minister in the name of the Word of the Lord his God;''in the name of Christ, as a type of him, as every priest and every sacrifice were: he was to be allowed to officiate, though it was not his course or turn: <p>as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the Lord; daily offering the same sacrifices, and whatsoever are brought unto them; who might be said to stand before the Lord, because they stood at the altar of the Lord, and offered the sacrifices of the people to him; and a country Levite or priest was to be admitted to do the same thing at Jerusalem, and in the temple there, as they did; and this shows that a priest is meant by the Levite. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">then he shall minister</span>] See on <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>. If he comes to the one place at which sacrifice is valid, the rural Levite may discharge the priestly office equally with the Levites who already minister there.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Rights of the Priests and Levites. - With reference to these, Moses repeats verbatim from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-23.htm">Numbers 18:23-24</a>, the essential part of the rule laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>:"The priests the Levites, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel." "All the tribe of Levi" includes the priests and Levites. They were to eat the "firings of Jehovah and His inheritance," as described in detail in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>. The inheritance of Jehovah consisted of the holy gifts as well as the sacrifices, i.e., the tithes, firstlings, and first-fruits. Moses felt it to be superfluous to enumerate these gifts one by one from the previous laws, and also to describe the mode of their application, or define how much belonged to the priests and how much to the Levites. However true it may be that the author assigns all these gifts to the Levites generally, the conclusion drawn from this, viz., that he was not acquainted with any distinction between priests and Levites, but placed the Levites entirely on a par with the priests, is quite a false one. For, apart from the evident distinction between the priests and Levites in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>, where there would be no meaning in the clause, "all the tribe of Levi," if the Levites were identical with the priests, the distinction is recognised and asserted as clearly as possible in what follows, when a portion of the slain-offerings is allotted to the priests in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3-5</a>, whilst in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-6.htm">Deuteronomy 18:6-8</a> the Levite is allowed to join in eating the altar gifts, if he come to the place of the sanctuary and perform service there. The repetition in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-2.htm">Deuteronomy 18:2</a> is an emphatic confirmation: "As He hath said unto them:" as in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>.</body></html>
