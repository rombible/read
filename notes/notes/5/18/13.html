All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charms for diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling, &c. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause of the rooting out of the Canaanites.

The instinct was sound. That such practices divert men from the rational and ethical elements of religion and weaken both the judgement and will of those who resort to them is notorious in the history of modern spiritualism.

The verb &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (sojourned) does not presuppose that the Levites were houseless, but simply that they had no hereditary possession in the land as the other tribes had, and merely lived like sojourners among the Israelites in the towns which were given up to them by the other tribes (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>). "All his brethren the Levites" are the priests and those Levites who officiated at the sanctuary as assistants to the priests. It is assumed, therefore, that only a part of the Levites were engaged at the sanctuary, and the others lived in their towns. The apodosis follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-8.htm">Deuteronomy 18:8</a>, "part like part shall they eat," sc., the new-comer and those already there. The former was to have the same share to eat as the latter, and to be maintained from the revenues of the sanctuary. These revenues are supposed to be already apportioned by the previous laws, so that they by no means abolish the distinction between priests and Levites. We are not to think of those portions of the sacrifices and first-fruits only which fell to the lot of the priests, nor of the tithe alone, or of the property which flowed into the sanctuary through vows or free-will offerings, or in any other way, and was kept in the treasury and storehouse, but of tithes, sacrificial portions, and free-will offerings generally, which were not set apart exclusively for the priests. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1500;&#1489;&#1491;, "beside his sold with the fathers," i.e., independently of what he receives from the sale of his patrimony. &#1502;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, the sale, then the thing sold, and the price or produce of what is sold, like &#1502;&#1499;&#1512; in <a href="/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a>. &#1500;&#1489;&#1491; is unusual without &#1502;&#1503;, and Knobel would read &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, from &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; and &#1502;&#1503;, in consequence. &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; stands for &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500; (see at <a href="/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, lxx), according to or with the fathers' houses, i.e., the produce of the property which he possesses according to his family descent, or which is with his kindred. Whether &#1506;&#1500; in this passage signifies "according to the measure of," or "with," in the sense of keeping or administering, cannot be decided. As the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-33.htm">Leviticus 25:33-34</a>, simply forbids the sale of the pasture grounds belonging to the Levites, but permits the sale of their houses, a Levite who went to the sanctuary might either let his property in the Levitical town, and draw the yearly rent, or sell the house which belonged to him there. In any case, these words furnish a convincing proof that there is no foundation for the assertion that the book of Deuteronomy assumes or affirms that the Levites were absolutely without possessions. </body></html>
