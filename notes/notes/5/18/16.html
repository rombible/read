He is the Light of the world, Joh 8:12. He is the World by whom God speaks to us, Joh 1:1; Heb 1:2. In his birth he should be one of their nation. In his resurrection he should be raised up at Jerusalem, and from thence his doctrine should go forth to all the world. Thus God, having raised up his Son Christ Jesus, sent him to bless us. He should be like unto Moses, only above him. This prophet is come, even JESUS; and is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. The view of God which he gives, will not terrify or overwhelm, but encourages us. He speaks with fatherly affection and Divine authority united. Whoever refuses to listen to Jesus Christ, shall find it is at his peril; the same that is the Prophet is to be his Judge, Joh 12:48. Woe then to those who refuse to hearken to His voice, to accept His salvation, or yield obedience to His sway! But happy they who trust in Him, and obey Him. He will lead them in the paths of safety and peace, until He brings them to the land of perfect light, purity, and happiness. Here is a caution against false prophets. It highly concerns us to have a right touchstone wherewith to try the word we hear, that we may know what that word is which the Lord has not spoken. Whatever is against the plain sense of the written word, or which gives countenance or encouragement to sin, we may be sure is not that which the Lord has spoken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The ancient fathers of the Church and the generality of modern commentators have regarded our Lord as the prophet promised in these verses. It is evident from the New Testament alone that the Messianic was the accredited interpretation among the Jews at the beginning of the Christian era (compare the marginal references, and <a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>); nor can our Lord Himself, when He declares that Moses "wrote of Him" <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45-47</a>, be supposed to have any other words more directly in view than these, the only words in which Moses, speaking in his own person, gives any prediction of the kind. But the verses seem to have a further, no less evident if subsidiary, reference to a prophetical order which should stand from time to time, as Moses had done, between God and the people; which should make known God's will to the latter; which should by its presence render it unnecessary either that God should address the people directly, as at Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-16.htm">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>; compare <a href="/deuteronomy/5-25.htm">Deuteronomy 5:25</a> ff), or that the people themselves in lack of counsel should resort to the superstitions of the pagan.<p>In fact, in the words before us, Moses gives promise both of a prophetic order, and of the Messiah in particular as its chief; of a line of prophets culminating in one eminent individual. And in proportion as we see in our Lord the characteristics of the prophet most perfectly exhibited, so must we regard the promise of Moses as in Him most completely accomplished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>De 18:15-19. Christ the Prophet Is to Be Heard.<p>15-19. The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet&#8212;The insertion of this promise, in connection with the preceding prohibition, might warrant the application (which some make of it) to that order of true prophets whom God commissioned in unbroken succession to instruct, to direct, and warn His people; and in this view the purport of it is, "There is no need to consult with diviners and soothsayers, as I shall afford you the benefit of divinely appointed prophets, for judging of whose credentials a sure criterion is given" (De 18:20-22). But the prophet here promised was pre-eminently the Messiah, for He alone was "like unto Moses" (see on [156]De 34:10) "in His mediatorial character; in the peculiar excellence of His ministry; in the number, variety, and magnitude of His miracles; in His close and familiar communion with God; and in His being the author of a new dispensation of religion." This prediction was fulfilled fifteen hundred years afterwards and was expressly applied to Jesus Christ by Peter (Ac 3:22, 23), and by Stephen (Ac 7:37).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the day of the assembly, </span> to wit, of that great and general congregation of all the people together. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>According to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God at Horeb,....

But if the covenant fellowship with Himself and His grace, in which Jehovah had placed Israel as His people of possession, was to be manifested and preserved as a living reality amidst all changes in the political development of the nation and in the circumstances of private life, it would not do for the revelations from God to cease with the giving of the law and the death of Moses. For, as Schultz observes, "however the revelation of the law might aim at completeness, and even have regard to the more remote circumstances of the future, as, for example, where the king is referred to; yet in the transition from extraordinary circumstances into a more settled condition, which it foretells in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, and which actually took place under Samuel when the nation grew older (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-25.htm">Deuteronomy 4:25</a>), and in the decline and apostasy which certainly awaited it according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-29</a>, when false prophets should arise, by whom they were in danger of being led astray (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-2.htm">Deuteronomy 13:2</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>), as well as in the restoration which would follow after the infliction of punishment (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29-30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1</a>.); in all these great changes which awaited Israel from inward necessity, the revelation of the will of the Lord which they possessed in the law would nevertheless be insufficient." The priesthood, with its ordinances, would not suffice for that. As the promise of direct communications from God through the Urim and Thummim of the high priest was restricted to the single circumstance of the right of the whole congregation being endangered, and did not extend to the satisfaction of the religious necessities of individuals, it could afford no godly satisfaction to that desire for supernatural knowledge which arose at times in the hearts of individuals, and for which the heathen oracles made such ample provision in ungodly ways. If Israel therefore was to be preserved in faithfulness towards God, and attain the end of its calling as the congregation of the Lord, it was necessary that the Lord should make known His counsel and will at the proper time through the medium of prophets, and bestow upon it in sure prophetic words what the heathen nations endeavoured to discover and secure by means of augury and soothsaying. This is the point of view from which Moses promises the sending of prophets in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-18</a>, and lays down in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19-22</a> the criteria for distinguishing between true and false prophets, as we may clearly see from the fact that in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-14</a> he introduces this promise with a warning against resorting to heathen augury, soothsaying, and witchcraft.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-11</a><p>When Israel came into the land of Canaan, it was "not to learn to do like the abominations of these nations" (the Canaanites or heathen). There was not to be found in it any who caused his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, i.e., any worshipper of Moloch (see at <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>), or one who practised soothsaying (see at <a href="/numbers/23-23.htm">Numbers 23:23</a>), or a wizard (see at <a href="/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>), or a snake-charmer (see at <a href="/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>), or a conjurer, or one who pronounced a ban (&#1495;&#1489;&#1512; &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, probably referring to the custom of binding or banning by magical knots), a necromancer and wise man (see at <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>), or one who asked the dead, i.e., who sought oracles from the dead. Moses groups together all the words which the language contained for the different modes of exploring the future and discovering the will of God, for the purpose of forbidding every description of soothsaying, and places the prohibition of Moloch-worship at the head, to show the inward connection between soothsaying and idolatry, possibly because februation, or passing children through the fire in the worship of Moloch, was more intimately connected with soothsaying and magic than and other description of idolatry.</body></html>
