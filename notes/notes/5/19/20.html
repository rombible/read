A curse was to be pronounced upon the remover of landmarks, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>, just as upon one who cursed his father, who led a blind man astray, or perverted the rights of orphans and widows (cf. <a href="/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-10.htm">Proverbs 23:10</a>). Landmarks were regarded as sacred among other nations also; by the Romans, for example, they were held to be so sacred, that whoever removed them was to be put to death. </body></html>
