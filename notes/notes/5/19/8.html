This the Jewish writers themselves own. “Yet the holy blessed God,” say they, “did not command it in vain, for in the days of Messiah the Prince, they shall be added.” They expect it in the letter: but we know it has in Christ its spiritual accomplishment. For the borders of the gospel Israel are enlarged according to the promise: and in the Lord our righteousness, refuge is provided for all that by faith flee to him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-13 Here is the law settled between the blood of the murdered, and the blood of the murderer; provision is made, that the cities of refuge should be a protection, so that a man should not die for that as a crime, which was not his willing act.

And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy coast&#8212;Three additional sanctuaries were to be established in the event of their territory extending over the country from Hermon and Gilead to the Euphrates (see Ge 15:18; Ex 23:31). But it was obscurely hinted that this last provision would never be carried into effect, as the Israelites would not fulfil the conditions, namely, "that of keeping the commandments, to love the Lord, and walk ever in his ways." In point of fact, although that region was brought into subjection by David and Solomon, we do not find that cities of refuge were established; because those sovereigns only made the ancient inhabitants tributary, instead of sending a colony of Israelites to possess it. The privilege of sanctuary cities, however, was given only for Israelites; and besides, that conquered territory did not remain long under the power of the Hebrew kings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Enlarge thy coast, </span> as far as Euphrates.

For further remarks on this point, as well as with regard to the use of these cities (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">Deuteronomy 19:4-7</a>), see at <a href="/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-8.htm">Deuteronomy 19:8-10</a> there follow the fresh instructions, that if the Lord should extend the borders of Israel, according to His promise given to the patriarchs, and should give them the whole land from the Nile to the Euphrates, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, they were to add three other cities of refuge to these three, for the purpose of preventing the shedding of innocent blood. The three new cities of refuge cannot be the three appointed in <a href="/numbers/35-14.htm">Numbers 35:14</a> for the land on this side of the Jordan, nor the three mentioned in <a href="/numbers/35-7.htm">Numbers 35:7</a> on the other side of Jordan, as Knobel and others suppose. Nor can we adopt Hengstenberg's view, that the three new ones are the same as the three mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-2.htm">Deuteronomy 19:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-7.htm">Deuteronomy 19:7</a>, since they are expressly distinguished from "these three." The meaning is altogether a different one. The circumstances supposed by Moses never existed, since the Israelites did not fulfil the conditions laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-9.htm">Deuteronomy 19:9</a>, viz., that they should keep the law faithfully, and love the Lord their God (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, etc.). The extension of the power of Israel to the Euphrates under David and Solomon, did not bring the land as far as this river into their actual possession, since the conquered kingdoms of Aram were still inhabited by the Aramaeans, who, though conquered, were only rendered tributary. And the Tyrians and Phoenicians, who belonged to the Canaanitish population, were not even attacked by David.</body></html>
