For further remarks on this point, as well as with regard to the use of these cities (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">Deuteronomy 19:4-7</a>), see at <a href="/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-8.htm">Deuteronomy 19:8-10</a> there follow the fresh instructions, that if the Lord should extend the borders of Israel, according to His promise given to the patriarchs, and should give them the whole land from the Nile to the Euphrates, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, they were to add three other cities of refuge to these three, for the purpose of preventing the shedding of innocent blood. The three new cities of refuge cannot be the three appointed in <a href="/numbers/35-14.htm">Numbers 35:14</a> for the land on this side of the Jordan, nor the three mentioned in <a href="/numbers/35-7.htm">Numbers 35:7</a> on the other side of Jordan, as Knobel and others suppose. Nor can we adopt Hengstenberg's view, that the three new ones are the same as the three mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-2.htm">Deuteronomy 19:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-7.htm">Deuteronomy 19:7</a>, since they are expressly distinguished from "these three." The meaning is altogether a different one. The circumstances supposed by Moses never existed, since the Israelites did not fulfil the conditions laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-9.htm">Deuteronomy 19:9</a>, viz., that they should keep the law faithfully, and love the Lord their God (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, etc.). The extension of the power of Israel to the Euphrates under David and Solomon, did not bring the land as far as this river into their actual possession, since the conquered kingdoms of Aram were still inhabited by the Aramaeans, who, though conquered, were only rendered tributary. And the Tyrians and Phoenicians, who belonged to the Canaanitish population, were not even attacked by David.</body></html>
