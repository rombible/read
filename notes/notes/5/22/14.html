So far was it from being unworthy of God to leave such things upon record, that the enactments must heighten our admiration of His wisdom and goodness in the management of a people so perverse and so given to irregular passions. Nor is it a better argument that the Scriptures were not written by inspiration of God to object that this passage, and others of a like nature, tend to corrupt the imagination and will be abused by evil-disposed readers, than it is to say that the sun was not created by God, because its light may be abused by wicked men as an assistant in committing crimes which they have meditated [Horne].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of speech, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of words</span>, i.e. of discourses or defamations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And give occasions of speech against her,....

This is the charge in court against her, the action laid by him; so Jarchi observes, a man might not say this but before a magistrate, in a court of judicature, which is thus represented by Maimonides (p);"a man comes to the sanhedrim, and says, this young woman I married, and I did not find her virginities; and when I inquired into the matter, it appeared to me that she had played the whore under me, after I had betrothed her; and these are my witnesses that she played the whore before them.'' <p>(p) Hilchot Naarah Betulah, c. 3. sect. 6. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And give <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:</span><p>(g) That is, be an occasion that she is slandered.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">and lay shameful things to her charge</span>] So some versions, and so still Marti.
