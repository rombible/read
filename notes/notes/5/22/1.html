The duty inculcated is an act of common justice and charity, which, while it was taught by the law of nature, was more clearly and forcibly enjoined in the law delivered by God to His people. Indifference or dissimulation in the circumstances supposed would not only be cruelty to the dumb animals, but a violation of the common rights of humanity; and therefore the dictates of natural feeling, and still more the authority of the divine law, enjoined that the lost or missing property of another should be taken care of by the finder, till a proper opportunity occurred of restoring it to the owner.Laws about stray cattle, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/deuteronomy/22-1.htm" title="You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall in any case bring them again to your brother....">Deu 22:1-3</a></span>.
