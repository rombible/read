The sin of seduction before marriage is punished by a heavy fine. We have recently amended our own laws in the direction of this very precept. But the fact that marriage was made compulsory in these cases makes the Law stricter still. It seems, however, from <a href="/exodus/22-17.htm" title="If her father utterly refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.">Exodus 22:17</a>, that the <span class= "ital">girl’s father </span>might forbid the marriage, though the seducer could not escape from it in any other way.<p>(30) See <a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm" title="The nakedness of your father, or the nakedness of your mother, shall you not uncover: she is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.">Leviticus 18:7</a>.

If a man take a wife, &c.&#8212;The regulations that follow might be imperatively needful in the then situation of the Israelites; and yet, it is not necessary that we should curiously and impertinently inquire into them. So far was it from being unworthy of God to leave such things upon record, that the enactments must heighten our admiration of His wisdom and goodness in the management of a people so perverse and so given to irregular passions. Nor is it a better argument that the Scriptures were not written by inspiration of God to object that this passage, and others of a like nature, tend to corrupt the imagination and will be abused by evil-disposed readers, than it is to say that the sun was not created by God, because its light may be abused by wicked men as an assistant in committing crimes which they have meditated [Horne].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. An unmarried man, as appears, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
