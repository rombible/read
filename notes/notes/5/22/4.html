Of Humanity toward Brethren.<p>1. Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them, &c.&#8212;"Brother" is a term of extensive application, comprehending persons of every description; not a relative, neighbor, or fellow countryman only, but any human being, known or unknown, a foreigner, and even an enemy (Ex 23:4). The duty inculcated is an act of common justice and charity, which, while it was taught by the law of nature, was more clearly and forcibly enjoined in the law delivered by God to His people. Indifference or dissimulation in the circumstances supposed would not only be cruelty to the dumb animals, but a violation of the common rights of humanity; and therefore the dictates of natural feeling, and still more the authority of the divine law, enjoined that the lost or missing property of another should be taken care of by the finder, till a proper opportunity occurred of restoring it to the owner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Help him, </span> i.e. thy brother, the owner.

By this the right was taken away from the parents of putting an incorrigible son to death (cf. <a href="/proverbs/19-18.htm">Proverbs 19:18</a>), whilst at the same time the parental authority was fully preserved. Nothing is said about any evidence of the charge brought by the parents, or about any judicial inquiry generally. "In such a case the charge was a proof in itself. For if the heart of a father and mother could be brought to such a point as to give up their child to the judge before the community of the nation, everything would have been done that a judge would need to know" (Schnell, d. isr.
