Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them, &c.&#8212;"Brother" is a term of extensive application, comprehending persons of every description; not a relative, neighbor, or fellow countryman only, but any human being, known or unknown, a foreigner, and even an enemy (Ex 23:4). The duty inculcated is an act of common justice and charity, which, while it was taught by the law of nature, was more clearly and forcibly enjoined in the law delivered by God to His people. Indifference or dissimulation in the circumstances supposed would not only be cruelty to the dumb animals, but a violation of the common rights of humanity; and therefore the dictates of natural feeling, and still more the authority of the divine law, enjoined that the lost or missing property of another should be taken care of by the finder, till a proper opportunity occurred of restoring it to the owner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If thy brother be not nigh unto thee, </span> which may make the duty more troublesome or chargeable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If thou know him not; </span> which implies, that if they did know the owner, they should restore it to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, </span> to be used like thine own cattle.

If any one's son was unmanageable and refractory, not hearkening to the voice of his parents, even when they chastised him, his father and mother were to take him and lead him out to the elders of the town into the gate of the place. The elders are not regarded here as judges in the strict sense of the word, but as magistrates, who had to uphold the parental authority, and administer the local police. The gate of the town was the forum, where the public affairs of the place were discussed (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7</a>); as it is in the present day in Syria (Seetzen, R. ii. p. 88), and among the Moors (Hst, Nachrichten v. Marokkos, p. 239). </body></html>
