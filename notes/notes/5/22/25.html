So far was it from being unworthy of God to leave such things upon record, that the enactments must heighten our admiration of His wisdom and goodness in the management of a people so perverse and so given to irregular passions. Nor is it a better argument that the Scriptures were not written by inspiration of God to object that this passage, and others of a like nature, tend to corrupt the imagination and will be abused by evil-disposed readers, than it is to say that the sun was not created by God, because its light may be abused by wicked men as an assistant in committing crimes which they have meditated [Horne].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The man force her; </span> which was to be examined and determined by the consideration of all the circumstances. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field,....
