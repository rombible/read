It is good for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame, our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath and the curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, that it will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancy that our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord, though in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. But when the secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth at the day of judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. At present, One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted, but died upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach, though self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and for eternal life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory, all the glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal reference. Taberah was the name of a spot in or near the station of Kibroth-hattaavah, and accordingly is not named in the list of encampments given in <a href="/numbers/33-16.htm">Numbers 33:16</a>. The separate mention of the two is, however, appropriate here, for each place and each name was a memorial of an act of rebellion.

But on a comparison of this passage with Nu 14:5, the subject and language of this prayer show that only the second act of intercession (De 9:18) is now described in fuller detail.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Through thy greatness, </span> i.e. through the greatness of thy power, which appeared most eminently in that work, as is noted, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/9-29.htm" title="Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your stretched out arm.">Deu 9:29</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I prayed therefore unto the Lord,....

Moses pleaded with God not to destroy that people which was his own, which he had redeemed for himself and brought out of Egypt; besought him to remember their pious ancestors, and not to look on the stubbornness and sin of the people; and urged that the Divine honor was concerned in their being conducted to Canaan, and not let perish in the wilderness. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It was not from the people only, but from Aaron also, that Moses averted the wrath of God through his intercession, when it was about to destroy him. In the historical account in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, there is no special reference to this intercession, as it is included in the intercession for the whole nation. On the present occasion, however, Moses gave especial prominence to this particular feature, not only that he might make the people thoroughly aware that at that time Israel could not even boast of the righteousness of its eminent men (cf. <a href="/isaiah/43-27.htm">Isaiah 43:27</a>), but also to bring out the fact, which is described still more fully in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>., that Aaron's investiture with the priesthood, and the maintenance of this institution, was purely a work of divine grace. It is true that at that time Aaron was not yet high priest; but he had been placed at the head of the nation in connection with Hur, as the representative of Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-14.htm">Exodus 24:14</a>), and was already designated by God for the high-priesthood (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). The fact, however, that Aaron had drawn upon himself the wrath of God in a very high degree, was intimated plainly enough in what Moses told him in <a href="/exodus/32-21.htm">Exodus 32:21</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>, Moses mentions again how he destroyed that manifested sin of the nation, namely, the molten calf (see at <a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>).</body></html>
