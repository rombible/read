It is good for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame, our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath and the curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, that it will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancy that our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord, though in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. But when the secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth at the day of judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. At present, One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted, but died upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach, though self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and for eternal life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory, all the glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal reference. Taberah was the name of a spot in or near the station of Kibroth-hattaavah, and accordingly is not named in the list of encampments given in <a href="/numbers/33-16.htm">Numbers 33:16</a>. The separate mention of the two is, however, appropriate here, for each place and each name was a memorial of an act of rebellion. The instances in this and the next verse are not given in order of occurrence. The speaker for his own purposes advances from the slighter to the more heinous proofs of guilt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

But on a comparison of this passage with Nu 14:5, the subject and language of this prayer show that only the second act of intercession (De 9:18) is now described in fuller detail.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Forty days and forty nights; </span> the same mentioned before, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/9-18.htm" title="And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">Deu 9:18</a></span>, as appears, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The reference is to the intercession before Moses came down from the mount, described in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>. (For the form of the expression, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-46.htm">Deuteronomy 1:46</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses went up the mountain, and stayed there forty days, entirely occupied with the holiest things, so that he neither ate nor drank, having gone up to receive the tables of the law, upon which the words were written with the finger of God, just as the Lord had spoken them directly to the people out of the midst of the fire, - at a time, therefore, when the Israelites should also have been meditating deeply upon the words of the Lord which they had but just heard, - they acted so corruptly, as to depart at once from the way that had been pointed out, and make themselves a molten image (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18-32:6</a>, with chs. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-12.htm">Deuteronomy 24:12-31:17</a>). "The day of the assembly," i.e., the day on which Moses gathered the people together before God (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>), calling them out of the camp, and bringing them to the Lord to the foot of Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>). The construction of the sentence is this: the apodosis to "when I was gone up" commences with "the Lord delivered unto me," in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>; and the clause, "then I abode," etc., in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>, is a parenthesis. - The words of God in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12-14</a> are taken almost word for word from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-7.htm">Exodus 32:7-10</a>. &#1492;&#1512;&#1507; (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-14.htm">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>), the imperative Hiphil of &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, desist from me, that I may destroy them, for &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492;, in <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>. But notwithstanding the apostasy of the people, the Lord gave Moses the tables of the covenant, not only that they might be a testimony of His holiness before the faithless nation, but still more as a testimony that, in spite of His resolution to destroy the rebellious nation, without leaving a trace behind, He would still uphold His covenant, and make of Moses a greater people. There is nothing at all to favour the opinion, that handing over the tables (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-11.htm">Deuteronomy 9:11</a>) was the first beginning of the manifestations of divine wrath (Schultz); and this is also at variance with the preterite, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-11.htm">Deuteronomy 9:11</a>, from which it is very evident that the Lord had already given the tables to Moses, when He commanded him to go down quickly, not only to declare to the people the holiness of God, but to stop the apostasy, and by his mediatorial intervention to avert from the people the execution of the divine purpose. It is true, that when Moses came down and saw the idolatrous conduct of the people, he threw the two tables from his hands, and broke them in pieces before the eyes of the people (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15-17</a>; comp. with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15-19</a>), as a practical declaration that the covenant of the Lord was broken by their apostasy. But this act of Moses furnishes no proof that the Lord had given him the tables to declare His holy wrath in the sight of the people. And even if the tables of the covenant were "in a certain sense the indictments in Moses' hands, accusing them of a capital crime" (Schultz), this was not the purpose for which God had given them to him. For if it had been, Moses would not have broken them in pieces, destroying, as it were, the indictments themselves, before the people had been tried. Moses passed over the fact, that even before coming down from the mountain he endeavoured to mitigate the wrath of the Lord by his intercession (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>), and simply mentioned (in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15-17</a>) how, as soon as he came down, he charged the people with their great sin; and then, in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-19.htm">Deuteronomy 9:19</a>, how he spent another forty days upon the mountain fasting before God, on account of this sin, until he had averted the destructive wrath of the Lord from Israel, through his earnest intercession. The forty days that Moses spent upon the mountain, "as at the first," in prayer before the Lord, are the days mentioned in <a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a> as having been passed upon Sinai for the perfect restoration of the covenant, and for the purpose of procuring the second tables (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1</a>.).</body></html>
