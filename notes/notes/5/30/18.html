Every man wishes to obtain life and good, and to escape death and evil; he desires happiness, and dreads misery. So great is the compassion of the Lord, that he has favoured men, by his word, with such a knowledge of good and evil as will make them for ever happy, if it be not their own fault. Let us hear the sum of the whole matter. If they and theirs would love God, and serve him, they should live and be happy. If they or theirs should turn from God, desert his service, and worship other gods, that would certainly be their ruin. There never was, since the fall of man, more than one way to heaven; which is marked out in both Testaments, though not with equal clearness. Moses meant that same way of acceptance, which Paul more plainly described; and Paul's words mean the same obedience, on which Moses more fully treated. In both Testaments the good and right way is brought near, and plainly revealed to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In thy mouth, and in, thy heart - Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18-20</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>De 30:15-20.

Love of God and compliance with His will are the only ways of securing the blessings and avoiding the evils described. The choice was left to them, and in urging upon them the inducements to a wise choice, Moses warmed as he proceeded into a tone of solemn and impressive earnestness similar to that of Paul to the elders of Ephesus (Ac 20:26, 27).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I denounce unto, you this day that ye shall surely perish,....

This natural though leads to the motive, which Moses impresses upon the hearts of the people in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>, viz., that He might turn the blessing to them. God had done everything to render the observance of His commandments possible to Israel. "This commandment" (used as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1</a> to denote the whole law) is "not too wonderful for thee," i.e., is not too hard to grasp, or unintelligible (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>), nor is it too far off: it is neither in heaven, i.e., at an inaccessible height; nor beyond the sea, i.e., at an unattainable distance, at the end of the world, so that any one could say, Who is able to fetch it thence? but it is very near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart to do it. It not only lay before the people in writing, but it was also preached to them by word of mouth, and thus brought to their knowledge, so that it had become a subject of conversation as well as of reflection and careful examination. But however near the law had thus been brought to man, sin had so estranged the human heart from the word of God, that doing and keeping the law had become invariably difficult, and in fact impossible; so that the declaration, "the word is in thy heart," only attains its full realization through the preaching of the gospel of the grace of God, and the righteousness that is by faith; and to this the Apostle Paul applies the passage in <a href="/romans/10-8.htm">Romans 10:8</a>. </body></html>
