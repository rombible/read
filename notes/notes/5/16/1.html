But there were special sacrifices of bullocks appointed for the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which followed the Passover. (See <a href="/numbers/28-19.htm" title="But you shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be to you without blemish:">Numbers 28:19</a>.)<p>(6) <span class= "bld">At even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou comest forth from Egypt.</span>—The word “season” here is ambiguous in the English.

The Hebrew word, which usually denotes a <span class= "ital">commemorative </span>time, might seem to point to the hour of sunset as the time when the march actually began. If so, it was the evening of the fifteenth day of the month (See <a href="/numbers/33-3.htm" title="And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.">Numbers 33:3</a>).

It is noticeable that, while the Passover commemorated the deliverance by the slain lamb in Egypt, the Feast of Tabernacles commemorated the encampment at Succoth, the first resting-place of the delivered nation after the exodus had actually begun.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">A solemn assembly.</span>—Literally, as in the Margin, <span class= "ital">a restraint—i.e., </span>a day when work was forbidden.

As a further preservative against idolatry, Moses proceeds to inculcate upon them a strict regard to the most exact observance of the three great annual festivals, appointed by their law to be celebrated at the stated place of national worship, these being designed for this very end, to keep the people steady to the profession and practice of the religion of the one true God. The first of these feasts was the passover, with that of unleavened bread; comprehending the sacrifice of the paschal lamb, with other sacrifices and oblations prescribed for each day of that whole week during which it was to continue. Of which see on <a href="/exodus/12-13.htm" title="And the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.">Exodus 12:13</a>. <span class="ital">Observe the month of Abib — </span>Or of <span class="ital">new fruits, </span>which answers to part of our March and April, and was, by a special order from God, made the beginning of their year, in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt. <span class="ital">By night — </span>In the night Pharaoh was forced to give them leave to depart, and accordingly they made preparation for their departure, and in the morning they perfected the work.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-17 The laws for the three yearly feasts are here repeated; that of the Passover, that of the Pentecost, that of Tabernacles; and the general law concerning the people's attendance. Never should a believer forget his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The cardinal point on which the whole of the prescriptions in this chapter turn, is evidently the same as has been so often insisted on in the previous chapters, namely, the concentration of the religious services of the people round one common sanctuary. The prohibition against observing the great Feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and tabernacle, the three annual epochs in the sacred year of the Jew, at home and in private, is reiterated in a variety of words no less than six times in the first sixteen verses of this chapter <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-6.htm">Deuteronomy 16:6-7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-15.htm">Deuteronomy 16:15-16</a>.

Ass. <span class="ital">pasahu</span>, to placate the deity (Zimmern in Schrader’s <span class="ital">KAT</span>3[137], 610 n.). Since the Passover was celebrated at night others (4) connect its origin with the phases of the moon. Whatever that origin may have been, the feast (as we have seen) was observed by Israel earlier than the Exodus and was possibly the same as the spring sacrifice of firstlings or other tribute from the flocks, common throughout the Semitic world. But its association with the Exodus was undoubtedly early and has ever since constituted its chief, if not its only, significance.

But there is no reason why the original code of D should ignore Maṣṣôth—for which certainly E has a law, <a href="/exodus/23-15.htm" title="You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it you came out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)">Exodus 23:15</a> <span class="ital">a</span>, and (Steuern. notwithstanding) J also, <a href="/exodus/34-18.htm" title="The feast of unleavened bread shall you keep.

(2) More probably we have here a compilation of two laws of D, originally separate, one on Passover and one on Maṣṣôth. In either case the combination of Passover and Maṣṣôth, which was not original and is not accepted even by H in Leviticus 23 (<a href="/leviticus/23-5.htm" title="In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover.">Leviticus 23:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-9.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:9</a> ff.; <a href="/context/leviticus/23-6.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to the LORD: seven days you must eat unleavened bread....">Leviticus 23:6-8</a> are added by P), took place between the date of the original code of D and that of the final composition of the Book of Deuteronomy.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The month of Abib</span> (cf.

This injunction refers primarily to the preparation of the Paschal lamb for a festal meal (<a href="/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a>); but here it is used in a wider sense as referring to the whole Paschal observance, which lasted for seven days. Hence the mention of sheep (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span>) and oxen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) in ver. 2, and the reference to the eating of unleavened bread for seven days "therewith," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. with the Passover. The animal for the Paschal supper was expressly prescribed to be a yearling of the sheep or of the goats (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), and this was to be consumed at one meal; but on the other days of the festival the flesh of other animals offered in sacrifice might be eaten. The term "Passover" here, accordingly, embraces the whole of the festive meals connected with the Passover proper - what the rabbins call <span class="accented">chagigah</span> (Maimon., in 'Kor-ban Pesach,' c. 10. &sect; 12; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/35-7.htm">2 Chronicles 35:7</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If, on the other hand, the servant (or maid) wished to be set free, the master was not to think it hard; "for the double of the wages of a day-labourer he has earned for thee for six years," i.e., not "twice the time of a day-labourer, so that he had really deserved twice the wages" (Vatablius, Ad.
