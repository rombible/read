All personal regards must be laid aside, so that right is done to all, and wrong to none. Care is taken to prevent following the idolatrous customs of the heathen. Nothing belies God more, or tends more to corrupt the minds of men, than representing and worshipping, by an image, that God, who is an almighty and eternal Spirit, present every where. Alas! even in gospel days, and under a better dispensation, established upon better promises, there is a tendency to set up idols, under one form or another, in the human heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses are closely connected in subject with the following chapter, and introduce certain directions for the administration of justice and the carrying on of the civil government of the people in Canaan. During the lifetime of Moses, he himself, especially inspired and guided by God, was sufficient, with the aid of the subordinate judges (compare <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a> ff), for the duties in question. But now that Moses was to be withdrawn, and the people would soon be scattered up and down the land of Canaan, regular and permanent provision must be made for civil and social order and good government.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-20.

After what had already been stated, Moses did not consider it necessary to mention expressly that this festal rejoicing was also to be manifested in joyous sacrificial meals; it was enough for him to point to the blessing which God had bestowed upon their cultivation of the corn, the olive, and the vine, and upon all the works of their hands, i.e., upon their labour generally (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13-15</a>), as there was nothing further to remark after the instructions which had already been given with reference to this feast also (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39-43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>).</body></html>
