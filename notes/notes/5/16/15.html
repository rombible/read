Never should a believer forget his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Feast of Weeks; and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13-17</a>, Feast of Tabernacles.

Seven weeks shall they count "from the beginning of the sickle to the corn," i.e., from the time when the sickle began to be applied to the corn, or from the commencement of the corn-harvest. As the corn-harvest was opened with the presentation of the sheaf of first-fruits on the second day of the Passover, this regulation as to time coincides with the rule laid down in <a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a>. "Thou shalt keep the feast to the Lord thy God according to the measure of the free gift of thy hand, which thou givest as Jehovah thy God blesseth thee." The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514; is the standing rendering in the Chaldee for &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, sufficiency, need; it probably signifies abundance, from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;  equals  &#1502;&#1505;&#1492;, to flow, to overflow, to derive. The idea is this: Israel was to keep this feast with sacrificial gifts, which every one was able to bring, according to the extent to which the Lord had blessed him, and (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>) to rejoice before the Lord at the place where His name dwelt with sacrificial meals, to which the needy were to be invited (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>), in remembrance of the fact that they also were bondmen in Egypt (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>). The "free-will offering of the hand," which the Israelites were to bring with them to this feast, and with which they were to rejoice before the Lord, belonged to the free-will gifts of burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, drink-offerings, and thank-offerings, which might be offered, according to <a href="/numbers/29-39.htm">Numbers 29:39</a> (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-38.htm">Leviticus 23:38</a>), at every feast, along with the festal sacrifices enjoined upon the congregation. The latter were binding upon the priests and congregation, and are fully described in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> and 29, so that there was no necessity for Moses to say anything further with reference to them.</body></html>
