The precise day is supposed to be known from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, as in <a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1495; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; (to prepare the Passover), which is used primarily to denote the preparation of the paschal lamb for a festal meal, is employed here in a wider signification viz., "to keep the Passover." At this feast they were to slay sheep and oxen to the Lord for a Passover, at the place, etc. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>, the word "Passover" is employed in a broader sense, and includes not only the paschal lamb, but the paschal sacrifices generally, which the Rabbins embrace under the common name of chagiga; not the burnt-offerings and sin-offerings, however, prescribed in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19-26</a>, but all the sacrifices that were slain at the feast of the Passover (i.e., during the seven days of the Mazzoth, which are included under the name of pascha) for the purpose of holding sacrificial meals. This is evident from the expression "of the flock and the herd;" as it was expressly laid down, that only a &#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, i.e., a yearling animal of the sheep or goats, was to be slain for the paschal meal on the fourteenth of the month in the evening, and an ox was never slaughtered in the place of the lamb. But if any doubt could exist upon this point, it would be completely set aside by <a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a> : "Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it: seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith." As the word "therewith" cannot possibly refer to anything else than the "Passover" in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>, it is distinctly stated that the slaughtering and eating of the Passover was to last seven days, whereas the Passover lamb was to be slain and consumed in the evening of the fourteenth Abib (<a href="/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a>). Moses called the unleavened bread "the bread of affliction," because the Israelites had to leave Egypt in anxious flight (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>) and were therefore unable to leaven the dough (<a href="/exodus/12-39.htm">Exodus 12:39</a>), for the purpose of reminding the congregation of the oppression endured in Egypt, and to stir them up to gratitude towards the Lord their deliverer, that they might remember that day as long as they lived. (On the meaning of the Mazzothy, see at <a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>.) - On account of the importance of the unleavened bread as a symbolical shadowing forth of the significance of the Passover, as the feast of the renewal and sanctification of the life of Israel, Moses repeats in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-4.htm">Deuteronomy 16:4</a> two of the points in the law of the feast: first of all the one laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-7.htm">Exodus 13:7</a>, that no leaven was to be seen in the land during the seven days; and secondly, the one in <a href="/exodus/23-18.htm">Exodus 23:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-25.htm">Exodus 34:25</a>, that none of the flesh of the paschal lamb was to be left till the next morning, in order that all corruption might be kept at a distance from the paschal food. Leaven, for example, sets the dough in fermentation, from which putrefaction ensues; and in the East, if flesh is kept, it very quickly decomposes. He then once more fixes the time and place for keeping the Passover (the former according to <a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5</a>, etc.), and adds in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-7.htm">Deuteronomy 16:7</a> the express regulation, that not only the slaughtering and sacrificing, but the roasting (see at <a href="/exodus/12-9.htm">Exodus 12:9</a>) and eating of the paschal lamb were to take place at the sanctuary, and that the next morning they could turn and go back home. This rule contains a new feature, which Moses prescribes with reference to the keeping of the Passover in the land of Canaan, and by which he modifies the instructions for the first Passover in Egypt, to suit the altered circumstances. In Egypt, when Israel was not yet raised into the nation of Jehovah, and had as yet no sanctuary and no common altar, the different houses necessarily served as altars. But when this necessity was at an end, the slaying and eating of the Passover in the different houses were to cease, and they were both to take place at the sanctuary before the Lord, as was the case with the feast of Passover at Sinai (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1-5</a>). Thus the smearing of the door-posts with the blood was tacitly abolished, since the blood was to be sprinkled upon the altar as sacrificial blood, as it had already been at Sinai. - The expression "to thy tents," for going "home," points to the time when Israel was till dwelling in tents, and had not as yet secured any fixed abodes and houses in Canaan, although this expression was retained at a still later time (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-9.htm">2 Samuel 19:9</a>, etc.). The going home in the morning after the paschal meal, is not to be understood as signifying a return to their homes in the different towns of the land, but simply, as even Riehm admits, to their homes or lodgings at the place of the sanctuary. How very far Moses was from intending to release the Israelites from the duty of keeping the feast for seven days, is evident from the fact that in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a> he once more enforces the observance of the seven days' feast. The two clauses, "six days thou shalt eat mazzoth," and "on the seventh day shall be azereth (Eng. Ver. 'a solemn assembly') to the Lord thy God," are not placed in antithesis to each other, so as to imply (in contradiction to <a href="/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-4.htm">Deuteronomy 16:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-6.htm">Exodus 13:6-7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17</a>) that the feast of Mazzoth was to last only six days instead of seven; but the seventh day is brought into especial prominence as the azereth of the feast (see at <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>), simply because, in addition to the eating of mazzoth, there was to be an entire abstinence from work, and this particular feature might easily have fallen into neglect at the close of the feast. But just as the eating of mazzoth for seven days is not abolished by the first clause, so the suspension of work on the first day is not abolished by the second clause, any more than in <a href="/exodus/13-6.htm">Exodus 13:6</a> the first day is represented as a working day by the fact that the seventh day is called "a feast to Jehovah."</body></html>
