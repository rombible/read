He knew that he might dwell upon these, for he was addressing many who had been witnesses of those appalling incidents. For it will be remembered that the divine threatening that they should die in the wilderness, and its execution, extended only to males from twenty years and upward, who were able to go forth to war. No males under twenty years of age, no females, and none of the tribe of Levi, were objects of the denunciation (see Nu 14:28-30; 16:49). There might, therefore, have been many thousands of the Israelites at that time of whom Moses could say, "Your eyes have seen all the great acts which He did"; and with regard to those the historic review of Moses was well calculated to stir up their minds to the duty and advantages of obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> All of them had seen some, and some of them had seen all the great things done in Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did; Even all before related, with many others; and therefore the instruction they should learn from thence should be as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">But your eyes</span> <span class="bld">are those that have seen</span>] Cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-21.htm" title="He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.">Deuteronomy 10:21</a> Sg.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the great work</span>] LXX <span class="ital">works</span>; cp. the deuteronomic passage, <a href="/judges/2-7.htm" title="And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.">Jdg 2:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - Thus from what they themselves had witnessed does Moses admonish the elder members of the congregation, summoning them to recognize in that the purpose of God to discipline and train them, that so they might keep his commandments and be strengthened in soul and purpose to go in and possess the land, and to live long therein (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - For <span class="accented">but</span>, read <span class="accented">yea</span>: Yea, your eyes have seen, etc. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-1.htm">Deuteronomy 11:1-12</a> the other feature in the divine requirements (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>), viz., love to the Lord their God, is still more fully developed.
