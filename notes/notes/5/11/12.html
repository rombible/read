Sin tends to shorten the days of all men, and to shorten the days of a people's prosperity. God will bless them with an abundance of all good things, if they would love him and serve him. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is; but the favour of God shall put gladness into the heart, more than the increase of corn, and wine, and oil. Revolt from God to idols would certainly be their ruin. Take heed that your hearts be not deceived. All who forsake God to set their affection upon any creature, will find themselves wretchedly deceived, to their own destruction; and this will make it worse, that it was for want of taking heed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another motive for fidelity is added, namely, the entire dependence of the promised land upon God for its fertility. It was "a land flowing with milk and honey;" yet this its richness was not, as was that of Egypt, the reward of truman skill and labor, but was, on the contrary, the gift of God simply and entirely; the effect of "the former and the latter rains" sent by Him. The spiritual significance of these and many other such peculiarities of the promised land must not be overlooked.<p>Egypt and Canaan are distinguished in this and the following verses, by certain of their most remarkable physical traits. Canaan as a mountainous country (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/3-25.htm">Deuteronomy 3:25</a> note) was well watered, but by the rains of heaven, on which it absolutely depended for its crops. Artificial irrigation could do nothing to remedy this dependence. Hence, it was a land on which, so long as God's people were faithful and consequently prosperous, "the eyes of God" would always be: i. e., He would supply at each successive season (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14-15</a>) the useful conditions of productiveness. But Egypt, fit emblem here as elsewhere of the world of nature in distinction from the world of grace, though of course deriving its all ultimately from the Giver of all good things, yet directly and immediately owed its riches and plenty to human ingenuity and capital. It enjoyed no rain worth speaking of, but drew its water supply from the annum overflowing of the Nile. This only lasts about a hundred days; but is rendered available for agricultural purposes throughout the year by an elaborate and costly system of tanks, canals, forcing machines, etc. To these mechanical appliances allusion is made in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10</a>. The inhabitants of Egypt probably watered "with the foot" in two ways, namely, by means of tread-wheels working sets of pumps, and by means of artificial channels connected with reservoirs, and opened, turned, or closed by the feet. Both methods are still in use in Egypt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

And therefore it is not at all strange that some later writers decry the land of Canaan as in great part a barren soil, which is so far from affording any ground to question the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, in which its fruitfulness is declared, that it doth much more confirm it, this being but an effect of that threatening that God would <span class="ital">turn a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of those that dwell in it</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/107-34.htm" title="A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.">Psalm 107:34</a></span>, and elsewhere; and the wickedness of the Israelites in succeeding ages being notorious, it is but just and fit that the barrenness of their land should be as evident and infamous. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>A land which the Lord thy God careth for,....

It was a land on which Jehovah's regard was continually fixed, over which he watched with unceasing care, and which was sustained by his bounty; a land, therefore, wholly dependent on him, and so a fitting place for a people also wholly dependent on him, who owed to his grace all that they were and had. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To awaken this love they were now to know, i.e., to ponder and lay to heart, the discipline of the Lord their God. The words from "for (I speak) not" to "have not seen" are a parenthetical clause, by which Moses would impress his words most strongly upon the hearts of the older generation, which had witnessed the acts of the Lord. The clause is without any verb or predicate, but this can easily be supplied from the sense. The best suggestion is that of Schultz, viz., &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, "for it is not with your children that I have to do," not to them that this admonition applies. Moses refers to the children who had been born in the desert, as distinguished from those who, though not twenty years old when the Israelites came out of Egypt, had nevertheless seen with their own eyes the plagues inflicted upon Egypt, and who were now of mature age, viz., between forty and sixty years old, and formed, as the older and more experienced generation, the stock and kernel of the congregation assembled round him now. To the words, "which have not known and have not seen," it is easy to supply from the context, "what ye have known and seen." The accusatives from "the chastisement" onwards belong to the verb of the principal sentence, "know ye this day." The accusatives which follow show what we are to understand by "the chastisement of the Lord," viz., the mighty acts of the Lord to Egypt and to Israel in the desert. The object of them all was to educate Israel in the fear and love of God. In this sense Moses calls them &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; (Eng. Ver. chastisement), &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, i.e., not punishment only, but education by the manifestation of love as well as punishment (like &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-36.htm">Deuteronomy 4:36</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>, <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>, etc.). "His greatness," etc., as in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>. On the signs and acts in Egypt, see at <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>; and on those at the Red Sea, at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; - &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "over whose face He made the waters of the Red Sea to flow;" cf. <a href="/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26</a>. - By the acts of God in the desert (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-5.htm">Deuteronomy 11:5</a>) we are not to understand the chastenings in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11-15</a> either solely or pre-eminently, but all the manifestations of the omnipotence of God in the guidance of Israel, proofs of love as well as the penal wonders. Of the latter, the miraculous destruction of the company of Korah is specially mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a> (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). Here Moses only mentions Dathan and Abiram, the followers of Korah, and not Korah himself, probably from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah. "Everything existing, which was in their following" (see <a href="/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>), does not mean their possessions, but their servants, and corresponds to "all the men who belonged to Korah" in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>, whereas the possessions mentioned there are included here in the "tents." &#1492;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is only applied to living beings, as in <a href="/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a> and <a href="/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>. - In <a href="/deuteronomy/11-7.htm">Deuteronomy 11:7</a> the reason is given for the admonition in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2</a> : the elders were to know (discern) the educational purpose of God in those mighty acts of the Lord, because they had seen them with their own eyes. </body></html>
