There is an addition, requiring the masters to put some small stock into their servants' hands to set up with for themselves, when sent out of their servitude, wherein they had received no wages. We may expect family blessings, the springs of family prosperity, when we make conscience of our duty to our family relations. We are to remember that we are debtors to Divine justice, and have nothing to pay with. That we are slaves, poor, and perishing. But the Lord Jesus Christ, by becoming poor, and by shedding his blood, has made a full and free provision for the payment of our debts, the ransom of our souls, and the supply of all our wants. When the gospel is clearly preached, the acceptable year of the Lord is proclaimed; the year of release of our debts, of the deliverance of our souls, and of obtaining rest in him. And as faith in Christ and love to him prevail, they will triumph over the selfishness of the heart, and over the unkindness of the world, doing away the excuses that rise from unbelief, distrust, and covetousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The commands here are repeated from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>, with amplifications relative to the maidservant <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a> and to the making (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-13.htm">Deuteronomy 15:13</a> ff) liberal provision for launching the freedman on an independent course of life. The release of the servant is connected with the sabbatical principle though not with the sabbatical year. It is noteworthy also that the prospect of a gift of this sort, the amount of which was left to the master's discretion, would be likely to encourage diligence and faithfulness during the years of servitude.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee&#8212;If they declined to avail themselves of the privilege of release and chose to remain with their master, then by a peculiar form of ceremony they became a party to the transaction, voluntarily sold themselves to their employer, and continued in his service till death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Because he is sensible that he fares well with thee.

This is an emblem of the cheerful and constant obedience of the people of Christ to him their master, flowing from love to him; whom they love above all persons and things, with all their heart and soul, and his house also, the place of his worship, his ordinances, truths, ministers and children; and therefore choose to be where they are, finding that they are there well used, fare well, having bread enough and to spare, spiritual provisions in plenty; are well clothed with the righteousness of Christ, have the good company of the saints and excellent in the earth, in whom is all their delight; and, above all, the presence of their Lord and master, and the smiles of his countenance. <p>(k) Maimon. in Misn.

This was not a painful operation, especially as the servant's ear was probably already pierced for a ring; nor does any infamy appear to have been attached to the bearing of this badge of perpetual servitude. There is no mention here, as in Exodus, of the matter being referred to the judges; and this has led some to suppose that, by the time this later prescription was given, the earlier usage had passed away; but it is more natural to suppose that this usage was so regular and well known that it was needless formally to announce it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thou shalt give him, and thy heart shall not become evil, i.e., discontented thereat (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>), for Jehovah will bless thee for it (cf. <a href="/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-27.htm">Proverbs 28:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-2.htm">Psalm 41:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>). </body></html>
