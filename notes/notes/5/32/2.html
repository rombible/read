Everything that comes down from the “Father of lights” is handed on by one heavenly messenger to another, until it falls upon the heart of man, in just that form in which he can best receive it. The Son of God says,” My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me.” “I speak that which I have seen with my Father.” Of the Holy Spirit He says, “He shall <span class= "ital">receive of Mine </span>and shall show it unto you.” The apostles speak “in words which the Holy Ghost teacheth.” The parallels of the verse appear to be these:—My learning shall drop as the <span class= "ital">rain; </span>My speech shall distil as the <span class= "ital">dew, </span>as the <span class= "ital">sweeping showers </span>upon the tender herb, as the <span class= "ital">multitude of drops </span>upon the grass. The “small rain” of the Authorised Version points to a different and probably untenable derivation of the Hebrew word.

Which some, as Aben Ezra, take to be a prayer or wish, that the doctrine spoken by him might fall upon men like rain and dew on the earth, penetrate into their hearts, and influence them, and produce good effects there; but the words rather seem to be a prophecy of what would be: and by his "doctrine" and "speech", which signify the same thing, is meant, not his law, which was fiery, this cooling, like rain and dew; that was like a storm, this as a gentle rain; that was terrible, this desirable; that was distressing, this refreshing, this no other than the Gospel, the speech of God, the doctrine of Christ, the doctrine of grace, and mercy through him, and of life and salvation by him: it has its name from a word, which signifies to "receive" (f); for it was received from God by Moses, and by the prophets after him, by Christ himself, as Mediator, and by the apostles from him, and is worthy of the acceptation of all: this is comparable to "rain", because, like that, it comes from heaven, is the gift of God, tarries not for man, but comes without any desert of man, and often without his desire; falls by divine direction in places and on persons, as the Lord's will and pleasure is, and that in great plenty, with a fulness of spiritual blessings, and precious promises; and for its effects, it cools the conscience, filled with fiery wrath and indignation, moistens and softens the hard heart, like the dry and parched earth, refreshes and revives the drooping spirit, and makes barren souls fruitful in grace and good works: and it is like "dew", which also is from heaven, and of God, fell in the night of the world; and as that falls in a temperate air, so this, when the stormy dispensation of the law was over; and though but a small thing in the eyes of the world, is of great influence, the power of God unto salvation, very grateful and delightful, and of great moment and importance; hereby the love and favour of God is diffused, the blessings of grace dispensed, the heavenly manna communicated, and the Spirit and his graces received: and this, like rain and dew, "drops" and "distils" silently, not in a noisy manner as the law; insensibly, falling on persons at an unawares, in great abundance, like the drops of rain and dew; and effectually, working in all that believe: dew was a symbol of doctrine with the Egyptians (g): this is further illustrated: <p>as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass: the first of those words for "rain", according to Jarchi, has the signification of a stormy wind, but that seems to contradict the gentle dropping and distilling of it; rather it signifies "hairs" (h), and denotes, as our version, the smallness of the rain, being as small, thin, and light as hairs; and the latter word (i) has the signification of millions and thousands, there being such vast, numbers as those in a shower of rain: the "tender herb" and "grass" may denote the multitude of persons to whom the Gospel would come, and be made useful; and may describe sensible sinners, tender consciences, such as are weak in themselves, with whom it is the day of small things, are newborn babes, little children; who are just springing up in grace, as among the grass, and as willows by the water courses: now all this is said by Moses, to recommend his doctrine, as well as what follows. <p>(f) a "accepit".

Having returned from the tabernacle, he finished the writing out of the laws, and then gave the book of the law to the Levites, with a command to put it by the side of the ark of the covenant, that it might be there for a witness against the people, as He knew its rebellion and stiffneckedness (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-27</a>). &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;, to write upon a book, equivalent to write down, commit to writing. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491;, till their being finished, i.e., complete. By the "Levites who bare the ark of the covenant" we are not to understand ordinary Levites, but the Levitical priests, who were entrusted with the ark. "The Levites" is simply a contraction for the full expression, "the priests the sons of Levi" (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>). It is true that, according to <a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>., the Kohathites were appointed to carry the holy vessels, which included the ark of the covenant, on the journey through the desert; but it was the priests, and not they, who were the true bearers and guardians of the holy things, as we may see from the fact that the priests had first of all to wrap up these holy things in a careful manner, before they handed them over to the Kohathites, that they might not touch the holy things and die (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Hence we find that on solemn occasions, when the ark was to be brought out in all its full significance and glory, - as, for example, in the crossing of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9-10</a>), when encompassing Jericho (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6</a>, <a href="/joshua/6-12.htm">Joshua 6:12</a>), at the setting up of the law on Ebal and Gerizim (<a href="/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>), and at the consecration of Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>), - it was not by the Levites, but by the priests, that the ark of the covenant was borne. In fact the Levites were, strictly speaking, only their (the priests') servants, who relieved them of this and the other labour, so that what they did was done in a certain sense through them. If the (non-priestly) Levites were not to touch the ark of the covenant, and not even to put in the poles (<a href="/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6</a>), Moses would not have handed over the law-book, to be kept by the ark of the covenant to them, but to the priests. &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1491;, at the side of the ark, or, according to the paraphrase of Jonathan, "in a case on the right side of the ark of the covenant," which may be correct, although we must not think of this case, as many of the early theologians do, as a secondary ark attached to the ark of the covenant (see Lundius, Jd. Heiligth. pp. 73, 74). The tables of the law were deposited in the ark (<a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>), and the book of the law was to be kept by its side. As it formed, from its very nature, simply an elaborate commentary upon the decalogue, it was also to have its place outwardly as an accompaniment to the tables of the law, for a witness against the people, in the same manner as the song in the mouth of the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-21.htm">Deuteronomy 31:21</a>). For, as Moses adds in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-27.htm">Deuteronomy 31:27</a>, in explanation of his instructions, "I know thy rebelliousness, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>); and how much more after my death."<p>With these words Moses handed over the complete book of the law to the Levitical priests. For although the handing over is not expressly mentioned, it is unquestionably implied in the words, "Take this book, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant," as the finishing of the writing of the laws is mentioned immediately before. But if Moses finished the writing of the law after he had received instructions from the Lord to compose the ode, what he wrote will reach to <a href="/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>; and what follows from <a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24</a> onwards will form the appendix to his work by a different hand.<p>(Note: The objection brought against this view by Riehm, namely, that "it founders on the fact that the style and language in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-30</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-44.htm">Deuteronomy 32:44-47</a> are just the same as in the earlier portion of the book," simply shows that he has not taken into consideration that, with the simple style adopted in Hebrew narrative, we could hardly expect in eleven verses, which contain for the most part simply words and sayings of Moses, to find any very striking difference of language or of style. This objection, therefore, merely proves that no valid arguments can be adduced against the view in question.)<p>The supposition that Moses himself inserted his instructions concerning the preservation of the book of the law, and the ode which follows, is certainly possible, but not probable. The decision as to the place where it should be kept was not of such importance as to need insertion in the book of the law, since sufficient provision for its safe keeping had been made by the directions in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>.; and although God had commanded him to write the ode, it was not for the purpose of inserting it on the Thorah as an essential portion of it, but to let the people learn it, to put it in the mouth of the people. The allusion to this ode in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-19.htm">Deuteronomy 31:19</a>. furnishes no conclusive evidence, either that Moses himself included it in the law-book which he had written with the account of his oration in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-28.htm">Deuteronomy 31:28-30</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1-43</a>, or that the appendix which Moses did not write commences at <a href="/deuteronomy/31-14.htm">Deuteronomy 31:14</a> of this chapter. For all that follows with certainty from the expression "this song" (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-19.htm">Deuteronomy 31:19</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/31-22.htm">Deuteronomy 31:22</a>), which certainly points to the song in ch. 32, is that Moses himself handed over the ode to the priests with the complete book of the law, as a supplement to the law, and that this ode was then inserted by the writer of the appendix in the appendix itself. </body></html>
