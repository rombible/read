The predicate Elohim (vid., <a href="/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>) is omitted, because it is contained in the thought itself, and moreover is clearly expressed in the parallel clause which follows, "there is not a God beside Me." Jehovah manifests himself in His doings, which Israel had experienced already, and still continued to experience. He kills and makes alive, etc., i.e., He has the power of life and death. These words do not refer to the immortality of the soul, but to the restoration of life of the people of Israel, which God had delivered up to death (so <a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm">1 Samuel 2:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-7.htm">2 Kings 5:7</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>; Wisd. 16:13; Tobit 13:2). This thought, and the following one, which is equally consolatory, that God smites and heals again, are frequently repeated by the prophets (vid., <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17-18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-14.htm">Jeremiah 17:14</a>).
