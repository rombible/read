This, by Le Clerc, and many others, is referred to the vengeance which God would inflict on the enemies of the Jews. But surely the verses with which it is immediately connected, whether preceding or following, render it much more probable that the vengeance which should come on the Jews themselves, is intended, as if he had said, My long- suffering toward them may make them think I have forgotten their sins: but I remember them punctually.

Or, the allusion may be to deeds signed and sealed, and kept safely in a cabinet, though not presently executed, and in that case the meaning will be that the execution of the vengeance was a thing notified and determined in the mind of God, but that the time was reserved with him as a profound secret, known only to himself.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:26-38 The idolatry and rebellions of Israel deserved, and the justice of God seemed to demand, that they should be rooted out. But He spared Israel, and continues them still to be living witnesses of the truth of the Bible, and to silence unbelievers. They are preserved for wise and holy purposes and the prophecies give us some idea what those purposes are. The Lord will never disgrace the throne of his glory. It is great wisdom, and will help much to the return of sinners to God, seriously to consider their latter end, or the future state. It is here meant particularly of what God foretold by Moses, about this people in the latter days; but it may be applied generally. Oh that men would consider the happiness they will lose, and the misery they will certainly plunge into, if they go on in their trespasses! What will be in the end thereof? Jer 5:31. For the Lord will in due time bring down the enemies of the church, in displeasure against their wickedness. When sinners deem themselves most secure, they suddenly fall into destruction. And God's time to appear for the deliverance of his people, is when things are at the worst with them. But those who trust to any rock but God, will find it fail them when they most need it. The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish nation, is the continuance of their ancient idolatry, apostacy, and rebellion. They shall be brought to humble themselves before the Lord, to repent of their sins, and to trust in their long-rejected Mediator for salvation. Then he will deliver them, and make their prosperity great.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their vine - i. e., the nature and character of Israel: compare for similar expressions <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>.<p>Sodom ...

The "this" in ver. 34 is by some understood of the sinful doings of the Israelites which God should not forget or overlook. So the Targum of Onkelos: "Are not all their works manifest before me, kept against the day of judgment in my treasures?" So also Calvin, "<span class="accented">Quanquam</span> de poenis hunc versum quidam exponunt, acsi Deus assereret diversas earum species apud se paratas esse, quas depromat quoties libuerit: rectius tamen est de sceleribus intelligere." But there is a more 'comprehensive reference here. Not only the deeds of the transgressors, but the judgments that should come on Israel, and also God's interposition on their behalf, <span class="accented">were laid up in store with him</span>, <span class="accented">and sealed up among his treasures</span>. All that had been done had been noted, and all that should happen was decreed, and should certainly come to pass. The "this' has thus both a retrospective and a prospective reference; it includes both the sin of the nation and God's dealing with them afterwards, as well as his judgments on their enemies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My treasures</span>. God's treasures contain not only a store of blessing, but also instruments of punishment, which as he sees meet, he sends forth on men (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>; <a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22, 23</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I should say, I will blow them away, I will blot out the remembrance of them among men; if I did not fear wrath upon the enemy, that their enemies might mistake it, that they might say, Our hand was high, and Jehovah has not done all this." The meaning is, that the people would have deserved to be utterly destroyed, and it was only for His own name's sake that God abstained from utter destruction. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; to be construed conditionally requires &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;: if I did not fear (as actually was the case) I should resolve to destroy them, without leaving a trace behind. "I should say," used to denote the purpose of God, like "he said" in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1488;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501;, which has been rendered in very different ways, cannot be regarded, as it is by the Rabbins, as a denom. verb from &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, a corner; and Calvin's rendering, "to scatter through corners," does not suit the context; whilst the meaning, "to cast or scare out of all corners," cannot be deduced from this derivation. The context requires the signification to annihilate, as the remembrance of them was to vanish from the earth. We get this meaning if we trace it to &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, to blow, - related to &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; (<a href="/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>) and &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;, from which comes &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, - in the Hiphil "to blow away," not to blow asunder. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, not "to cause to rest," but to cause to cease, delere (as in <a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4</a>). "Wrath upon the enemy," i.e., "displeasure on the part of God at the arrogant boasting of the enemy, which was opposed to the glory of God" (Vitringa). &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, lest, after &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to fear. On this reason for sparing Israel, see <a href="/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>.; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>. Enemy is a generic term, hence it is followed by the plural. &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, Piel, to find strange, sc., the destruction of Israel, i.e., to mistake the reason for it, or, as is shown by what follows, to ascribe the destruction of Israel to themselves and their own power, whereas it had been the word of God. "Our hand was high," i.e., has lifted itself up or shown itself mighty, an intentional play upon the "high hand" of the Lord (<a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). - The reason why Israel did not deserve to be spared is given in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-28.htm">Deuteronomy 32:28</a> : "For a people forsaken of counsel are they, and there is not understanding in them." "Forsaken of counsel," i.e., utterly destitute of counsel.<p>This want of understanding on the part of Israel is still further expounded in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29-32</a>, where the words of God pass imperceptibly into the words of Moses, who feels impelled once more to impress the word which the Lord had spoken upon the hearts of the people.</body></html>
