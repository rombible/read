I believe a clue to the reason may be found in the words and act which constituted their transgression. They were bidden to speak to the rock in Kadesh, and they struck it. The words which Moses used on that occasion were, “Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water <span class= "ital">out of this cliff </span>(<span class= "ital">Selagh</span>)<span class= "ital">?</span>” The last words of the sentence are emphatic; and the rock is described as a <span class= "ital">cliff, </span>not by the name given to the Rock in Horeb (<span class= "ital">Tzûr</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The emphasis laid upon these words has been much discussed by Jewish commentators, though it escapes English readers. I suspect that the mistake Moses and Aaron made, in thinking it needful to <span class= "ital">strike </span>the cliff, also led them to think it necessary to <span class= "ital">ascend it, </span>instead of gathering the congregation together beneath it, and speaking to it from below. This view harmonises with the spiritual significance of the act. The smitten Rock in Horeb was Christ; the Cliff not to be smitten in Kadesh pointed also to Christ, ascended now, needing only the prayer of faith to call down all that He will give. And so Moses himself taught, in some of his latest words. “It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say, <span class= "ital">Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us? </span>. . . <span class= "ital">But the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth.”</span><p>The impatient words of Moses, after toiling up the cliff with his brother Aaron, had to be recompensed by their ascending mount Hor and mount Nebo to die. Moses, as the more responsible of the two, had to ascend on each occasion, for his brother’s death and for his own. The remembrance of his brother’s death in the Lord may well have comforted Moses in the prospect of his own.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/32-50.htm" title="And die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:">Deuteronomy 32:50</a></span>. <span class="ital">And died in the mount — </span>Not immediately, but after he had blessed the people, as in the next chapter. <span class="ital">Be gathered unto thy people — </span>We seem to be compelled to understand this of the soul of Moses, to be associated in paradise with the souls of the just, here termed his people; in which sense it is taken by some of the Jewish writers.

God reminds him of the sin of which he had been guilty, for which he was kept from entering Canaan. It is good for the best of men to die repenting the infirmities of which they are conscious. But those may die with comfort and ease, whenever God calls for them, notwithstanding the sins they remember against themselves, who have a believing prospect, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life beyond death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses were, no doubt, added by the author of the supplement to Deuteronomy.
