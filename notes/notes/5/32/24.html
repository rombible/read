Jarchi observes, that one of their writers (c) interprets the words "hairs of hunger", because he says that a man that is famishing and pining, his hair grows, and he becomes hairy: this judgment was notorious among the Jews, at the siege of Jerusalem, and was very sore and dreadful: See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, <p>and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction; with burning fevers, pestilential ones, with the plague, the arrow of the Lord that flies by day, the pestilence that walks in darkness, and the destruction that wastes at noonday, <a href="/psalms/91-5.htm">Psalm 91:5</a>; and which also raged at the siege of Jerusalem, arising from the stench of dead bodies, which lay in all parts of the city, and is one of the signs of the destruction of it given by our Lord, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>, <p>I will also send the teeth, of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust; another of the arrows in the quiver of the Lord of hosts, or of his four judgments, and which he used to threaten the people of the Jews with in case of disobedience, <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>. And such of the Jews who fled to deserts, and caves and dens of the earth, for shelter, could not escape falling into the hands of wild beasts, and of meeting with poisonous serpents that go upon their bellies, and feed on the dust of the earth; and besides, when Titus had taken Jerusalem, he disposed of his captives some one way and some another; and, among the rest, many were cast to the wild beasts in the theatre, as Josephus relates (d); add to this, that both Rome Pagan, and Roman Papal, are called beasts, <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; into both whose hands the Jews fell, and from whom they have suffered much; with which in part agrees the Targum of Jerusalem, <p>"the teeth of the four monarchies, which are like to wild beasts, I will send upon them;''and particularly the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases it,"and the Greeks, who bite with their teeth like wild beasts, I will send upon them;''but it would have been much better to have interpreted it of the Romans. <p>(b)   , de Bello Jud. l. 5. c. 23. sect. 4.

Forsaking the rock of its salvation, Israel gave itself up to the service of worthless idols. The expression "excite to jealousy" is founded upon the figure of a marriage covenant, under which the relation of the Lord to Israel is represented (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>, and the com. on <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>).

It is also used in <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>. - "Not-God," a composite noun, in apposition to Shedim (devils), like the other expressions which follow: "gods whom they knew not," i.e., who had not made themselves known to them as gods by any benefit or blessing (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>); "new (ones), who had come from near," i.e., had but lately risen up and been adopted by the Israelites. "Near," not in a local but in a temporal sense, in contrast to Jehovah, who had manifested and attested Himself as God from of old (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;, to shudder, construed here with an accusative, to experience a holy shuddering before a person, to revere with holy awe. - In <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a> Moses returns to the thought of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, for the purpose of expressing it emphatically once more, and paving the way for a transition to the description of the acts of the Lord towards His rebellious nation. To bring out still more prominently the base ingratitude of the people, he represents the creation of Israel by Jehovah, the rock of its salvation, under the figure of generation and birth, in which the paternal and maternal love of the Lord to His people had manifested itself. &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, to twist round, then applied to the pains of childbirth.
