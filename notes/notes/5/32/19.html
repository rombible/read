The phrase, "to cause to drive over the high places of the earth," is a figurative expression for the victorious subjugation of a land; it is not taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>, as Ewald assumes, but is original both here and in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>. "Drive" (ride) is only a more majestic expression for "advance." The reference to this passage in <a href="/isaiah/58-14.htm">Isaiah 58:14</a> is unmistakeable. Whoever has obtained possession of the high places of a country is lord of the land. The "high places of the earth" do not mean the high places of Canaan only, although the expression in this instance relates to the possession of Canaan. "And he (Jacob) ate:" for, so that he could now eat, the productions of the field, and in fact all the riches of the fruitful land, which are then described in superabundant terms. Honey out of the rock and oil out of the flint-stone, i.e., the most valuable productions out of the most unproductive places, since God so blessed the land that even the rocks and stones were productive. The figure is derived from the fact that Canaan abounds in wild bees, which make their hives in clefts of the rock, and in olive-trees which grow in a rocky soil. "Rock-flints," i.e., rocky flints. The nouns in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a> are dependent upon "to suck" in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>, as the expression is not used literally. "Things which are sweet and pleasant to eat, people are in the habit of sucking" (Ges. thes. p. 601). &#1495;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492; and &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; (though &#1492;&#1500;&#1489; seems to require a form &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;; vid., Ewald, 213, b.) denotes the two forms in which the milk yielded by the cattle was used; the latter, milk in general, and the former thick curdled milk, cream, and possibly also butter. The two are divided poetically here, and the cream being assigned to the cattle, and the milk to the sheep and goats. "The fat of lambs," i.e., "lambs of the best description laden with fat" (Vitringa). Fat is a figurative expression for the best (vid., <a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>). "And rams:" grammatically, no doubt, this might also be connected with "the fat," but it is improbable from a poetical point of view, since the enumeration would thereby drag prosaically; and it is also hardly reconcilable with the apposition &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, i.e., reared in Bashan (vid., <a href="/ezekiel/39-18.htm">Ezekiel 39:18</a>), which implies that Bashan was celebrated for its rams, and not merely for its oxen. This epithet, which Kamphausen renders "of Bashan's kind," is unquestionably used for the best description of rams. The list becomes poetical, if we take "rams" as an accusative governed by the verb "to suck" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>). "Kidney-fat (i.e., the best fat) of wheat," the finest and most nutritious wheat. Wine is mentioned last, and in this case the list passes with poetic freedom into the form of an address. "Grape-blood" for red wine (as in <a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>). &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, from &#1495;&#1502;&#1512; to ferment, froth, foam, lit., the foaming, i.e., fiery wine, serves as a more precise definition of the "blood of the grape."</body></html>
