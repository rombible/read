And, according to Josephus, Titus himself, though a heathen, saw and acknowledged the hand of God in the affair. For, observing the vast height of the walls, the largeness of every stone, and the exact order wherein they were laid and compacted, he cried out, “God was with us in this war: it is he that drove the Jews from these munitions. For what could the hands of men or machines have availed against such towers?” Perhaps it may not be improper to mention here, as a further illustration of this prophecy, and its accomplishment, what is related, not only by the Christian writers of that age, Chrysostom, Sozomen, and Socrates, but also by Ammianus Marcellinus, a heathen historian, that when Julian the Apostate ordered the temple of Jerusalem to be rebuilt, with a view to give the lie to our Saviour’s prophecy concerning it, “terrible globes of fire burst out near the foundations, which overturned all, burned the workmen, and made the place so inaccessible, that they desisted from the attempt.” See Bishop Warburton’s book, entitled <span class="ital">Julian.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:19-25 The revolt of Israel was described in the foregoing verses, and here follow the resolves of Divine justice as to them.

The terms, "not a people," and "a foolish nation," mean such a people as, not being God's, would not be accounted a people at all (compare <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>), and such a nation as is destitute of that which alone can make a really "wise and understanding people" <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>, namely, the knowledge of the revealed word and will of God (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-28</a>).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. those which are not a people&#8212;that is, not favored with such great and peculiar privileges as the Israelites (or, rather poor, despised heathens).

Here begins the account of temporal and corporeal judgments inflicted on the Jews for their disbelief and rejection of the Messiah, their contempt of his Gospel, and ill treatment of his followers; and this here respects the destruction of the land of Judea in general, and the burning of the city and temple of Jerusalem in particular, as the effect of the wrath and anger of God like fire kindled against them: <p>and shall burn unto the lowest hell; which denotes an entire destruction, like that of the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone from heaven; which issued in a sulphurous lake, and which sulphureous matter sunk to the bottom of the Dead Sea; and to that destruction is this of the land of Judea compared, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, <p>and shall consume the earth with her increase: the land of Judea, with the cities and towns in it, and buildings on it, and the fruits of the earth; which were either gathered into their barns and storehouses, or were growing in their fields, and vineyards, and oliveyards; all were destroyed and consumed at or before the destruction of Jerusalem, or quickly after it: <p>and set on fire the foundations of the mountains; the city of Jerusalem, as Jarchi himself interprets it, whose foundations were by the mountains, according to <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>; and the temple of Jerusalem particularly was built on Mount Moriah, and that as well as the city was utterly consumed by fire: and it is remarkable that when Julian the apostate attempted to rebuild it, as is related even by an Heathen historian (a), that flames of fire burst out from the foundations, and burnt the workmen; so that he was obliged to desist from his rash undertaking. <p>(a) Ammian.

The Divine wrath kindles a consuming fire, that burns down to the lowest depths - to the deepest part of <span class="accented">sheol -</span> consumes the earth's produce, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. This does not refer to any particular judgment that was to befall the national Israel, but is a general description of the effects of the Divine wrath when that is poured forth in judgments on men. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"They excited His jealousy through strange (gods), they provoked Him by abominations. They sacrificed to devils, which (were) not-God; to gods whom they knew not, to new (ones) that had lately come up, whom your fathers feared not. The rock which begat thee thou forsookest, and hast forgotten the God that bare thee." These three verses are only a further expansion of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>. Forsaking the rock of its salvation, Israel gave itself up to the service of worthless idols. The expression "excite to jealousy" is founded upon the figure of a marriage covenant, under which the relation of the Lord to Israel is represented (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>, and the com. on <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>).

It is also used in <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>. - "Not-God," a composite noun, in apposition to Shedim (devils), like the other expressions which follow: "gods whom they knew not," i.e., who had not made themselves known to them as gods by any benefit or blessing (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>); "new (ones), who had come from near," i.e., had but lately risen up and been adopted by the Israelites. "Near," not in a local but in a temporal sense, in contrast to Jehovah, who had manifested and attested Himself as God from of old (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;, to shudder, construed here with an accusative, to experience a holy shuddering before a person, to revere with holy awe. - In <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a> Moses returns to the thought of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, for the purpose of expressing it emphatically once more, and paving the way for a transition to the description of the acts of the Lord towards His rebellious nation. To bring out still more prominently the base ingratitude of the people, he represents the creation of Israel by Jehovah, the rock of its salvation, under the figure of generation and birth, in which the paternal and maternal love of the Lord to His people had manifested itself. &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, to twist round, then applied to the pains of childbirth.
