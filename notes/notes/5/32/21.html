With a false messiah; for after the death of Jesus, the true Messiah, God as well as man, many false Christs arose, as he predicted, and were received for a time, who were mere men, and deceivers; and their now vainly expected messiah, or whom they look for, according to their own sense of him, is no other than a mere creature, and not God: or with the idol of their own righteousness; which, as an idol is nothing in the world, that is, nothing in the business of justification, and put in the room of Christ highly provokes the Lord to jealousy: <p>they have provoked me to anger with their vanities; such were their false Christs they in vain trusted in, and such the idol of their own righteousness they set up, but could not make to stand; and such were the traditions of their elders; they put upon an equality with, or above the word of God; all which stirred up the wrath and anger of God against them: <p>and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people: this is not to be understood of any particular nation, but of the Gentiles in general, and of God's elect among them, and of the calling of them; which would be provoking to the Jews, as the Apostle Paul has taught us to understand it, <a href="/romans/10-19.htm">Romans 10:19</a>. These were not the people of God, or not my people, as he says <a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a>; In some sense indeed they were his people, being chosen by him, and taken into covenant with him; for he is God not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles also; and those were given to Christ as his people, and are his other sheep which were not of the Jewish fold; and who were redeemed by him to be a peculiar people out of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation, all which was before their calling: yet, in another sense they were not his people; they were without any spiritual privileges, the word and ordinances, without the knowledge of God and Christ, without communion with them; they were not a people near unto the Lord, he had not laid hold on and formed them for himself in regeneration and conversion; they were not reckoned the people of God, nor called so, and especially by the Jews, who accounted themselves to be the only people of God; see <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>, <p>I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation; either the Romans in particular are meant, so called because of their gross idolatry, to which they were addicted, who otherwise in their political affairs were a wise and understanding people; to these Judea became a province, and were subject to tribute; and by the exactions of the Romans, and their ill usage of them, they were provoked to rise against them, which issued in their ruin: or rather the Gentiles in general, who might be called foolish because of their superstition and idolatry, ignorance, and blindness in religious matters, and especially were so in the account of the Jews; and the elect of God among them in particular, who in their state of unregeneracy were foolish, as all unregenerate men are; both their principles and practices were foolish, and they were the foolish things of the Gentile world that God chose and called: and the calling of them was exceedingly provoking to the Jews; which was as if a man, moved to jealousy by the behaviour of his wife, should strip her of her ornaments and jewels, and reject her as his wife; and take another before her eyes of mean estate, and marry her, and put her ornaments on her, to which the allusion is; for the Lord, being moved to jealousy by the conduct of the Jewish nation towards him, rejected them from being his people, and stripped them of all their privileges, civil and religious, and took the Gentiles in the room of them, and so in just retaliation moved them to jealousy and wrath. It was displeasing to the carnal Jews to hear of the prophecies of the calling of the Gentiles, <a href="/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>; and the first display of grace to them was resented even by believing Jews themselves at first, <a href="/acts/11-2.htm">Acts 11:2</a>. The anger of the Scribes and Pharisees on this account is thought by some to be hinted at in the parable of the two sons, <a href="/luke/15-27.htm">Luke 15:27</a>.

"But Righteous-nation became fat, and struck out - thou becamest fat, thick, gross - and let go God who made him, and despised the rock of his salvation." So much is certain concerning Jeshurun, that it was an honourable surname given to Israel; that it is derived from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and describes Israel as a nation of just or right men (a similar description to that given by Balaam in <a href="/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>), because Jehovah, who is just and right (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>), had called it to uprightness, to walk in His righteousness, and chosen it as His servant (<a href="/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>). The prevalent opinion, that Jeshurun is a diminutive, and signifies rectalus, or "little pious" (Ges. and others), has no more foundation than the derivation from Israel, and the explanation, "little Israel," since there is no philological proof that the termination un ever had a diminutive signification in Hebrew (see Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 415); and an appellatio blanda et charitativa is by no means suitable to this passage, much less to <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>. The epithet Righteous-nation, as we may render Jeshurun, was intended to remind Israel of its calling, and involved the serverest reproof of its apostasy. "By placing the name of righteous before Israel, he censured ironically those who had fallen away from righteousness; and by thus reminding them with what dignity they had been endowed, he upbraided them with the more severity for their guilt of perfidy. For in other places (sc., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>) Israel is honoured with an eulogium of the same kind, without any such sinister meaning, but with simple regard to its calling; whilst here Moses shows reproachfully how far they had departed from that pursuit of piety, to the cultivation of which they had been called" (Calvin). The words, "became fat, and struck out," are founded upon the figure of an ox that had become fat, and intractable in consequence (vid., <a href="/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>). To sharpen this reproof, Moses repeats the thought in the form of a direct address to the people: "Thou hast become fat, stout, gross." Becoming fat led to forsaking God, the Creator and ground of its salvation. "A full stomach does not promote piety, for it stands secure, and neglects God" (Luther). &#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; is no doubt a denom. verb from &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, lit., to treat as a fool, i.e., to despise (vid., Micah. Deu 7:6).</body></html>
