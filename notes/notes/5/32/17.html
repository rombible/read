They indulged their appetites, as if they had nothing to do but to make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it. Those who make a god of themselves, and a god of their bellies, in pride and wantonness, and cannot bear to be told of it, thereby forsake God, and show they esteem him lightly. There is but one way of a sinner's acceptance and sanctification, however different modes of irreligion, or false religion, may show that favourable regard for other ways, which is often miscalled candid.

Under the figure of an eagle, which teaches its young to fly, and in doing so protects them from injury with watchful affection, Moses describes the care with which the Lord came to the relief of His people in their helplessness, and assisted them to develop their strength. This figure no doubt refers more especially to the protection and assistance of God experienced by Israel in its journey through the Arabian desert; but it must not be restricted to this. It embraces both the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt by the outstretched arm of the Lord, as we may see from a comparison with <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>, where the Lord is said to have brought His people out of Egypt upon eagles' wings, and also the introduction into Canaan, when the Lord drove the Canaanites out from before them and destroyed them. This verse contains an independent thought; the first half is the protasis, the second the apodosis. The nominative to "spreadeth abroad" is Jehovah; and the suffixes in &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; ("taketh" and "beareth") refer to Israel or Jacob (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>), like the suffixes in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>. As &#1499;&#1468; cannot open a sentence like &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, we must supply the relative &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; after &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, to waken up, rouse up its nest, i.e., to encourage the young ones to fly. It is rendered correctly by the Vulgate, provocans ad volandum pullos suos; and freely by Luther, "bringeth out its young." "Soareth over its young:" namely, in order that, when they were attempting to fly, if any were in danger of falling through exhaustion, it might take them at once upon its powerful wings, and preserve them from harm. Examples of this, according to the popular belief, are given by Bochart (Hieroz. ii. p. 762). &#1512;&#1495;&#1507;, from &#1512;&#1495;&#1507; to be loose or slack (<a href="/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>): in the Piel it is applied to a bird in the sense of loosening its wings, as distinguished from binding its wings to its body; hence (1) to sit upon eggs with loosened wings, and (2) to fly with loosened wings. Here it is used in the latter sense, because the young are referred to. The point of comparison between the conduct of God towards Jacob and the acts of an eagle towards its young, is the loving care with which He trained Israel to independence. The carrying of Israel upon the eagle's wings of divine love and omnipotence was manifested in the most glorious way in the guidance of it by the pillar of cloud and fire, though it was not so exclusively in this visible vehicle of the gracious presence of God as that the comparison can be restricted to this phenomenon alone. Luther's interpretation is more correct than this - "Moses points out in these words, how He fostered them in the desert, bore with their manners, tried them and blessed them that they might learn to fly, i.e., to trust in Him," - except that the explanation of the expression "to fly" is narrowed too much.</body></html>
