There is no ground for the explanation "fery wine" (Keil); wine in such a state was never among the Hebrews counted a blessing.

Moses commences his enumeration of the manifestations of divine mercy with the thought, that from the very commencement of the forming of nations God had cared for His people Israel. The meaning of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> is given in general correctly by Calvin: "In the whole arrangement of the world God had kept this before Him as the end: to consult the interests of His chosen people." The words, "when the Most High portioned out inheritance to the nations," etc., are not to be restricted to the one fact of the confusion of tongues and division of the nations as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, but embrace the whole period of the development of the one human family in separate tribes and nations, together with their settlement in different lands; for it is no doctrine of the Israelitish legend, as Kamphausen supposes, that the division of the nations was completed once for all. The book of Genesis simply teaches, that after the confusion of tongues at the building of the tower of Babel, God scattered men over the entire surface of the earth (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-9.htm">Deuteronomy 11:9</a>), and that the nations were divided, i.e., separate nations were formed from the families of the sons of Noah (<a href="/genesis/10-32.htm">Genesis 10:32</a>); that is to say, the nations were formed in the divinely-appointed way of generation and multiplication, and so spread over the earth. And the Scriptures say nothing about a division of the countries among the different nations at one particular time; they simply show, that, like the formation of the nations from families and tribes, the possession of the lands by the nations so formed was to be traced to God, - was the work of divine providence and government, - whereby God so determined the boundaries of the nations ("the nations" are neither the tribes of Israel, nor simply the nations round about Canaan, but the nations generally), that Israel might receive as its inheritance a land proportioned to its numbers.<p>(Note: The Septuagint rendering, "according to the number of the angels of God," is of no critical value, - in fact, is nothing more than an arbitrary interpretation founded upon the later Jewish notion of guardian angels of the different nations (Sir. 17:14), which probably originated in a misunderstanding of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, as compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-20.htm">Daniel 10:20-21</a>, and <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>.)</body></html>
