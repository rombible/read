But He spared Israel, and continues them still to be living witnesses of the truth of the Bible, and to silence unbelievers. They are preserved for wise and holy purposes and the prophecies give us some idea what those purposes are. The Lord will never disgrace the throne of his glory. It is great wisdom, and will help much to the return of sinners to God, seriously to consider their latter end, or the future state. It is here meant particularly of what God foretold by Moses, about this people in the latter days; but it may be applied generally. Oh that men would consider the happiness they will lose, and the misery they will certainly plunge into, if they go on in their trespasses! What will be in the end thereof? Jer 5:31. For the Lord will in due time bring down the enemies of the church, in displeasure against their wickedness. When sinners deem themselves most secure, they suddenly fall into destruction. And God's time to appear for the deliverance of his people, is when things are at the worst with them. But those who trust to any rock but God, will find it fail them when they most need it. The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish nation, is the continuance of their ancient idolatry, apostacy, and rebellion. They shall be brought to humble themselves before the Lord, to repent of their sins, and to trust in their long-rejected Mediator for salvation. Then he will deliver them, and make their prosperity great.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Repent himself for - Rather, have compassion upon.

The true church and members of it, in opposition to the false and apostate church; his chosen and covenant people, whom he gave to Christ, and who are redeemed by his blood, and effectually called by his grace; the people he shall call out of Babylon, or preserve from the corruptions of it before its fall; and who are the objects of his love and delight; a distinct, peculiar, and special people, near unto him, and all righteous: these he will judge at this time, distinguish between them and the followers of antichrist; he will take their cause in hand, and plead it, and do justice to them; he will right their wrongs and injuries, and take vengeance on their enemies; he will protect and defend them, reign and rule over them. Now will be the time, when the witnesses slain are raised, that he will take to himself his great power and reign, and the time of the dead when they will be judged, and a reward given to his servants and prophets, to his saints, and all that fear his name; and when he will destroy them that have destroyed the earth, <a href="/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>; so the Targum of Jonathan interprets this of the word of the Lord that shall judge his people in mercy: <p>and repent himself for his servants; by whom are meant not only the ministers of the Gospel, his witnesses that prophesy in sackcloth, and who will be slain when they have finished their testimony; but all that are effectually called by grace, who though they have been the servants of sin, and the vassals of Satan, yet by the grace of God become the servants of God and of righteousness; dislike and cast off their old masters; readily, willingly, and cheerfully, take upon them the yoke of Christ, and freely obey him, constrained by his love, and influenced by views of interest in him: and so serve him without any selfish views, owning that, when they have done all they can, they are but unprofitable servants: now for or on account of these he will repent himself, because of the evils he has suffered to come upon them, being moved with pity, and compassion to them in their miserable circumstances, as they will be in when the witnesses his servants will be slain; not that, properly speaking, repentance is in God; he never changes his mind, counsel, and purposes; he never alters his love, his choice, nor his covenant; or repents of his gifts, and calling of special grace; though he is sometimes said to repent of outward good things he has bestowed, or promised to bestow conditionality; and of evils he has threatened or inflicted; yet this is only to be understood of a change of his outward dealings and dispensations with men, according to his changeable will; and this will be the case now with respect to his servants, whom he will have suffered to be slain, and lie unburied; but repenting or changing his manner of conduct to them will revive them, and cause them to ascend to heaven; see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/11-11.htm">Revelation 11:11</a>, <p>when he seeth that their power is gone; not the hand and power of the enemy, going and prevailing over them, and strong upon them, as the Targum of Jonathan and Jarchi; but rather the hand and power of the righteous, as the Targum of Jerusalem; and respects not their internal power and strength, which they have not in themselves, but in Christ; though the exertion of that power, and the exercise of their graces, as faith, and hope, and love, will be greatly declined; but their external power, and protection which they had from Protestant princes; they being removed, and others not like them succeeding, or apostatizing to the church of Rome: the outward court or national establishments are a fence and protection to the inward court worshippers, or servants of God; when that shall be given to the Gentiles, the Papists, as it will, <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>; the power or hand, the protecting sheltering hand of the saints, will be gone, and they will become a prey to their adversaries: <p>and there is none shut up or left; a phrase used to express the miserable state and condition of a people, when none are left, but all are carried off, or cut off, and destroyed, and there is none to help them; see <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; when there are none shut up in garrisons, and left there to defend a people; or there are none shut up in prison, or any left to till the ground; which is sometimes the case when a nation is conquered, and the greater part are carried captives; but it denotes such a general destruction, that there are none remaining any where, and thus it will be at the slaying of the witnesses. This passage has respect to their dead bodies, which will not be shut up in graves, nor any left to bury them, <a href="/revelation/11-9.htm">Revelation 11:9</a>. There will scarcely be a professor of religion, or any that will appear to favour the witnesses slain in any respect; there will be"none to support and uphold,''as the Targum of Jerusalem; not to support and uphold the true religion, or to help the people of God in these their distresses: and when the Lord shall see all this, he will look upon them with an eye of pity and compassion; he will repent for his servants, according to the multitude of his tender mercies; and will plead their cause, and judge them, and will put on the garments of vengeance, and repay fury and recompense to his and their enemies, <a href="/isaiah/59-15.htm">Isaiah 59:15</a>; who will insultingly say as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that <i>their</i> power is gone, and <i>there is</i> none <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> shut up, or left.</span><p>(s) When neither strong nor weak in a manner remain.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>36 For the Lord shall judge for His people,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And relent for His servants’ sake,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When He sees that their grip is gone,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor fast nor free remaineth;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>37 And shall say, Where be their gods<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The rock whereon they refuged,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>38 Which ate the fat of their sacrifice,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Drank the wine of their pouring?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let them arise to your help,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let them be a covert above you!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">36</span>. <span class="ital">judge his people</span>] As the parallel line shows, this means ‘will judge for his people.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">power</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">hand</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">hold</span> or <span class="ital">grip</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">nor fast nor free</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">‘aṣûr we ‘azûb</span>, an alliterative phrase for the whole population.

The words rendered "shut up or left" are a proverbial expression for "every one, men of all sorts" (cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-26.htm">2 Kings 14:26</a>); but how the words are to be rendered or explained is uncertain. Rosenm&uuml;ller renders as in the Authorized Version; Gesenius has, "the shut up and the let go free, the bond and the flee;" so also Furst and De Wette; De Dieu, "married and single, <span class="accented">conjugatus et coelebs</span>," referring to the Arabic usage in support of his conclusion ('Animad. in Ver.

Israel could have put all its enemies to flight were it not that its God had given it entirely up to them (sold them as slaves). The supposition that this had already occurred by no means proves, as Kamphausen believes, "that the poet was speaking of the existing state of the nation," but merely that Moses thinks of the circumstances as certain to occur when the people should have forsaken their God. The past implied in the verbs "sold" and "given up" is a prophetically idea past or present, but not a real and historical one. The assertion of Hupfeld and Kamphausen, that &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;, as used with special reference to the giving up of a nation into the power of the heathen, "belongs to a somewhat later usage of the language," is equally groundless.</body></html>
