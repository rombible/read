After careful consideration of the passage with a learned Christian Hebrew,<span class= "note">[6]</span> I venture to propound this as the true translation. It is <span class= "ital">substantially </span>identical with that of the English margin. The Hebrew consists of five words only (1) “He-hath-corrupted (2) to-him (3) not (4) his-sons (5) their blemish.” That the first two ought to be taken together, if the text is correct, seems certain. The same construction is found in <a href="/numbers/32-15.htm" title="For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you shall destroy all this people.">Numbers 32:15</a>, “ye shall destroy all this people,” and also in <a href="/1_samuel/23-10.htm" title="Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.">1Samuel 23:10</a>, “to destroy the city.” As to the third and fourth words, we have thought that their true relation is the same which we find in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, a “not-God,” and a “not-people,” and also in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>, <span class= "ital">“</span>not-wise.” In like manner Israel are in this verse called “not-sons of His.” Their not-sonship, their unfilial, undutiful, ungodly behaviour to Him who is the perfection of truth and sincerity, a very Rock of fidelity to them, that is their great blemish. He has said, “Israel is my son, even my firstborn.” But all Israel’s behaviour gives Him the lie. The contrast between the two descriptions—the faithful God of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, and the unfaithful children of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>—is the cardinal point in the verse. In the form of the expression, <span class= "ital">lo</span>-<span class= "ital">bânâv </span>is strictly parallel to the <span class= "ital">Lo-ammi </span>of <a href="/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>. The “<span class= "ital">froward </span>and <span class= "ital">crooked </span>generation” supplies two words to <a href="/psalms/18-26.htm" title="With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the fraudulent you will show yourself devious.">Psalm 18:26</a>, “with the <span class= "ital">froward </span>thou wilt <span class= "ital">shew thyself froward” </span>Compare also the context of the two passages. Many other interpretations have been proposed, and some have altered the text. I believe the text to be correct, and that this is the true meaning.<p><span class= "note">[6] Mr. Bernhard Maimon, to whom I desire once for all to express my great obligations for assistance in this and many other difficulties.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.">Deuteronomy 32:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">They have corrupted themselves — </span>Notwithstanding that God hath fully displayed these excellences in his dealings with the Israelitish nation, yet how corrupt and ungrateful hath been their behaviour! <span class="ital">Their spot — </span>The wickedness with which they are stained; <span class="ital">is not of his children — </span>Plainly shows they are not his children, but of their father the devil, <a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.

The Hebrew <span class="greekheb">לא בניו מומם</span><span class="ital">lo banau, mumam, </span>may be properly rendered as in the margin, or, as Le Clerc has it, according to the Samaritan version, <span class="ital">the sons of pollution are not his. </span>The true characteristic of the sons of God is to imitate and resemble God, <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>. It is true they are not without infirmities of various kinds, from which none dwelling in flesh are exempt. But they do not give that name to known sin, which they are always careful to avoid, and to walk in all well-pleasing before God. On the contrary, the Israelites are here denominated <span class="ital">a perverse and crooked generation; </span>froward and untractable; irregular and disorderly. In opposition to such characters the sons of God are described (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Php 2:15</a>) as “being blameless and harmless in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, shining as lights in the world, and holding forth the word of life.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:3-6 He is a Rock. This is the first time God is called so in Scripture. The expression denotes that the Divine power, faithfulness, and love, as revealed in Christ and the gospel, form a foundation which cannot be changed or moved, on which we may build our hopes of happiness. And under his protection we may find refuge from all our enemies, and in all our troubles; as the rocks in those countries sheltered from the burning rays of the sun, and from tempests, or were fortresses from the enemy. His work is perfect: that of redemption and salvation, in which there is a display of all the Divine perfection, complete in all its parts. All God's dealings with his creatures are regulated by wisdom which cannot err, and perfect justice. He is indeed just and right; he takes care that none shall lose by him. A high charge is exhibited against Israel. Even God's children have their spots, while in this imperfect state; for if we say we have no sin, no spot, we deceive ourselves. But the sin of Israel was not habitual, notorious, unrepented sin; which is a certain mark of the children of Satan. They were fools to forsake their mercies for lying vanities.

This and what follows may seem to be the characters of the enemies of Christ, who lightly esteemed and rejected him, set in a contrast with him; who were not only corrupt by nature, as all men are, but were men of corrupt minds in their tenets and principles; who corrupted the word of God by their traditions, in the times of Christ; and were men of corrupt practices themselves, and corrupters of others: <p>their spot is not the spot of his children; of the children of the divine Person before described; Christ the rock has "children" given him by his Father, in whose adoption he has a concern, and by whose Spirit they are regenerated: these have their "spots"; by which are meant sins, and by those men are stained and polluted; so called in allusion to the spots of animals, as leopards; or to spots in faces and garments, through dirt and the like: by nature they are as others, and while in an unregenerate estate, and indeed after conversion; though they are washed from their sins by the blood of Christ, and are justified by his righteousness, and so without spot, yet in themselves they are not without spots or sins, as their confessions and complaints, and all experience testify: but the spots or sins of wicked men are not like theirs; the children of Christ sin through infirmity of the flesh, and the force of temptation, but wicked men through the malignity of their hearts, willingly and purposely; what good men do of this kind they hate, but what Christless and graceless sinners do they love; saints do not continue in sin, but ungodly men do, and proceed to more ungodliness, and wax worse and worse; gracious souls when they sin, are sorry for it, repent of it, are melted for it, and take shame to themselves on account of it; but unconverted men repent not of their wickedness, are hardened in it, and glory of it; see the character of the Jews in Christ's time, to which this song refers, <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>; though these clauses may be rendered to another sense, more agreeably to the context, and to the Hebrew accents, as they are by some; "is there any corruption in him? no" (n), that is, is there any corruption in the illustrious Person before described, as without iniquity, just, and right? no, none at all in his nature, divine or human; not in his divine nature, being the incorruptible God; nor in his human nature, which is entirely free from that corruption by sin, common to all that des, tend from Adam by natural generation, he being conceived under the power of the Holy Ghost; nor any in his life and conversation, being perfectly agreeable to the pure and holy law of God; nor any in his doctrines, however they may be charged by ignorant and malicious men, a proof of which follows: or "his children are their spot" (o); so the clause may be rendered; the spots of the Jewish nation, the most wicked and vilest among them, became his children; not only the lowest and meanest of them, as to civil and worldly things, but the more ignorant and the more wicked, even publicans and harlots; these, and not the righteous, he came to call and save, and did receive; these were regenerated by his grace, and they believed in him; and to them gave he power to become his children: but then did they remain the wicked persons they had been? no, they were made new creatures, they were internally sanctified, and lived holy lives and conversations; a clear proof this, that there was no corruption in Christ, nor in his doctrine, and that he neither by his tenets nor example encouraged sin, but all the reverse; Wisdom is justified of her children, <a href="/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; but then the rest, and the far greater part of the Jewish nation, in his time, have their character truly drawn, as follows: <p>they are a perverse and crooked generation; men of perverse and crooked natures, tempers, dispositions, ways, and works; who walked contrary to the will and law of God, and were indeed contrary to all men, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; this is the very character that is given of them, <a href="/matthew/17-17.htm">Matthew 17:17</a>. <p>(n)   "an est ipsi corruptio? non", Cocceius, van Till, Vitringa.
