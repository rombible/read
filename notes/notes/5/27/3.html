They must set up an altar. The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by the appointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar must be made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ, our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused by the builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the words of the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome us with horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erected close by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copies of the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods as were presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and the end of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain as possible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours with Divine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise unto salvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestly pray.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the words of this law - i. e. all the laws revealed from God to the people by Moses, regarded by the Jews as 613 (compare <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38</a> note). The exhibition of laws in this manner on stones, pillars, or tables, was familiar to the ancients. The laws were probably graven in the stone ("very plainly," <a href="/deuteronomy/27-8.htm">Deuteronomy 27:8</a> is by some rendered "scoop it out well"), as are for the most part the Egyptian hieroglyphics, the "plaister" being afterward added to protect the inscription from the weather. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law&#8212;It might be, as some think, the Decalogue; but a greater probability is that it was "the blessings and curses," which comprised in fact an epitome of the law (Jos 8:34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the words of this law; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Not the whole book of Deuteronomy, as some think, at least not the historical part of it, only what concerns the laws of God; and it may be only a summary or abstract of them, and perhaps only the ten commandments. Josephus (q) is of opinion that the blessings and the curses after recited were what were written on them: <p>when thou art passed over; that is, the river Jordan: <p>that thou mayest go in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; this account of the land of Canaan is so frequently observed, to imprint upon their minds a sense of the great goodness of God in giving them such a fruitful country, and to point out to them the obligation they lay under to observe the laws of God ordered to be written on plastered stones, as soon as they came into it: <p>as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee; <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>. <p>(q) Antiqu. l. 4. c. 8. sect. 44. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{b}</span> And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.</span><p>(b) God would have his law set up in the borders of the land of Canaan, that all that looked on it might know that the land was dedicated to his service.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the words of this law</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all the purely legislative parts of the Mosaic institute. By the "Law" here cannot be intended merely the blessings and the curses afterwards mentioned (vers. 14-26); nor is there any reason why this term should be restricted to the precepts of this Book of Deuteronomy, as if they only were to be inscribed on the stones: the term must be extended so as to cover all that Moses had at any time delivered to Israel as a law from God. It is not necessary, however, to suppose that <span class="accented">all</span> the reasons and exhortations with which the delivery of these, as recorded in the Pentateuch, was accompanied were to be inscribed along with the Law; still less that the historical details amidst which the record of these laws is embedded should be given. It may be questioned even whether <span class="accented">each</span> and <span class="accented">all</span> of the legislative enactments of the Torah, reckoned by the Jews to be 613, were to be recorded; for it might be deemed enough that the substance and essence of the Law should be thus presented. But even if the whole was to be inscribed, there would be no serious difficulty in the way of carrying this into effect, seeing there is no limitation as to the number of the stones to be set up. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the close of his discourse, Moses sums up the whole in the earnest admonition that Israel would give the Lord its God occasion to fulfil the promised glorification of His people, by keeping His commandments with all their heart and soul.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-16.htm">Deuteronomy 26:16-17</a><p>On this day the Lord commanded Israel to keep these laws and rights with all the heart and all the soul (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>.). There are two important points contained in this (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17</a>.). The acceptance of the laws laid before them on the part of the Israelites involved a practical declaration that the nation would accept Jehovah as its God, and walk in His way (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17</a>); and the giving of the law on the part of the Lord was a practical confirmation of His promise that Israel should be His people of possession, which He would glorify above all nations (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-18.htm">Deuteronomy 26:18</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>). "Thou hast let the Lord say to-day to be thy God," i.e., hast given Him occasion to say to thee that He will be thy God, manifest Himself to thee as thy God. "And to walk in His ways, and to keep His laws," etc., for "and that thou wouldst walk in His ways, and keep His laws." The acceptance of Jehovah as its God involved eo ipso a willingness to walk in His ways.</body></html>
