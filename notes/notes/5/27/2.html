They must set up an altar. The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by the appointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar must be made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ, our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused by the builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the words of the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome us with horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erected close by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copies of the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods as were presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and the end of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain as possible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours with Divine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise unto salvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestly pray.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stones here named are not those of which the altar <a href="/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5</a> was to be built, but are to serve as a separate monument witnessing to the fact that the people took possession of the land by virtue of the Law inscribed on them and with an acknowledgment of its obligations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan&#8212;"Day" is often put for "time"; and it was not till some days after the passage that the following instructions were acted upon.<p>thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister&#8212;These stones were to be taken in their natural state, unhewn, and unpolished&#8212;the occasion on which they were used not admitting of long or elaborate preparation; and they were to be daubed over with paint or whitewash, to render them more conspicuous.

The practice was Egyptian, and in Egypt the climate was not hostile to the result.

How much is comprised in this phrase we cannot say, for we are not sure of the exact size of the original code of D.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It was a widespread custom in antiquity to engrave laws upon stone pillars. The Code of Ḫammurabi is engraved on a pillar of black diorite in ‘about 49 columns, 4000 lines and 8000 words’ (Johns, Hastings’ <span class="ital">D.B.</span>, Extra Vol.). The local tariff of Palmyra contains about 260 lines in Greek and 163 in Aramaic (Cooke, <span class="ital">N. Semit. Inscr.</span> 313 ff.). The regulations for sacrifices at Carthage (<span class="ital">CIS.</span> i. i. 166 ff.) were graven on stone. For Greece cp.

That the words were not, as Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, and others suppose, cut in the stone, and afterwards covered with plaster in order to preserve them, is plain from its being enjoined that they were to be written upon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>) the stones so prepared; and besides, as this was intended to be a <span class="accented">proclamation</span> of the Law, the main purpose of the erection would have been frustrated had the inscription been concealed by such a covering as that supposed. Among the ancient Egyptians the practice of depicting records on walls or monuments covered with a coating of plaster was common (see Hengstenberg, 'Authentic des Pent.,' 1:464, English translation, 1:433); from them, doubtless, it was borrowed by the Hebrews. It has been suggested by Kennicott that the writing was to be in <span class="accented">relieve</span>, and that the spaces between the letters were filled up by the mortar or cement. This is possible, but it is not such a process as this that the words of the text suggest. "A careful examination of <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4, 8</a>, and <a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30</a>-22, will lead to the opinion that the Law was <span class="accented">written upon</span> or <span class="accented">in the plaster</span> with which these pillars were coated. This could easily be done, and such writing was common in ancient times. I have seen specimens of it certainly more than <span class="accented">two thousand years old</span>, and still as distinct as when they were first inscribed on the plaster" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' it. p. 204). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I have not eaten thereof in my sorrow." &#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, from &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, tribulation, distress, signifies here in all probability mourning, and judging from what follows, mourning for the dead, equivalent to "in a mourning condition," i.e., in a state of legal (Levitical) uncleanness; so that &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; really corresponded to the &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1502;&#1488; which follows, except that &#1496;&#1502;&#1488; includes every kind of legal uncleanness. "I have removed nothing thereof as unclean," i.e., while in the state of an unclean person. Not only not eaten of any, but not removed any of it from the house, carried it away in an unclean state, in which they were forbidden to touch the holy gifts (<a href="/leviticus/22-3.htm">Leviticus 22:3</a>). "And not given (any) of it on account of the dead." This most probably refers to the custom of sending provisions into a house of mourning, to prepare meals for the mourners (<a href="/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-4.htm">Hosea 9:4</a>; Tobit 4:17). A house of mourning, with its inhabitants, was regarded as unclean; consequently nothing could be carried into it of that which was sanctified. There is no good ground for thinking of idolatrous customs, or of any special superstition attached to the bread of mourning; nor is there any ground for understanding the words as referring to the later Jewish custom of putting provisions into the grave along with the corpse, to which the Septuagint rendering, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, points.
