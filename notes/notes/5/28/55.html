Yet these are but the beginning of sorrows to those under the curse of God. What then will be the misery of that world where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched! Observe what is here said of the wrath of God, which should come and remain upon the Israelites for their sins. It is amazing to think that a people so long the favourites of Heaven, should be so cast off; and yet that a people so scattered in all nations should be kept distinct, and not mixed with others. If they would not serve God with cheerfulness, they should be compelled to serve their enemies. We may justly expect from God, that if we do not fear his fearful name, we shall feel his fearful plagues; for one way or other God will be feared. The destruction threatened is described. They have, indeed, been plucked from off the land, ver. 63. Not only by the Babylonish captivity, and when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans; but afterwards, when they were forbidden to set foot in Jerusalem. They should have no rest; no rest of body, ver. 65, but be continually on the remove, either in hope of gain, or fear of persecution. No rest of the mind, which is much worse. They have been banished from city to city, from country to country; recalled, and banished again. These events, compared with the favour shown to Israel in ancient times, and with the prophecies about them, should not only excite astonishment, but turn unto us for a testimony, assuring us of the truth of Scripture. And when the other prophecies of their conversion to Christ shall come to pass, the whole will be a sign and a wonder to all the nations of the earth, and the forerunner of a general spread of true christianity. The fulfilling of these prophecies upon the Jewish nation, delivered more than three thousand years ago, shows that Moses spake by the Spirit of God; who not only foresees the ruin of sinners, but warns of it, that they may prevent it by a true and timely repentance, or else be left without excuse. And let us be thankful that Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, by being made a curse for us, and bearing in his own person all that punishment which our sins merit, and which we must otherwise have endured for ever. To this Refuge and salvation let sinners flee; therein let believers rejoice, and serve their reconciled God with gladness of heart, for the abundance of his spiritual blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Evil - i. e. grudging; compare <a href="/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53-57.

"From afar" is still further strengthened by the addition of the words, "from the end of the earth." The greater the distance off, the more terrible does the foe appear. He flies thence like an eagle, which plunges with violence upon its prey, and carries it off with its claws; and Israel does not understand its language, so as to be able to soften its barbarity, or come to any terms. A people "firm, hard of face," i.e., upon whom nothing makes an impression (vid., <a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>), - a description of the audacity and shamelessness of its appearance (<a href="/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>; cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-13.htm">Proverbs 7:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-29.htm">Proverbs 21:29</a>), which spares neither old men nor boys. This description no doubt applies to the Chaldeans, who are described as flying eagles in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>., <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-7.htm">Ezekiel 17:7</a>, as in the verses before us; but it applies to other enemies of Israel beside these, namely to the great imperial powers generally, the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Romans, whom the Lord raised up as the executors of His curse upon His rebellious people. Isaiah therefore depicts the Assyrians in a similar manner, namely, as a people with an unintelligible language (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>), and describes the cruelty of the Medes in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">Deuteronomy 13:17-18</a>, with an unmistakeable allusion to <a href="/deuteronomy/28-50.htm">Deuteronomy 28:50</a> of the present threat.</body></html>
