Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mental maladies shah be added to those sore bodily plagues, and should <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29-34</a> reduce the sufferers to powerlessness before their enemies and oppressors.<p>Blindness - Most probably mental blindness; compare <a href="/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> ff.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-33. thou shalt grope at noonday&#8212;a general description of the painful uncertainty in which they would live.
