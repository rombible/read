Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mental maladies shah be added to those sore bodily plagues, and should <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29-34</a> reduce the sufferers to powerlessness before their enemies and oppressors.<p>Blindness - Most probably mental blindness; compare <a href="/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> ff.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart&#8212;They would be bewildered and paralyzed with terror at the extent of their calamities.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Blindness, </span> to wit, of mind, so that they shall not know what to do; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/job/5-13.htm" title="He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the fraudulent is carried headlong.">Job 5:13</a>,14</span>; so as they shall commonly choose and follow the worst counsels and courses, to their own ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Astonishment of heart; </span> they shall be filled with wonder and horror, because of the strangeness and soreness of their calamities. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord shall smite thee with madness,....

First of all, quite generally in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>. "The Lord will send the curse against thee, consternation and threatening in every undertaking of thy hand which thou carriest out (see <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>), till thou be destroyed, till thou perish quickly, because of the wickedness of thy doings, because thou hast forsaken Me." The three words, &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, and &#1502;&#1490;&#1506;&#1512;&#1514;, are synonymous, and are connected together to strengthen the thought. &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1492;, curse or malediction; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, the consternation produced by the curse of God, namely, the confusion with which God smites His foes (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/7-23.htm">Deuteronomy 7:23</a>); &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; is the threatening word of the divine wrath. - Then <a href="/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21</a>. in detail. "The Lord will make the pestilence fasten upon (cleave to) thee, till He hath destroyed thee out of the land...to smite thee with giddiness and fever (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>), inflammation, burning, and sword, blasting of corn, and mildew (of the seed);" seven diseases therefore (seven as the stamp of the words of God), whilst pestilence in particular is mentioned first, as the most terrible enemy of life. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511; to burn, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1495;&#1512;, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512; to glow, signify inflammatory diseases, burning fevers; the distinction between these and &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; cannot be determined. Instead of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, the sword as the instrument of death, used to designate slaughter and death, the Vulgate, Arabic, and Samaritan have adopted the reading &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, aestus, heat (<a href="/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>), or drought, according to which there would be four evils mentioned by which human life is attacked, and three which are injurious to the corn. But as the lxx, Jon., Syr., and others read &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, this alteration is very questionable, especially as the reading can be fully defended in this connection; and one objection to the alteration is, that drought is threatened for the first time in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-24.htm">Deuteronomy 28:24</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1507; to singe or blacken, and &#1497;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1503;, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1511; to be yellowish, refer to two diseases which attack the corn: the former to the withering or burning of the ears, caused by the east wind (<a href="/genesis/41-23.htm">Genesis 41:23</a>); the other to the effect produced by a warm wind in Arabia, by which the green ears are turned yellow, so that they bear no grains of corn.</body></html>
