Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The curses correspond in form and number <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-19</a> to the blessings <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3-6</a>, and the special modes in which these threats should be executed are described in five groups of denunciations <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20-68</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-20.

The Lord had called Israel as a holy nation, when He concluded the covenant with it (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). This promise, to which the words "as He hath sworn unto thee" point back, and which is called an oath, because it was founded upon the promises given to the patriarchs on oath (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>), and was given implicite in them, the Lord would fulfil to His people, and cause the holiness and glory of Israel to be so clearly manifested, that all nations should perceive or see "that the name of the Lord is named upon Israel." The name of the Lord is the revelation of His glorious nature. It is named upon Israel, when Israel is transformed into the glory of the divine nature (cf. <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). It was only in feeble commencements that this blessing was fulfilled upon Israel under the Old Testament; and it is not till the restoration of Israel, which is to take place in the future according to <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>., that its complete fulfilment will be attained. In <a href="/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>, Moses returns to the earthly blessing, for the purpose of unfolding this still further. "Superabundance will the Lord give thee for good (i.e., for happiness and prosperity; vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/30-9.htm">Deuteronomy 30:9</a>), in fruit of thy body," etc. (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>). He would open His good treasure-house, the heaven, to give rain to the land in its season (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4-5</a>), and bless the work of the hands, i.e., the cultivation of the soil, so that Israel would be able to lend to many, according to the prospect already set before it in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-6.htm">Deuteronomy 15:6</a>.</body></html>
