They are real things and have real effects. The blessings are here put before the curses. God is slow to anger, but swift to show mercy. It is his delight to bless. It is better that we should be drawn to what is good by a child-like hope of God's favour, than that we be frightened to it by a slavish fear of his wrath. The blessing is promised, upon condition that they diligently hearken to the voice of God. Let them keep up religion, the form and power of it, in their families and nation, then the providence of God would prosper all their outward concerns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The oath with which God vouchsafed to confirm His promises to the patriarchs (compare <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-14</a>) contained by implication these gifts of holiness and eminence to Israel (compare the marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14. the head, and not the tail&#8212;an Oriental form of expression, indicating the possession of independent power and great dignity and acknowledged excellence (Isa 9:14; 19:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day,....
