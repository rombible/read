They are real things and have real effects. The blessings are here put before the curses. God is slow to anger, but swift to show mercy. It is his delight to bless. It is better that we should be drawn to what is good by a child-like hope of God's favour, than that we be frightened to it by a slavish fear of his wrath. The blessing is promised, upon condition that they diligently hearken to the voice of God.

If Israel would hearken to the voice of the Lord its God, the Lord would make it the highest of all the nations of the earth. This thought, with which the discourse on the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> terminated, forms the theme, and in a certain sense the heading, of the following description of the blessing, through which the Lord, according to the more distinct declaration in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>, would glorify His people above all the nations of the earth. The indispensable condition for obtaining this blessing, was obedience to the word of the Lord, or keeping His commandments. To impress this condition sine qua non thoroughly upon the people, Moses not only repeats it at the commencement (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>), and in the middle (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-9.htm">Deuteronomy 28:9</a>), but also at the close (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>), in both a positive and a negative form. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>, "the way in which Israel was to be exalted is pointed out" (Schultz); and thus the theme is more precisely indicated, and the elaboration of it is introduced. "All these blessings (those mentioned singly in what follows) will come upon thee and reach thee." The blessings are represented as actual powers, which follow the footsteps of the nation, and overtake it. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3-6</a>, the fulness of the blessing of God in all the relations of life is depicted in a sixfold repetition of the word "blessed." Israel will be blessed in the town and in the field, the two spheres in which its life moves (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3</a>); blessed will be the fruit of the body, of the earth, and of the cattle, i.e., in all its productions (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>; for each one, see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13-14</a>); blessed will be the basket (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>) in which the fruits are kept, and the kneading - trough (<a href="/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>) in which the daily bread is prepared (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-5.htm">Deuteronomy 28:5</a>); blessed will the nation be in all its undertakings ("coming in and going out;" vid., <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>).</body></html>
