And it suits with what follows. “The Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.”<p>(3) <span class= "bld">The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee . . .

This is applied by the apostle to all God's spiritual Israel, to encourage their faith and hope; unto us is this gospel preached, as well as unto them; he will never fail thee, nor forsake thee, Heb 13:5. Moses commends Joshua to them for a leader; one whose wisdom, and courage, and affection they had long known; one whom God had appointed to be their leader; and therefore would own and bless. Joshua is well pleased to be admonished by Moses to be strong and of good courage. Those shall speed well, who have God with them; therefore they ought to be of good courage.

Moses went and spake&#8212;It is probable that this rehearsal of the law extended over several successive days; and it might be the last and most important day on which the return of Moses to the place of assembly is specially noticed. In drawing his discourse towards a conclusion, he adverted to his advanced age; and although neither his physical nor intellectual powers had suffered any decay (De 34:7), yet he knew, by a special revelation, that the time had arrived when he was about to be withdrawn from the superintendence and government of Israel.Moses declares to the people his approaching death, and encourageth them, and Joshua, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/deuteronomy/31-1.htm" title="And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel....">Deu 31:1-8</a></span>.

The following words, even to the whole body of the people summoned together on this occasion. It seems that after Moses had made the covenant with them he was directed to, he dismissed the people to their tents, and went to his own, and now returned, having ordered them to meet him again, very probably at the tabernacle; with which agrees the Targum of Jonathan, he"went to the tabernacle of the house of doctrine;''though, according to Aben Ezra, he went to the each tribes separately, as they lay encamped; his words are these,"he went to every tribe and tribe, to acquaint them that he was about to die, and that they might not be afraid, and to strengthen their hearts;''he adds,"in my opinion he then blessed them, though their blessings are afterwards written;''which is not improbable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">went and spake these words</span>] This can only refer to something preceding; see small print above.

The meaning is not that he "went away" into the tent of teaching, as one of the Targums explains it (London Polyglot, tom. 4. p. 377), which does not agree with what follows; nor is "went" merely equivalent to "moreover;" nor is it simply redundant; - it intimates that the speaking was consequent on Moses having arranged, disposed, or set himself to speak (cf. <a href="/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4</a>; <a href="/job/1-4.htm">Job 1:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In conclusion, Moses sums up the contents of the whole of this preaching of the law in the words, "life and good, and death and evil," as he had already done at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-27</a>, in the first part of this address, to lay the people by a solemn adjuration under the obligation to be faithful to the Lord, and through this obligation to conclude the covenant afresh. He had set before them this day life and good ("good"  equals  prosperity and salvation), as well as death and evil (&#1512;&#1506;, adversity and destruction), by commanding them to love the Lord and walk in His ways. Love is placed first, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, as being the essential principle of the fulfilment of the commandments. Expounding the law was setting before them life and death, salvation and destruction, because the law, as the word of God, was living and powerful, and proved itself in every man a power of life or of death, according to the attitude which he assumed towards it (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>). &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;, to permit oneself to be torn away to idolatry (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>). </body></html>
