This is applied by the apostle to all God's spiritual Israel, to encourage their faith and hope; unto us is this gospel preached, as well as unto them; he will never fail thee, nor forsake thee, Heb 13:5. Moses commends Joshua to them for a leader; one whose wisdom, and courage, and affection they had long known; one whom God had appointed to be their leader; and therefore would own and bless. Joshua is well pleased to be admonished by Moses to be strong and of good courage. Those shall speed well, who have God with them; therefore they ought to be of good courage.

Love is placed first, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, as being the essential principle of the fulfilment of the commandments. Expounding the law was setting before them life and death, salvation and destruction, because the law, as the word of God, was living and powerful, and proved itself in every man a power of life or of death, according to the attitude which he assumed towards it (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>). &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;, to permit oneself to be torn away to idolatry (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>). </body></html>
