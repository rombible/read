This solemn reading of the law must be done in the year of release. The year of release was typical of gospel grace, which is called the acceptable year of the Lord; for our pardon and liberty by Christ, engage us to keep his commandments. It must be read to all Israel, men, women, children, and to the strangers. It is the will of God that all people should acquaint themselves with his word. It is a rule to all, therefore should be read to all. Whoever has read of the pains taken by many persons to get scraps of the Scriptures, when a whole copy could not be obtained, or safely possessed, will see how thankful we should be for the thousands of copies amongst us. They will also understand the very different situation in which the Israelites were placed for many ages. But the heart of man is so careless, that all will be found too little, to keep up a knowledge of the truths, precepts, and worship of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references. It is not to be supposed that the whole of the Pentateuch was read, nor does the letter of the command require that it should be so. This reading could not be primarily designed for the information and instruction of the people, since it only took place once in seven years; but was evidently a symbolic transaction, intended, as were so many others, to impress on the people the conditions on which they held possession of their privileges and blessings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11. At the end of every seven years, &#8230; thou shalt read this law&#8212;At the return of the sabbatic year and during the feast of tabernacles, the law was to be publicly read. This order of Moses was a future and prospective arrangement; for the observance of the sabbatic year did not commence till the conquest and peaceful occupation of Canaan. The ordinance served several important purposes. For, while the people had opportunities of being instructed in the law every Sabbath and daily in their own homes, this public periodical rehearsal at meetings in the courts of the sanctuary, where women and children of twelve years were present (as they usually were at the great festivals), was calculated to produce good and pious impressions of divine truth amid the sacred associations of the time and place. Besides, it formed a public guarantee for the preservation, integrity, and faithful transmission of the Sacred Book to successive ages.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Gather the people together; </span> not into one place, where all could not hear, but into divers assemblies or synagogues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Women</span> hereby are required to go to Jerusalem at this solemnity, as they were permitted to do in other solemnities, when the males only were enjoined to go, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/23-17.htm" title="Three items in the year all your males shall appear before the LORD God.">Exodus 23:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Children, </span> to wit, such of them as could understand, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm" title="And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.">Nehemiah 8:2</a>,3</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy stranger, </span> i.e. the proselytes, though others also were admitted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they may learn; </span> that they may then certainly and constantly do so, though they had also other opportunities to do so, as upon the sabbath days, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/acts/15-21.htm" title="For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.">Acts 15:21</a></span>, and other solemn feasts, yea, even in their private houses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Gather the people together, men, and women, and children,.... At the three grand festivals in other years, only males were obliged to appear; women might if they would, but they were not bound to it; but at this time all of every age and sex were to be summoned and assembled together; and it is said (z), when the king read in the book of the law, all the people were obliged to come and bring their families, as it is said <a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>; "gather the people", &amp;c. and as it could not be done when it happened on the sabbath day, the reading of the section was put off to the day following: <p>and thy stranger that is within thy gates; not only the proselyte of righteousness, but the proselyte of the gate that renounced idolatry, for his further conviction and thorough conversion to the religion of the true God; or, as the Targum of Jonathan expresses it, that they might see the honour and glory of the law.
