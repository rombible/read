As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If the place ... - Rather, "Because, or since, the place will be too far from thee."

The permission to hunt and use venison for food was doubtless a great boon to the Israelites, not only in the wilderness, but on their settlement in Canaan, as the mountainous ranges of Lebanon, Carmel, and Gilead, on which deer abounded in vast numbers, would thus furnish them with a plentiful and luxuriant repast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As the roebuck and the hart; </span> as common or unhallowed food, though they be of the same kind with the sacrifices which are offered to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike, </span> because there was no holiness in such meat for which the unclean might be excluded from it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten,....
