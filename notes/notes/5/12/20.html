As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>While a stringent injunction is laid down that the old rule (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3</a>, etc.) must be adhered to as regards animals slain in sacrifice, yet permission is now given to slaughter at home what was necessary for the table.

Practical Corollary to the Law of the One Altar<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Originally among the Semites as among some other races all slaughter of domestic animals was sacramental1[132]: cp. the Heb. and Arab. word ‘for altar, lit. <span class="ital">slaughter-place</span> (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm" title="And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.">Deuteronomy 12:3</a></span>). But if this law was still to prevail when sacrifice was limited to one altar the flesh of these animals could only be enjoyed at it, and the lawful or ‘clean’ enjoyment of flesh became impossible to all who lived out of reach of the altar. Compare the analogy in <a href="/hosea/9-3.htm" title="They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.">Hosea 9:3</a> f. where it is said that when Israel are exiled and cease to dwell in Jehovah’s land, where alone sacrifice is legal for them, they must eat <span class="ital">unclean</span> food, and become polluted for their food has not first come <span class="ital">into a house of Jehovah</span> (cp. <a href="/amos/7-17.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; Your wife shall be an harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you shall die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.">Amos 7:17</a>). The confinement of sacrifice to one place therefore rendered it necessary to sanction non-ritual slaughter and eating of animals. This is done in the following verses but on two conditions, (1) that God shall have enlarged Israel’s territory, and (2) that the eaters do not live in the neighbourhood of the altar. On these conditions the eating of domestic animals shall be as that of game, in need of no ritual sanction (<span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/12-22.htm" title="Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so you shall eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.">Deuteronomy 12:22</a></span>). Only their blood must be poured on the ground (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-23.htm" title="Only be sure that you eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and you may not eat the life with the flesh....">Deuteronomy 12:23-25</a></span>). And all <span class="ital">holy things</span>, specially consecrated, must be brought to the one altar, and the <span class="ital">‘olôth</span> and the blood of the <span class="ital">zebaḥim</span> put upon it (<span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/12-26.htm" title="Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:">Deuteronomy 12:26</a></span> f.). The section closes with a general injunction of obedience (<span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/12-28.htm" title="Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you for ever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 12:28</a></span>).—There appears no reason to doubt the unity of this supplement to the law of the one sanctuary (apart from small, possibly editorial, insertions). It is throughout in the Sg. address, and logical in its arrangement. The return to the keynote of the law is natural. Note the religious advance which it involves. By separating the enjoyment of animal food from religious rites (as well as by directing the blood of the animals to be poured on the ground), the law cut off the ancient primitive superstitions of the physical kinship of a tribe and their god with their animals, and rendered less possible the animal idolatry which these engendered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[132] For the argument that this practice was due to belief in the kinship of the tribe (and its god) with its animals and that in consequence these were too sacred to be slain except with solemn rites and in the presence and with the consent of the whole family, clan or tribe, who all partook of the flesh and set apart certain portions and the blood for their god, see W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span> Lects. viii., ix.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/12-20.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, whatever your soul lusts after."><span class="bld">Deuteronomy 12:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">shall enlarge thy border</span>] So <a href="/deuteronomy/19-8.htm" title="And if the LORD your God enlarge your coast, as he has sworn to your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers;">Deuteronomy 19:8</a>, also <a href="/exodus/34-24.htm" title="For I will cast out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither shall any man desire your land, when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God thrice in the year.">Exodus 34:24</a>, probably editorial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as he hath promised thee</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">has said</span>. To regard this as an editorial addition, on the ground that it anticipates 21 <span class="ital">b</span> (Steuern., Berth.), is precarious. The spirit of such a promise is in several previous passages: e.g. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-21.htm" title="Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said to you; fear not, neither be discouraged.">Deuteronomy 1:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy soul desireth</span>] On the soul as seat of the appetite see <a href="/deuteronomy/14-26.htm" title="And you shall bestow that money for whatever your soul lusts after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul desires: and you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you, and your household,">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-15.htm" title="At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to the LORD, and it be sin to you.">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-9.htm" title="Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loves:">Genesis 27:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-7.htm" title="The full soul loathes an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.">Proverbs 27:7</a>. The frankness of this statement is noteworthy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after all the</span> (or <span class="bld">every</span>) <span class="ital">desire of thy soul</span>] The utmost freedom is granted. But the whole passage implies that flesh was eaten only seldom in early Israel, which is confirmed by Nathan’s parable and the Book of Ruth (W. R.

The two names occurring together here, <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.">Deuteronomy 12:15</a></span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/14-5.htm" title="The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.">Deuteronomy 14:5</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/15-22.htm" title="You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.">Deuteronomy 15:22</a>, are not to be taken specifically, but generally of many kinds of gazelle, antelope and deer eaten by Israel and the Arabs, but not allowed for sacrifice (except in certain cases among the Arabs, Wellh. <span class="ital">Reste d. Arab. Heid.</span> 112). The reason was that wild animals taken in hunting were not akin to man, and therefore needed not to be eaten sacramentally. Hence the following clause—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unclean and clean shall eat thereof alike</span>] Both adj., used also in physical and ethical sense, here mean ritually unclean and clean: the injunction is found elsewhere in D, <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/12-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.">Deuteronomy 12:15</a></span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/15-22.htm" title="You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.">Deuteronomy 15:22</a>, and in P.

What freedom the deuteronomic law thus effected, in contrast to petty and embarrassing scrupulousness engendered by the legislation of P and its elaboration in later Judaism, can be appreciated only by a study of the N.T. texts on the question of meats.

P (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm" title="But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not eat.">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-14.htm" title="For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said to the children of Israel, You shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whoever eats it shall be cut off.">Leviticus 17:14</a>), in which, however, the belief was strengthened by the stress that P lays on the expiatory value of sacrifice. Other Semitic peoples shared the same belief. ‘In all Arabian sacrifices, except the holocaust … the godward side of the ritual is summed up in the shedding of the victim’s blood, so that it flows over the sacred symbol, or gathers in a pit (<span class="ital">ghabghab</span>) at the foot of the altar idol.… What enters the pit is held to be conveyed to the deity’ (W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span> 321). The same authority points out that the practice existed also in some Syrian sanctuaries. That it was still older than the Semites is proved by Mr R. A. S. Macalister’s discovery of the neolithic sanctuary at Gezer. Note, however, that D (unlike P) sets no atoning value on the shedding of the blood or life, nor any ritual significance on the slaughter of animals apart from the one altar, but simply states—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/12-24.htm" title="You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth as water."><span class="bld">Deuteronomy 12:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water</span>] It shall have no other significance than that!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-26.htm" title="Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:..."><span class="bld">Deuteronomy 12:26-27</a></span>.

"The choice of your vows," equivalent to your chosen vows, inasmuch as every vow was something special, as the standing phrase &#1504;&#1491;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>, <a href="/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8</a>) distinctly shows. - "Rejoicing before the Lord," which is the phrase applied in <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a> to the celebration of the feast of Tabernacles, was to be the distinctive feature of all the sacrificial meals held by the people at the sanctuary, as is repeatedly affirmed (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-11.htm">Deuteronomy 26:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>). This holy joy in the participation of the blessing bestowed by the Lord was to be shared not only by sons and daughters, but also by salve (men-servants and maid-servants), that they too might taste the friendliness of their God, and also by "the Levite that is in your gates" (i.e., your towns and hamlets; see at <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>). This frequently recurring description of the Levites (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-6.htm">Deuteronomy 18:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>) does not assume that they were homeless, which would be at variance with the allotment of towns for them to dwell in (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>); but simply implies what is frequently added in explanation, that the Levites had "no part nor inheritance," no share of the land as their hereditary property, and in this respect resembled strangers (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, etc.).<p>(Note: The explanation given by De Wette, and adopted by Riehm, of the expression, "the Levite that is within thy gates," is perfectly arbitrary and unfounded: viz., that "the Levites did not live any longer in the towns assigned them by the earlier laws, but were scattered about in the different towns of the other tribes.")<p>And the repeated injunction to invite the Levites to the sacrificial meals is not at variance with <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, where the tithes are assigned to the tribe of Levi for their maintenance. For however ample this revenue may have been according to the law, it was so entirely dependent, upon the honesty and conscientiousness of the people, that the Levites might very easily be brought into a straitened condition, if indifference towards the Lord and His servants should prevail throughout the nation. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>, Moses concludes by once more summing up these instructions in the admonition to beware of offering sacrifices in every place that they might choose, the burnt-offering, as the leading sacrifice, being mentioned instar omnium. </body></html>
