As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If the place ... - Rather, "Because, or since, the place will be too far from thee."

Their Egyptian education had early impressed that bugbear notion of a set of local deities, who expected their dues of all who came to inhabit the country which they honored with their protection, and severely resented the neglect of payment in all newcomers [Warburton]. Taking into consideration the prevalence of this idea among them, we see that against an Egyptian influence was directed the full force of the wholesome caution with which this chapter closes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whither thou goest to possess them; of which phrase see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/9-1.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: You are to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,">Deu 9:1</a> 11:23</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee,....

For unless this short passage be merely one of the many exhortations, which, like a chorus, break in upon both the narratives and the laws of D, it is meant as an introduction to the laws against seducers to idolatry, which follow in ch. 13. Yet, as such, it is abrupt and incomplete; <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm" title="You shall not do so to the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.">Deuteronomy 12:31</a></span> warns against <span class="ital">every abomination to Jehovah</span>, and then, instead of a list of those abominations, gives only one.

That the Semites (as well as other ancient races) sacrificed children has been amply proved. Mesha of Moab, hard pressed by Israel, slew his first-born to Kemosh (<a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.">2 Kings 3:27</a>) just as we know, through the Greeks (Diod. Sic. xx. 14, Porph. <span class="ital">apud</span> Euseb. <span class="ital">Praep. Evang</span>. iv. (64, 4), was the practice of Phoenicians and Carthaginians in times of national danger or disaster. On human sacrifices among them, the Syrians, and ancient Arabs see notes to pp. 346 ff. of W. R. Smith’s <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span> For the Canaanites the evidence of the sacrifice of children by slaughter and burning is conclusive, both from the O.T. texts, and recent discoveries:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>At Gezer round the feet of the <span class="ital">maṣṣeboth</span> (see on <a href="/deuteronomy/16-22.htm" title="Neither shall you set you up any image; which the LORD your God hates.">Deuteronomy 16:22</a>) and ‘over the whole area of the High Place the earth was discovered to be a regular cemetery in which the skeletons of young infants were buried. These infants were never more than a week old. Two at least showed marks of fire.’ They were buried in jars, each with a lamp and a bowl, as if symbols of fire and blood (R. A. S. Macalister, <span class="ital">PEFQ</span>, 1903, <span class="ital">Bible Side Lights etc</span>., 73 f.). At Ta‘anak Sellin found jars with the remains of 20 infants, some up to 5 years of age close to a rock altar (<span class="ital">Tell Ta‘annek</span>, 35 ff.). At Megiddo (Tell el-Mutesellim) under the corner of a temple four jars with remains of infants were dug up from a stratum probably of the late Israelite period. Others have been found under the walls of houses, but whether these were of still-born infants or of such as died naturally is not known; in Egypt, as the present writer has been informed by the American missionaries, the still-born children of Copts are buried in the house (whether with the hope that they may be re-born into it?). See further Frazer, <span class="ital">Adonis, Attis</span> etc. 78. But there can be no doubt of the fate of those found in the sanctuaries; the marks of fire on some and the presence of lamps and bowls prove slaughter and sacrifice by fire. So too the vb. <span class="ital">burn</span> used here and in <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>, as well as the story of Abraham and Isaac, indicates a full sacrifice, slaughter and at least partial consumption by fire on an altar. On this <a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm" title="That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?">Ezekiel 16:21</a> (cp. <a href="/ezekiel/23-39.htm" title="For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, see, thus have they done in the middle of my house.">Ezekiel 23:39</a>) is explicit: <span class="ital">thou hast slain my children and didst deliver them up in causing them to pass through</span> (sc. the fire) <span class="ital">to them</span>. The fire was the means of their conveyance to the deity. Therefore the expression <span class="ital">to make son or daughter pass through the fire</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm" title="There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>) cannot he explained as merely a consecration or ordeal by fire. The data do not enable us to determine whether at any time the practice of devoting the firstborn was binding and universal among the Canaanites, or was confined to periods of calamity. That even among the Canaanites there was a revolt from it is proved by Mr Macalister’s discovery (<span class="ital">op. cit.</span> 170 f., <span class="ital">PEFQ</span>, 1903, 8 f.), in some strata of the pre-Israelite period, of lamps and bowls buried with the jars instead of children and as if in substitution for these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The practice by Israel of sacrificing children after the same fashion and from the same motives is proved by the narratives and laws of the Old Testament as well as by the prophets:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The story, which is found in E, Genesis 22, that the divine word bade Abraham sacrifice Isaac and then revealed a substitute in the ram, is evidence that at one time among the Hebrews the belief had prevailed in the duty of fathers to slay their children, if required, us proof of their fidelity to their God, but that by His mercy a substitute was allowed. This is confirmed by the form of the law in J, <a href="/exodus/13-12.htm" title="That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the matrix, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.">Exodus 13:12</a>. Though this sanctions the redemption of the firstborn son by an animal, the way in which it opens—<span class="ital">thou shalt cause to pass over unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb and every firstling which thou hast that Cometh of a beast</span>—indicates that the original principle, on which Israel acted, was that the firstborn of men, equally with those of animals, were due to the deity by sacrifice. In Judah in the 7th century the popular belief was that Jehovah Himself had given a law obliging the burning of children, for Jeremiah (or a deuteronomic writer whose words have been here placed among his prophecies) emphatically denies the existence of such a law: <span class="ital">which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind</span> (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>). On the other hand Ezekiel supports the opinion that Israel’s God had given such a law and explains that this was in order to punish the second generation in the wilderness. 20:25: <span class="ital">moreover I gave them also statutes not good and judgements whereby they should not live, and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through</span> (sc. the fire) <span class="ital">all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate</span> (see A. B. Davidson’s note on this passage in <span class="ital">Ezekiel</span> in this series).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There was therefore a memory in Israel that the fathers of the race had shared the general Semitic conscience that the sacrifice of children was sanctioned or even expressly commanded by God, but that from an early time He had permitted the substitution of an animal, which permission, J tells us, was expressly dictated by Moses at the Exodus. In the early centuries after the settlement there are no instances of child-sacrifice in Israel except in the story of Jephthah (and more doubtfully in that of Hiel, the re-builder of Jericho). And the cases which recur later are all explicable by the bad influence of the neighbouring heathen, and the panic produced by national disaster, either actual or threatened. So in the case of Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-4.htm" title="And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.">2 Kings 16:4</a>), the historical character of which there is no reason to doubt (see as against Moore, <span class="ital">E.B.</span> art. ‘Molech’ the present writer’s <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, ii. 127, 264); and so with the recrudescence of the practice in the 7th century under Manasseh, and the use of the horrible Topheth or Tephath in the valley of Hinnom (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; ‘Mi.’ <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm" title="And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in your heart:">Deuteronomy 6:6</a> f.; <a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm" title="That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?">Ezekiel 16:21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-18.htm" title="But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:">Ezekiel 20:18</a> ff; <a href="/ezekiel/23-39.htm" title="For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, see, thus have they done in the middle of my house.">Ezekiel 23:39</a>). The present Hebrew text of Jer. says that these sacrifices were offered to ‘Molech,’ but ‘there are grounds for believing that this was a divine title, Melek or King, rather than a name; and that the awful despot who demanded such a propitiation was regarded by the Jews as none other than their own God’ (<span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, ii. 264). This is clear, as we have seen above, from the passages in Jeremiah and Ezekiel. And the reason is plain why D, a work of the 7th century, should alone of all Israel’s law-books be ardent, equally with the great prophets of the time, in repudiating child-sacrifice.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - Here the speaker reverts to the admonition with which he began this part of his address (ver. 2); and warns the people against having any intercourse with the Canaanites in their idolatrous practices. <span class="cmt_word">That thou enquire not after their gods.</span> It was a general belief among the heathen that to ignore or neglect the deities of a country was sure to bring calamity (cf. <a href="/2_kings/17-26.htm">2 Kings 17:26</a>); hence the need of cautioning the Israelites against <span class="accented">inquiring</span> after the gods of the Canaanites when they should be settled in their land, <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The law relating to the blood, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>. - "Be strong not to eat the blood," i.e., stedfastly resist the temptation to eat it. </body></html>
