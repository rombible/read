He sets the law before them, as the rule they were to work by, the way they were to walk in. He sets it before them, as the glass in which they were to see their natural face, that, looking into this perfect law of liberty, they might continue therein. These are the laws, given when Israel was newly come out of Egypt; and they were now repeated. Moses gave these laws in charge, while they encamped over against Beth-peor, an idol place of the Moabites. Their present triumphs were a powerful argument for obedience. And we should understand our own situation as sinners, and the nature of that gracious covenant to which we are invited. Therein greater things are shown to us than ever Israel saw from mount Sinai; greater mercies are given to us than they experienced in the wilderness, or in Canaan. One speaks to us, who is of infinitely greater dignity than Moses; who bare our sins upon the cross; and pleads with us by His dying love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sion must not be confounded with Zion (compare <a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46. Beth-peor&#8212;that is, "house" or "temple of Peor." It is probable that a temple of this Moabite idol stood in full view of the Hebrew camp, while Moses was urging the exclusive claims of God to their worship, and this allusion would be very significant if it were the temple where so many of the Israelites had grievously offended.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon,....

The assertion that this section neither stood after Num, nor really belongs there, has a little foundation as the statement that its contents are at variance with the precepts in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19.htm">Deuteronomy 19</a>. "Toward the sunrising" is introduced as a more precise definition; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, like &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1495;&#1492; in <a href="/numbers/32-19.htm">Numbers 32:19</a> and <a href="/numbers/34-15.htm">Numbers 34:15</a>. On the contents of <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>, comp. <a href="/numbers/35-15.htm">Numbers 35:15</a>. The three towns that were set apart were Bezer, Ramoth, and Golan. "Bezer in the steppe, (namely) in the land of the level" (The Amoritish table-land: <a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>). The situation of this Levitical town and city of refuge, which is only mentioned again in <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-36.htm">Joshua 21:36</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-63.htm">1 Chronicles 6:63</a>, has not yet been discovered. Bezer was probably the same as Bosor (1 Macc. 5:36), and is possibly to be seen in the Berza mentioned by Robinson (Pal. App. p. 170). Ramoth in Gilead, i.e., Ramoth-Mizpeh (comp. <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a> with <a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), was situated, according to the Onom., fifteen Roman miles, or six hours, to the west of Philadelphia (Rabbath-Ammon); probably, therefore, on the site of the modern Salt, which is six hours' journey from Ammn (cf. v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 265, 266). - Golan, in Bashan, according to Eusebius (s. v. Gaulon or Golan), was still a very large village in Batanaea even in his day, from which the district generally received the name of Gaulonitis or Joan; but it has not yet been discovered again. </body></html>
