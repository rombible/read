Did we consider what a God he is with whom we have to do, we should surely make conscience of our duty to him, and not dare to sin against him. Shall we forsake a merciful God, who will never forsake us, if we are faithful unto him? Whither can we go? Let us be held to our duty by the bonds of love, and prevailed with by the mercies of God to cleave to him. Moses urged God's authority over them, and their obligations to him. In keeping God's commandments they would act wisely for themselves. The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. Those who enjoy the benefit of Divine light and laws, ought to support their character for wisdom and honour, that God may be glorified thereby. Those who call upon God, shall certainly find him within call, ready to give an answer of peace to every prayer of faith. All these statutes and judgments of the Divine law are just and righteous, above the statutes and judgments of any of the nations. What they saw at mount Sinai, gave an earnest of the day of judgment, in which the Lord Jesus shall be revealed in flaming fire. They must also remember what they heard at mount Sinai. God manifests himself in the works of the creation, without speech or language, yet their voice is heard, Ps 19:1,3; but to Israel he made himself known by speech and language, condescending to their weakness. The rise of this nation was quite different from the origin of all other nations. See the reasons of free grace; we are not beloved for our own sakes, but for Christ's sake. Moses urged the certain benefit and advantage of obedience. This argument he had begun with, ver. 1, That ye may live, and go in and possess the land; and this he concludes with, ver. 40, That it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee. He reminds them that their prosperity would depend upon their piety. Apostacy from God would undoubtedly be the ruin of their nation. He foresees their revolt from God to idols. Those, and those only, shall find God to their comfort, who seek him with all their heart. Afflictions engage and quicken us to seek God; and, by the grace of God working with them, many are thus brought back to their right mind. When these things are come upon thee, turn to the Lord thy God, for thou seest what comes of turning from him. Let all the arguments be laid together, and then say, if religion has not reason on its side. None cast off the government of their God, but those who first abandon the understanding of a man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He chose their seed after them - literally, "his seed after him."

This closing thought in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-32.htm">Deuteronomy 4:32</a> is connected by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (for) with the leading idea in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-31.htm">Deuteronomy 4:31</a>. "Jehovah thy God is a merciful God," to show that the sole ground for the election and redemption of Israel was the compassion of God towards the human race. "For ask now of the days that are past, from the day that God created man upon the earth, and from one end of the heaven unto the other, whether so great a thing has ever happened, or anything of the kind has been heard of:" i.e., the history of all times since the creation of man, and of all places under the whole heaven, can relate no such events as those which have happened to Israel, viz., at Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-33.htm">Deuteronomy 4:33</a>; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-12.htm">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). From this awfully glorious manifestation of God, Moses goes back in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a> to the miracles with which God effected the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt. "Or has a god attempted (made the attempt) to come and take to himself people from people (i.e., to fetch the people of Israel out of the midst of the Egyptian nation), with temptations (the events in Egypt by which Pharaoh's relation to the Lord was put to the test; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-18.htm">Deuteronomy 7:18-19</a>), with signs and wonders (the Egyptian plagues, see <a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>), and with conflict (at the Red Sea: <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>), and with a strong hand and outstretched arm (see <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>), and with great terrors?" In the three points mentioned last, all the acts of God in Egypt are comprehended, according to both cause and effect. They were revelations of the omnipotence of the Lord, and produced great terrors (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30-36</a>). </body></html>
