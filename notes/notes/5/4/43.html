He sets the law before them, as the rule they were to work by, the way they were to walk in. He sets it before them, as the glass in which they were to see their natural face, that, looking into this perfect law of liberty, they might continue therein. These are the laws, given when Israel was newly come out of Egypt; and they were now repeated. Moses gave these laws in charge, while they encamped over against Beth-peor, an idol place of the Moabites. Their present triumphs were a powerful argument for obedience. And we should understand our own situation as sinners, and the nature of that gracious covenant to which we are invited. Therein greater things are shown to us than ever Israel saw from mount Sinai; greater mercies are given to us than they experienced in the wilderness, or in Canaan. One speaks to us, who is of infinitely greater dignity than Moses; who bare our sins upon the cross; and pleads with us by His dying love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the plain country - literally, "in the land of the Mishor."

In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>, it is added "upon the plain"; this perhaps was the wilderness of Moab, in the plains of it, the same with Bozrah, see <a href="/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a> and in the Apocrypha:"Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire,'' (1 Maccabees 5:28)it was in the <p>plain country of the Reubenites, or lay in that part of the country which was allotted to them, and which they gave to the Levites, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-78.htm">1 Chronicles 6:78</a>, <p>and Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites; it lay in that part of Mount Gilead, and among the cities of it, which fell to the share of the tribe of Gad, and was by them given to the Levites, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-80.htm">1 Chronicles 6:80</a>, this city is frequently in Scripture called Ramothgilead; see <a href="/1_kings/4-13.htm">1 Kings 4:13</a>. <p>and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites, or "Gaulon", as the Septuagint, and from hence the country round about was called Gaulanitis; all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, was given to the half tribe of Manasseh, and out of it this city was given by them to the Levites, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-71.htm">1 Chronicles 6:71</a>, and appointed a city of refuge: now as these cities were typical of Christ, there may be something observed in the names of them as agreeing with him. "Bezer" signifies "a fortified place"; Christ is the fortress, mountain, and place of defence for his people, and strong hold to which the prisoners of hope turn, the strong tower whither the righteous run and are safe. "Ramoth" signifies "exaltations"; which may point both at the exaltation of Christ in human nature at the right hand of God, and the exaltation of his people by him, who are raised by him from a low estate to sit among princes, and to inherit the throne of glory, and by whom he is exalted in his person, office, and grace. "Golan" signifies "revealed" or" manifested": so Christ has been manifest in the flesh, and is revealed to sinners, when they are called by his grace; to whom they flee for refuge, and lay hold on him, the hope set before them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">43</span>. <span class="ital">Bezer</span>] <span class="bld">Beṣer</span>; described, as here, in <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm" title="And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness on the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.">Joshua 20:8</a>; and in <a href="/joshua/21-36.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:36</a> along with Yahaṣ, Ḳedemoth, and Mepha‘ath.

Both forms of construction are forced and unnatural. The verses form an independent thought; and the most important point, which was to bind Israel to faithfulness towards Jehovah, is given as the sum and substance of the whole address, and placed as a protasis at the head of the period. The only thing that admits of dispute, is whether the apodosis commences with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; ("He chose," <a href="/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>), or only with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1498; ("brought thee out"). Either is possible; and it makes no difference, so far as the main thought is concerned, whether we regard the choice of Israel, or simply the deliverance from Egypt, in which that choice was carried into practical effect, as the consequence of the love of Jehovah to the patriarchs. - The copula &#1493; before &#1514;&#1492;&#1514; is specially emphatic, "and truly," and indicates that the sum and substance of the whole discourse is about to follow, or the one thought in which the whole appeal culminates. It was the love of God to the fathers, not the righteousness of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-5.htm">Deuteronomy 9:5</a>), which lay at the foundation of the election of their posterity to be the nation of Jehovah's possession, and also of all the miracles of grace which were performed in connection with their deliverance out of Egypt. Moses returns to this thought again at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>, for the purpose of impressing it upon the minds of the people as the one motive which laid them under the strongest obligation to circumcise the foreskin of their heart, and walk in the fear and love of the Lord their God (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>.). - The singular suffixes in &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; (his seed) and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; after him) refer to Abraham, whom Moses had especially in his mind when speaking of "thy fathers," because he was pre-eminently the lover of God (<a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>), and also the beloved or friend of God (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>.). "By His face" points back to <a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>. The face of Jehovah was Jehovah in His personal presence, in His won person, who brought Israel out of Egypt, to root out great and mighty nations before it, and give it their land for an inheritance. "As this day" (clearly shows), viz., by the destruction of Sihon and Og, which gave to the Israelites a practical pledge that the Canaanites in like manner would be rooted out before them. The expression "as this day" does not imply, therefore, that the Canaanites were already rooted out from their land. </body></html>
