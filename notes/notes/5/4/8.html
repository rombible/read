What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion.

The former, their national advantages, are described (De 4:7, 8), and they were twofold: 1. God's readiness to hear and aid them at all times; and 2. the excellence of that religion in which they were instructed, set forth in the "statutes and judgments so righteous" which the law of Moses contained. Their duty corresponding to these pre-eminent advantages as a people, was also twofold: 1. their own faithful obedience to that law; and 2. their obligation to imbue the minds of the young and rising generation with similar sentiments of reverence and respect for it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whereby he implies that the true greatness of a nation doth not consist in pomp or power, or largeness of empire, as commonly men think, but in the righteousness of its laws. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous,....

Now there was not any nation then in being, nor any since, to be compared with the nation of the Jews, for the wise and wholesome laws given unto them; no, not the more cultivated and civilized nations, as the Grecians and Romans, who had the advantage of such wise lawgivers as they were accounted, as Solon, Lycurgus, Numa, and others; and indeed the best laws that they had seem to be borrowed from the Jews. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">And what great nation … hath statutes … so righteous</span>] This challenge is as just as the preceding. Other great codes and systems of ethics there undoubtedly were in Israel’s world (e.g. the Code of Ḫammurabi and various systems in Egypt). But the deuteronomic Torah is rightly exalted above them—because of its pure religious fervency, its revelation of the Divine character, and its enforcement, in the details of human conduct, of the example of God Himself. Moreover, the Law of no other nation in Israel’s world has exerted so practical an influence on the ethics of mankind. How necessary it was to impress Israel, both immediately before and during the Exile, with the distinction which the Law gave them among the nations is seen from such passages as <a href="/ezekiel/20-32.htm" title="And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.">Ezekiel 20:32</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-8.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like to all the heathen;">Ezekiel 25:8</a>. The heathen said Israel is <span class="ital">like all the nations</span>, and Israelites were tempted to fall back upon the easier ethics of their neighbours, <span class="ital">we will be as the heathen</span>. This is the temptation of all recipients of high ideals and duties; none are more exposed to it than Christians; they must remind themselves, as this discourse insists, of the privilege and responsibility of those who having known the better dare not be content with the easier. The substance of these verses then is, <span class="ital">Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye have been called</span>. The abuse of such a conscience is the self-righteousness born of a merely formal fulfilment of the Law (<a href="/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>). ‘Pharisaism and Deuteronomy came into the world the same day’ (A.

Not by omissions only, but by additions also, was the commandment weakened, and the word of God turned into ordinances of men, as Pharisaism sufficiently proved. This precept is repeated in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>; it is then revived by the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-6.htm">Proverbs 30:6</a>), and enforced again at the close of the whole revelation (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18-19</a>). In the same sense Christ also said that He had not come to destroy the law or the prophets, but to fulfil (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>); and the old covenant was not abrogated, but only glorified and perfected, by the new.</body></html>
