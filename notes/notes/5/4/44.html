He sets the law before them, as the rule they were to work by, the way they were to walk in. He sets it before them, as the glass in which they were to see their natural face, that, looking into this perfect law of liberty, they might continue therein. These are the laws, given when Israel was newly come out of Egypt; and they were now repeated. Moses gave these laws in charge, while they encamped over against Beth-peor, an idol place of the Moabites. Their present triumphs were a powerful argument for obedience. And we should understand our own situation as sinners, and the nature of that gracious covenant to which we are invited. Therein greater things are shown to us than ever Israel saw from mount Sinai; greater mercies are given to us than they experienced in the wilderness, or in Canaan. One speaks to us, who is of infinitely greater dignity than Moses; who bare our sins upon the cross; and pleads with us by His dying love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses would be more properly assigned to the next chapter.

Introduction (or Introductions) to the following Discourses and Laws (5–26)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The appearance of a fresh heading at this point—between the two distinct sets of discourses <a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm" title="The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:">Deuteronomy 1:6</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm" title="You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.">Deuteronomy 4:40</a> and Deuteronomy 5-11, which are further separated by the historical fragment, <a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-41.htm" title="Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;...">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a>—raises questions at the heart of the problem of the structure of the book of Deuteronomy. Does it signify that once the book began here and consisted only of the discourses 5–11 and the laws 12–26; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm" title="The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:">Deuteronomy 1:6</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm" title="You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.">Deuteronomy 4:40</a> having been prefixed later? So Graf, Kue., Wellh., König, etc. Or is the appearance of the heading just here compatible with the theory that the whole of 1–26 is the work of one author? So Dillm. and Driver on the ground that a new title would not be unnatural where the actual exposition of the law at last begins (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm" title="The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:">Deuteronomy 1:6</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm" title="You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.">Deuteronomy 4:40</a> having been mainly historical). Other alternatives arise from the structure of the heading. Like that in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....">Deuteronomy 1:1-5</a> it is apparently composite. <span class="ital"><a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:...">Deuteronomy 4:44-45</a></span> seem two independent titles; <span class="ital"><a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-46.htm" title="On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelled at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:...">Deuteronomy 4:46-49</a></span> not only accumulate details after the manner of some other titles in the O.T. but contain a slight difference of style: in 47 D’s <span class="ital">towards the sunrising</span>, but in 49 P’s shorter form of the same (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/4-41.htm" title="Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;">Deuteronomy 4:41</a></span> and the notes below). Other non-deuteronomic phrases are <span class="ital">set before</span> and <span class="ital">children of Israel</span>, thrice (see below on <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a></span>); but both the contents, and with one exception the language, of 46–49 closely recall parts of chs. 2 and 3. Recently there has been a general disposition to break up the heading. Steuernagel supposes 44 and 45 to be respectively the titles of the two documents, in the Sg. and in the Pl. form of address, which he traces throughout chs. 5 ff.; Bertholet takes 44 as the transition from the first introductory address, 1–3, to the legislation proper, 12–26; and 45–49 as an introduction to ch. 5; Cullen takes 44 with 45<span class="ital">c</span>, 46<span class="ital">a</span> as the title to the original environment of the Law code or ‘Torah,’ but 45<span class="ital">ab</span>, 46<span class="ital">bc</span> as that of the first combined edition of the ‘Miṣwah’ and ‘Torah’ (see Introd. § 1). The variety of these hypotheses alone shows their precariousness; and there is this further objection to finding in the double title, 44 and 45, headings to the original documents of D, viz. that even in these verses non-deuteronomic phrases occur. The <span class="ital">whole</span> passage looks editorial: one piece (Dillmann) in the cumulative style beloved by later scribes rather than a growth from an original nucleus (Driver). Why then was it inserted just here? Dillm.’s and Driver’s answer, because at last with ch. 5 begins the actual exposition of the law, is hardly relevant; because in that case <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a></span> or <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/4-45.htm" title="These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 4:45</a></span> would have contained some such verb as the <span class="ital">expound</span> which we find in the title <a href="/deuteronomy/1-5.htm" title="On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>. Indeed, that title is more suitable here than where it stands, for it describes better the expository and hortatory character of 5 ff. than the prevailing historical style of <a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm" title="The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:">Deuteronomy 1:6</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm" title="You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>.—On a review of the data and these arguments it seems to the present writer more possible, and even probable, that part of <a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab....">Deuteronomy 1:1-5</a> (and more particularly 5) originally formed the introduction to the combined discourses and laws, 5–26; that it was divorced from these by the prefixing to them of <a href="/deuteronomy/1-6.htm" title="The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:">Deuteronomy 1:6</a> to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm" title="You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days on the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; and that when the whole book 1–26 was thus constituted, it was found convenient for its practical use to supply a new heading to chs. 5 ff.

Both forms of construction are forced and unnatural. The verses form an independent thought; and the most important point, which was to bind Israel to faithfulness towards Jehovah, is given as the sum and substance of the whole address, and placed as a protasis at the head of the period. The only thing that admits of dispute, is whether the apodosis commences with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; ("He chose," <a href="/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>), or only with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1498; ("brought thee out"). Either is possible; and it makes no difference, so far as the main thought is concerned, whether we regard the choice of Israel, or simply the deliverance from Egypt, in which that choice was carried into practical effect, as the consequence of the love of Jehovah to the patriarchs. - The copula &#1493; before &#1514;&#1492;&#1514; is specially emphatic, "and truly," and indicates that the sum and substance of the whole discourse is about to follow, or the one thought in which the whole appeal culminates. It was the love of God to the fathers, not the righteousness of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-5.htm">Deuteronomy 9:5</a>), which lay at the foundation of the election of their posterity to be the nation of Jehovah's possession, and also of all the miracles of grace which were performed in connection with their deliverance out of Egypt. Moses returns to this thought again at <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>, for the purpose of impressing it upon the minds of the people as the one motive which laid them under the strongest obligation to circumcise the foreskin of their heart, and walk in the fear and love of the Lord their God (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>.). - The singular suffixes in &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; (his seed) and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; after him) refer to Abraham, whom Moses had especially in his mind when speaking of "thy fathers," because he was pre-eminently the lover of God (<a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>), and also the beloved or friend of God (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>.). "By His face" points back to <a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>. The face of Jehovah was Jehovah in His personal presence, in His won person, who brought Israel out of Egypt, to root out great and mighty nations before it, and give it their land for an inheritance. "As this day" (clearly shows), viz., by the destruction of Sihon and Og, which gave to the Israelites a practical pledge that the Canaanites in like manner would be rooted out before them. The expression "as this day" does not imply, therefore, that the Canaanites were already rooted out from their land. </body></html>
