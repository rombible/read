Whence it follows, that this promise was not fulfilled either in Joshua or Samuel, and the best of the Jews confess, that it should not be fulfilled till the Messiah came. From these words it plainly appears that this chapter, at least this verse, could not have been written till long after Moses’s death, when a great number of prophets had been known in Israel. <span class="ital">Whom the Lord knew face to face — </span>Whom God did so freely and familiarly converse with.

This signifies that the law made nothing perfect, Heb 7:19 It brings men into a wilderness of conviction, but not into the Canaan of rest and settled peace. That honour was reserved for Joshua, our Lord Jesus, of whom Joshua was a type, (and the name is the same,) to do that for us which the law could not do, Ro 8:3. Through him we enter into the spiritual rest of conscience, and eternal rest in heaven. Moses was greater than any other prophet of the Old Testament. But our Lord Jesus went beyond him, far more than the other prophets came short of him. And see a strong resemblance between the redeemer of the children of Israel and the Redeemer of mankind. Moses was sent by God, to deliver the Israelites form a cruel bondage; he led them out, and conquered their enemies. He became not only their deliverer, but their lawgiver; not only their lawgiver, but their judge; and, finally, leads them to the border of the land of promise. Our blessed Saviour came to rescue us out of the slavery of the devil, and to restore us to liberty and happiness. He came to confirm every moral precept of the first lawgiver; and to write them, not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart. He came to be our Judge also, inasmuch as he hath appointed a day when he will judge all the secrets of men, and reward or punish accordingly. This greatness of Christ above Moses, is a reason why Christians should be obedient and faithful to the holy religion by which they profess to be Christ's followers.

The statement in this verse could only have been inserted some time after the death of Moses, and after the people had had manifestations of God's presence with them, both by communications from him through the prophets and by the successes which he had given them over their enemies. But it is not necessary to suppose that a long period during which a lengthened succession of prophets had arisen had elapsed. "<span class="accented">Moses</span> was the founder and mediator of the old covenant. As long as this covenant was to last, no prophet could arise in Israel like unto Moses. There is but One who is worthy of greater honor than Moses, namely, the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, who is placed as a Son over all the house of God, in which Moses was found faithful as a servant (comp. <a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2-6</a> with <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), Jesus Christ, the Founder and Mediator of the new and everlasting covenant" (Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.

From Nebo, a peak of Pisgah, which affords a very extensive prospect on all sides, he saw the land of Gilead, the land to the east of the Jordan as far as Dan, i.e., not Laish-Dan near the central source of the Jordan (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>), which did not belong to Gilead, but a Dan in northern Peraea, which has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>); and the whole of the land on the west of the Jordan, Canaan proper, in all its different districts, namely, "the whole of Naphtali," i.e., the later Galilee on the north, "the land of Ephraim and Manasseh" in the centre, and "the whole of the land of Judah," the southern portion of Canaan, in all its breadth, "to the hinder (Mediterranean) sea" (see <a href="/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>); also "the south land" (Negeb: see at <a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>), the southern land of steppe towards the Arabian desert, and "the valley of the Jordan" (see <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>), i.e., the deep valley from Jericho the palm-city (so called from the palms which grew there, in the valley of the Jordan: <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-15.htm">2 Chronicles 28:15</a>) "to Zoar" at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea (see at <a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>). This sight of every part of the land on the east and west was not an ecstatic vision, but a sight with the bodily eyes, whose natural power of vision was miraculously increased by God, to give Moses a glimpse at least of the glorious land which he was not to tread, and delight his eye with a view of the inheritance intended for his people. </body></html>
