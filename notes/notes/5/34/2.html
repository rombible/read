Moses from Mount Nebo Views the Land.<p>1. Moses went up from the plains of Moab&#8212;This chapter appears from internal evidence to have been written subsequently to the death of Moses, and it probably formed, at one time, an introduction to the Book of Joshua.<p>unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah&#8212;literally, the head or summit of the Pisgah; that is, the height (compare Nu 23:14; De 3:17-27; 4:49). The general name given to the whole mountain range east of Jordan, was Abarim (compare De 32:49), and the peak to which Moses ascended was dedicated to the heathen Nebo, as Balaam's standing place had been consecrated to Peor. Some modern travellers have fixed on Jebel Attarus, a high mountain south of the Jabbok (Zurka), as the Nebo of this passage [Burckhardt, Seetzen, &c.]. But it is situated too far north for a height which, being described as "over against Jericho," must be looked for above the last stage of the Jordan.<p>the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead&#8212;That pastoral region was discernible at the northern extremity of the mountain line on which he stood, till it ended, far beyond his sight in Dan. Westward, there were on the horizon, the distant hills of "all Naphtali." Coming nearer, was "the land of Ephraim and Manasseh." Immediately opposite was "all the land of Judah," a title at first restricted to the portion of this tribe, beyond which were "the utmost sea" (the Mediterranean) and the Desert of the "South." These were the four great marks of the future inheritance of his people, on which the narrative fixes our attention. Immediately below him was "the circle" of the plain of Jericho, with its oasis of palm trees; and far away on his left, the last inhabited spot before the great desert "Zoar." The foreground of the picture alone was clearly discernible. There was no miraculous power of vision imparted to Moses. That he should see all that is described is what any man could do, if he attained sufficient elevation. The atmosphere of the climate is so subtle and free from vapor that the sight is carried to a distance of which the beholder, who judges from the more dense air of Europe, can form no idea [Vere Monro]. But between him and that "good land," the deep valley of the Jordan intervened; "he was not to go over thither."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All Naphtali, </span> i.e. the land of <span class="ital">Naphtali</span>, which, together with Dan, was in the north of Canaan, as Ephraim and Manasseh were in the midland parts, and Judah on the south, and the sea on the west.

Iron and brass be thy castle; and as the days of thy life let thy rest continue." Asher, the prosperous (see at <a href="/genesis/30-15.htm">Genesis 30:15</a>), was justly to bear the name. He was to be a child of prosperity; blessed with earthly good, he was to enjoy rest all his life long in strong fortresses. It is evident enough that this blessing is simply an exposition of the name Asher, and that Moses here promises the tribe a verification of the omen contained in its name. &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; does not mean "blessed with children," or "praised because of his children," in which case we should have &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;; but "blessed before the sons" (cf. <a href="/judges/5-24.htm">Judges 5:24</a>), i.e., blessed before the sons of Jacob, who were peculiarly blessed, equivalent to the most blessed of all the sons of Israel. &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean the beloved among his brethren, acceptable to his brethren, but the one who enjoyed the favour of the Lord, i.e., the one peculiarly favoured by the Lord. Dipping the foot in oil points to a land flowing with oil (<a href="/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>), i.e., fat or fertile throughout, which Jacob had already promised to Asher (see <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>). To complete the prosperity, however, security and rest were required for the enjoyment of the blessings bestowed by God; and these are promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-25.htm">Deuteronomy 33:25</a>. &#1502;&#1504;&#1506;&#1500; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.) does not mean a shoe, but is derived from &#1504;&#1506;&#1500;, to bolt (<a href="/judges/3-23.htm">Judges 3:23</a>), and signifies either a bolt, or that which is shut fast; a poetical expression for a castle or fortress. Asher's dwellings were to be castles, fortresses of iron and brass; i.e., as strong and impregnable as if they were built of iron and brass. The pursuit of mining is not to be thought of as referred to here, even though the territory of Asher, which reached to Lebanon, may have contained brass and iron (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>). Luther follows the lxx and Vulgate, and renders this clause, "iron and brass be upon his shoes;" but this is undoubtedly wrong, as the custom of fastening the shoes or sandals with brass or iron was quite unknown to the Israelites; and even Goliath, who was clothed in brass from head to foot, and wore iron greaves, had no iron sandals, though the military shoes of the ancient Romans had nails in the soles. Moreover, the context contains no reference to war, so as to suggest the idea that the treading down and cursing of the foe are intended. "As thy days," i.e., as long as the days of thy life last, let thy rest be (continue). Luther's rendering, "let thine old age be as thy youth," which follows the Vulgate, cannot be sustained; for although &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;, derived from &#1491;&#1488;&#1489;, to vanish away, certainly might signify old age, the expression "thy days" cannot possibly be understood as signifying youth. </body></html>
