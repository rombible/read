The command, "Take heed by the plague of leprosy to observe diligently and to do according to all that the priests teach thee," etc., does not mean, that when they saw signs of leprosy they were to be upon their guard, to observe everything that the priests directed them, as Knobel and many others suppose. For, in the first place, the reference to the punishment of Miriam with leprosy is by no means appropriate to such a thought as this, since Miriam did not act in opposition to the priests after she had been smitten with leprosy, but brought leprosy upon herself as a punishment, by her rebellion against Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>.). And in the second place, this view cannot be reconciled with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1506; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, since &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; with &#1489;&#1468;, either to be upon one's guard against (before) anything (<a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>), or when taken in connection with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, to beware by the soul, i.e., for the sake of the worth of the soul (<a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>). The thought here, therefore, is, "Be on thy guard because of the plague of leprosy," i.e., that thou dost not get it, have to bear it, as the reward for thy rebellion against what the priests teach according to the commandment of the Lord. "Watch diligently, that thou do not incur the plague of leprosy" (Vulgate); or, "that thou do not sin, so as to be punished with leprosy" (J. H. Michaelis).</body></html>
