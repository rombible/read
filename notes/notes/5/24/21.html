When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field&#8212;The grain, pulled up by the roots or cut down with a sickle, was laid in loose sheaves; the fruit of the olive was obtained by striking the branches with long poles; and the grape clusters, severed by a hook, were gathered in the hands of the vintager. Here is a beneficent provision for the poor. Every forgotten sheaf in the harvest-field was to lie; the olive tree was not to be beaten a second time; nor were grapes to be gathered, in order that, in collecting what remained, the hearts of the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow might be gladdened by the bounty of Providence.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard,....

These laws were made in favour of the poor, that mercy and kindness might be showed to them, and that they might have a taste of all the fruits of the earth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">When thou gatherest</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">cuttest off</span>, the usual vb. for harvesting grapes (<a href="/judges/9-27.htm" title="And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and stepped the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.">Jdg 9:27</a>). <span class="ital">Ingathering</span>, applied to the vintage feast (see on <a href="/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>), is another vb.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not glean it afterward</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Thou shalt not glean after thee</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. after thou hast reaped and gathered for thyself.
