The first and great rule was, to commit their cause to God, depending with entire confidence upon that divine power which had so often and so wonderfully delivered them, without the least fear or discouragement at the superior force or terrible appearance of their enemies. <span class="ital">And seest horses and chariots — </span>The armies of the Israelites consisted wholly of foot, and their law seems to have obliged them to continue so, in order that their reliance might be entirely on God, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>. But the Egyptians, Canaanites, and other nations, had the advantage of horses and chariots, in which they placed their confidence. Thus the psalmist: “Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.” These chariots were sometimes armed with scythes, to rush in among the foot, and cut them down like grass, which made them very formidable. These are the <span class="ital">chariots of iron, </span>mentioned <a href="/judges/4-3.htm" title="And the children of Israel cried to the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.">Jdg 4:3</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-9 In the wars wherein Israel engaged according to the will of God, they might expect the Divine assistance.

The unwillingness might arise from a man's outward condition. God would not be served by men forced against their will. Thy people shall be willing, Ps 110:3. In running the Christian race, and fighting the good fight of faith, we must lay aside all that would make us unwilling. If a man's unwillingness rose from weakness and fear, he had leave to return from the war. The reason here given is, lest his brethren's heart fail as well as his heart.

There were two sorts of war the Israelites were engaged in, one commanded and another permitted, as Maimonides (c) distinguishes; one was by the order and appointment of God, as against the seven nations of Canaan; the other was voluntary and arbitrary, which was left to their own discretion and will, as they saw fit, when they were provoked or distressed, or were invaded by their enemies, or they saw reason to go out against them, and either act the offensive or defensive part, or both; and of each of these some things are said in this chapter: <p>and seest horses and chariots, and a people more than thou; the Israelites had no horses, and so no chariots, their armies were all infantry; but their neighbouring nations that made war with them had a large cavalry, and multitudes of chariots, which made them very formidable; thus Shishak, king of Egypt, in the times of Rehoboam, came against Jerusalem with 1200 chariots and 60,000, horsemen, and people without number; and Zerah the Ethiopian, in the times of Asa, came against him with an host of 100,000 men, and three hundred chariots, <a href="/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2</a>. <p>be not afraid of them; because of the strength of their cavalry, the terrible approaches of their chariots, and the number of their men: <p>for the Lord thy God is with thee; hence, as Hezekiah says, more would be with them than with their enemies, with whom was an arm of flesh, but with them the Lord their God, <a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7</a> and so the Targum of Jonathan,"for all of them shall be reckoned as one horse and one chariot before the Lord your God;''with whom numbers are nothing; and which adds,"for his Word shall be your help;''the eternal Logos, or Word of God; so Onkelos; and if God and his Word, his only begotten Son, are on the side of his people, they have nothing to fear from enemies, though ever so many and mighty: <p>which brought thee out of the land of Egypt; which is observed for the encouragement of their faith and confidence in him; for he that did that for them, what is it he cannot or will not do? <p>(c) Hilchot Melachim, c. 7. sect. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, <i>and</i> a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God <i>is</i> with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span><p>(a) Meaning, upon just occasion: for God does not permit his people to fight every time it seems good to them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">When thou goest forth to</span> <span class="bld">war</span>, etc.] So <a href="/deuteronomy/21-10.htm" title="When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God has delivered them into your hands, and you have taken them captive,">Deuteronomy 21:10</a>, cp. <a href="/deuteronomy/23-9.htm" title="When the host goes forth against your enemies, then keep you from every wicked thing.">Deuteronomy 23:9</a> (10).
