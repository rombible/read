The Lord was to be their only confidence. In these respects they were types of the Christian's warfare. Those unwilling to fight, must be sent away. The unwillingness might arise from a man's outward condition. God would not be served by men forced against their will. Thy people shall be willing, Ps 110:3. In running the Christian race, and fighting the good fight of faith, we must lay aside all that would make us unwilling. If a man's unwillingness rose from weakness and fear, he had leave to return from the war. The reason here given is, lest his brethren's heart fail as well as his heart.

And the officers shall speak unto the people&#8212;literally, Shoterim, who are called "scribes" or "overseers" (Ex 5:6). They might be keepers of the muster-roll, or perhaps rather military heralds, whose duty it was to announce the orders of the generals (2Ch 26:11). This proclamation (De 20:5-8) must have been made previous to the priest's address, as great disorder and inconvenience must have been occasioned if the serried ranks were broken by the departure of those to whom the privilege was granted. Four grounds of exemption are expressly mentioned: (1) The dedication of a new house, which, as in all Oriental countries still, was an important event, and celebrated by festive and religious ceremonies (Ne 12:27); exemption for a year. (2) The planting of a vineyard. The fruit of the first three years being declared unfit for use, and the first-fruits producible on the fourth, the exemption in this case lasted at least four years. (3) The betrothal of a wife, which was always a considerable time before marriage. It was deemed a great hardship to leave a house unfinished, a new property half cultivated, and a recently contracted marriage; and the exemptions allowed in these cases were founded on the principle that a man's heart being deeply engrossed by something at a distance, he would not be very enthusiastic in the public service. (4) The ground of exemption was cowardice. From the composition of the Israelitish army, which was an irregular militia, all above twenty years being liable to serve, many totally unfit for war must have been called to the field; and it was therefore a prudential arrangement to rid the army of such unwarlike elements&#8212;persons who could render no efficient service, and the contagion of whose craven spirit might lead to panic and defeat.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Houses were <span class="ital">dedicated</span> by feasting and thanksgiving to God.

What these officers were is not easy to say; they seem not to be officers of the army, for they are distinguished from captains of the armies, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-9.htm">Deuteronomy 20:9</a>, unless they can be thought to be general officers; but the word for them is the same that is used of such that attended the judges and were ministers to them, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>, and perhaps they were a sort of heralds that published and proclaimed what the anointed of war had said; and so the above writer (h) affirms, that what here follows was first spoken by him, and after that (what is said, <a href="/deuteronomy/20-3.htm">Deuteronomy 20:3</a>) the anointed of war speaks, saying: <p>what man is there,.... (to the end of <a href="/deuteronomy/20-7.htm">Deuteronomy 20:7</a>) thus far the anointed of war speaks, and then an officer causes all the people to hear it with an high voice, saying: <p>what man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? or perfected it, as the Targum of Jonathan, not quite finished it, has not, as that paraphrast says, fixed in it the door posts, or rather perhaps he means the Mezuzah, or writing, which the Jews thought themselves obliged to fasten to the door posts of their houses; see <a href="/deuteronomy/11-20.htm">Deuteronomy 11:20</a> until this was done, an house was not thought to be completed; though Jarchi interprets this of inhabitation; of a man's having built a house, but has not yet dwelt in it; see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, so Josephus (i) explains it, of its not having been used and enjoyed by a man a full year; but there seems to be something more than all this in dedication; for though it does not signify a consecration or dedication of it to holy uses, as the dedication of the tabernacle and temple, yet there was something done, some ceremony used at entrance into a new house; a good man entered into it, no doubt, with prayer and praise, as the thirtieth psalm was composed by David at the dedication of his house; see <a href="/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27</a> and perhaps it was usual to have their friends together, and make a cheerful entertainment on the occasion. Ben Melech on the place, assures us it was a custom to make a feast and merriment at eating the first meal in a new house: <p>let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it; or perfect it, as the above Targum, or dwell in it, as well as have the pleasure of entertaining his friends in it at the first opening of it; this was either a command, enjoining a man, in such a circumstance, to return, and so the rest that follow, or a permission to him, allowing him to do it if he thought fit. <p>(h) Hilchot Melachim, c. 7. sect. 3.((i) Antiqu. l. 4. c. 8. sect. 41. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man <i>is there</i> that hath built a new house, and hath not <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.</span><p>(c) For when they first entered to dwell in a house, they gave thanks to God, acknowledging that they had that benefit by his grace.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">officers</span>] <span class="ital">shoṭerîm</span>, <a href="/deuteronomy/1-15.htm" title="So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm" title="Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a new house … not dedicated</span>] The vb is used of the dedication of the Temple, <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm" title="And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep.

(A.V. of title to Psalms 30 is misleading.) At the present day in Syria, when a house is built a goat or sheep is slain and the blood stamped (often by the open hand) on the door or walls, as the present writer has seen in Moab and elsewhere: cp. Doughty <span class="ital">Ar. Des.</span> i. 136, W. R. Smith <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span> 133 f., Musil, <span class="ital">Moab</span>, 372, <span class="ital">Ethn. Ber.</span> 417. The sacrifice propitiates the spirits of the disturbed soil. To leave for war without fulfilling such rites was regarded as fatal; see Schwally, 91 f., who quotes as parallel <span class="ital">Iliad</span> ii. 698 f.: Protesilaus, the first Greek slain by the Trojans, had left his house unfinished.

It belonged to them to appoint the men who were to serve, and to release those who had been summoned to the war, but whose domestic relations were such as to entitle them to exemption. If there was one who had built a house, but had not dedicated it, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. by taking possession of it and dwelling in it; or if there was one who had planted a vineyard and had not eaten of the fruit thereof; or if there was one who had betrothed a wife, but had not yet married her; - such were to be allowed to return home, lest they should die in battle, and it be left to others to consummate what they had begun. According to Josephus, this exemption was for a year, according to the analogy of <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Dedicated</span>; probably formal possession was taken of the house by some solemn ceremony, followed by a festive entertainment. <span class="cmt_word">Vineyard</span>.
