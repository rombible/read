Careful, observe to do; 2. Universal, to do all the commandments; and 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God as the Lord, and their God, and with a holy fear of him. To engage them to this obedience. Moses directs them to look back. It is good to remember all the ways, both of God's providence and grace, by which he has led us through this wilderness, that we may cheerfully serve him and trust in him. They must remember the straits they were sometimes brought into, for mortifying their pride, and manifesting their perverseness; to prove them, that they and others might know all that was in their heart, and that all might see that God chose them, not for any thing in them which might recommend them to his favour. They must remember the miraculous supplies of food and raiment granted them. Let none of God's children distrust their Father, nor take any sinful course for the supply of their necessities. Some way or other, God will provide for them in the way of duty and honest diligence, and verily they shall be fed. It may be applied spiritually; the word of God is the food of the soul. Christ is the word of God; by him we live. They must also remember the rebukes they had been under, and not without need. This use we should make of all our afflictions; by them let us be quickened to our duty. Moses also directs them to look forward to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward, to Canaan. Look which way we will, both to look back and to look forward will furnish us with arguments for obedience. Moses saw in that land a type of the better country. The gospel church is the New Testament Canaan, watered with the Spirit in his gifts and graces, planted with trees of righteousness, bearing fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the good land, in which nothing is wanting, and where is fulness of joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> note, and the contrast expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10-11</a>, between Palestine and Egypt.<p>The physical characteristics and advantages of a country like Palestine must have been quite strange to Israel at the time Moses was speaking: compare <a href="/deuteronomy/3-25.htm">Deuteronomy 3:25</a> note.

This second meaning is the more probable here both because of the following <span class="ital">springing forth</span>, and the parallelism between <span class="ital">depths</span> and <span class="ital">fountains</span> (the larger word for <span class="ital">fountains</span>) in <a href="/proverbs/8-24.htm" title="When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.">Proverbs 8:24</a>.

The phenomenon is due to the limestone formation of the land, the larger outbursts occurring mainly at the foot of a hill or great mound, where the harder dolomitic limestone impenetrable by water comes to the surface, forcing the water out.

Palestine is in the present day, on the whole, well supplied with water, though the distribution is very unequal, many parts being almost wholly destitute of supply, except from what may be collected from rain in tanks or cisterns; and there is no reason to suppose it was different in the ancient times. As compared, however, with the desert to which the Israelites had been so long accustomed, and even with Egypt from which they had escaped, the country on which they were about to enter was well watered. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In addition to the danger of being drawn aside to transgress the covenant, by sparing the Canaanites and their idols out of pusillanimous compassion and false tolerance, the Israelites would be especially in danger, after their settlement in Canaan, of falling into pride and forgetfulness of God, when enjoying the abundant productions of that land. To guard against this danger, Moses set before them how the Lord had sought to lead and train them to obedience by temptations and humiliations during their journey through the desert. In order that his purpose in doing this might be clearly seen, he commenced (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-1.htm">Deuteronomy 8:1</a>) with the renewed admonition to keep the whole law which he commanded them that day, that they might live and multiply and attain to the possession of the promised land (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>).</body></html>
