We cannot see why he should be pronounced cursed, except for the sake of that which was designed by “the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God,” that His Son Jesus Christ should bear our sins in His own body on the tree, and redeem us from the curse of the Law, by being “made a curse for us.”<p>Rashi’s note upon this shows how strangely the rays of truth are sometimes refracted in the Jewish mina: “‘He that is hanged is the curse of God’—that is, he is <span class= "ital">the King’s disgrace. </span>For man was made in the likeness of His image.

There is one reason here which has reference to Christ; He that is hanged is accursed of God; that is, it is the highest degree of disgrace and reproach. Those who see a man thus hanging between heaven and earth, will conclude him abandoned of both, and unworthy of either. Moses, by the Spirit, uses this phrase of being accursed of God, when he means no more than being treated most disgracefully, that it might afterward be applied to the death of Christ, and might show that in it he underwent the curse of the law for us; which proves his love, and encourages to faith in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There were four methods of execution in use among the ancient Jews; stoning (<a href="/exodus/17-4.htm">Exodus 17:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10</a>, etc.), burning <a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>, the sword <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>, and strangulation. The latter, though not named in Scripture, is regarded by the rabbis as the most common, and the proper one to be adopted when no other is expressly enjoined by the Law. Suspension, whether from cross, stake, or gallows, was not used as a mode of taking life, but was sometimes added after death as an enhancement of punishment. Pharaoh's chief baker <a href="/genesis/40-19.htm">Genesis 40:19</a> was hanged after being put to death by the sword; and similarly Joshua appears <a href="/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26</a> to have dealt with the five kings who made war against Gibeon.

This before mentioned, or any other that deserves death, any kind of death, as strangling, killing with the sword, burning and stoning, to which the Jews restrain it here: <p>and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him, on a tree; is condemned to stoning, and after that they hang him, as the Targum of Jonathan; and according to the Jewish Rabbins, as Jarchi observes, all that were stoned were to be hanged, and only men, not women (g); for it is remarked that it is said "him" and not "her" (h): about this there is a dispute in the Misnah (i);"all that are stoned are hanged, they are the words of R.

Eliezer; but the wise men say, a man is to be hanged, but no woman, to whom R. Eliezer replied, did not Simeon Ben Shetach hang women in Ashkelon? they answered him, he hung eighty women (at once), but they do not judge or condemn two in one day;''so that this was a particular case at a particular time, and not be drawn into an example: in the same place it is asked, <p>"how they hang one? they fix a beam in the earth, and a piece of wood goes out of it (near the top of it, as one of the commentator (k) remarks), and join his two hands together and hang him;''that is, by his hand, not by his neck, as with us, but rather in the crucifixion; only in that the hands are spread, and one hand is fastened to one part of the cross beam, and the other to the other end. <p>(g) Misn.

Consequently the first-born inherited twice as much as nay of the other sons. "Beginning of his strength" (as in <a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>). This right of primogeniture did not originate with Moses, but was simply secured by him against arbitrary invasion. It was founded, no doubt, upon hereditary tradition; just as we find in many other nations, that certain privileges are secured to the first-born sons above those born afterwards. </body></html>
