If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated&#8212;In the original and all other translations, the words are rendered "have had," referring to events that have already taken place; and that the "had" has, by some mistake, been omitted in our version, seems highly probable from the other verbs being in the past tense&#8212;"hers that was hated," not "hers that is hated"; evidently intimating that she (the first wife) was dead at the time referred to. Moses, therefore, does not here legislate upon the case of a man who has two wives at the same time, but on that of a man who has married twice in succession, the second wife after the decease of the first; and there was an obvious necessity for legislation in these circumstances; for the first wife, who was hated, was dead, and the second wife, the favorite, was alive; and with the feelings of a stepmother, she would urge her husband to make her own son the heir. This case has no bearing upon polygamy, which there is no evidence that the Mosaic code legalized.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He may not; </span> it is not lawful, because contrary to the rights and law of nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before the son, </span> or, <span class="ital">before the face of the son</span>, i.e. in his lifetime, as this phrase is understood, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/11-28.htm" title="And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.">Genesis 11:28</a> 16:12 25:18</span>. And when this phrase is rendered before another, it signifies only in the presence of another, but never notes the preference of one person to another, which the Hebrews express in another manner. And this may be added to intimate, that if the eldest son were dead, and had left a child, the father was free to give the right of his first-born unto his second son, rather than to the child of the eldest. Or this phrase may be an aggravation of the fact, whereby his father did in a manner spit in his face, and fasten a reproach upon him in his very sight and presence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath,....
