The longer it is before judgement comes, the more dreadful will it be at last. Amalek may remind us of the foes of our souls.

The law taught God's hatred of sin and of rebellion against Him by enjoining the extinction of the obstinate sinner. The Amalekites were a kindred people <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15-16</a>; and living as they did in the peninsula of Sinai, they could not but have well known the mighty acts God had done for His people in Egypt and the Red Sea; yet they manifested from the first a persistent hostility to Israel (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>, and note; <a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>).
