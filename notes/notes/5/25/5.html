And therefore the marriage specified was not necessarily between the brother and the brother’s wife, but might be between other representatives of the two persons in question. (See Ruth 4)<p>The law is older than Moses. We first hear of it in the household of Judah the son of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/38-8.htm" title="And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.">Genesis 38:8</a>). The violation of the law then was punished with <span class= "ital">death, </span>not with disgrace only.<p>But that which makes the law most memorable, is the teaching elicited from the lips of our Saviour by the question which the Sadducees raised upon it (see marginal reference). It is worth while to observe that the law itself demands that in some sense there should be <span class= "ital">a resurrection. </span>Boaz puts it thus (<a href="/ruth/4-5.htm" title="Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.">Ruth 4:5</a>), “to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.” Why should the name of the dead be kept up, if the dead has passed out of existence? We may well believe that this law was partly intended (like baptism for the dead, or like giving children the names of their departed progenitors) for the express purpose of keeping alive the hope of resurrection in the minds of the chosen people.<p>(11,12) <span class= "bld">When men strive together. . . .—</span>Another precept of humanity.

The law on this subject is not unique to the Jews, but is found (see <a href="/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>) in all essential respects the same among various Oriental nations, ancient and modern. The rules in these verses, like those upon divorce, do but incorporate existing immemorial usages, and introduce various wise and politic limitations and mitigations of them. The root of the obligation here imposed upon the brother of the deceased husband lies in the primitive idea of childlessness being a great calamity (compare <a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>; and note), and extinction of name and family one of the greatest that could happen (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/9-14.htm">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/109-12.htm">Psalm 109:12-15</a>). To avert this the ordinary rules as to intermarriage are in the case in question (compare <a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16</a>) set aside. The obligation was onerous (compare <a href="/ruth/4-6.htm">Ruth 4:6</a>), and might be repugnant; and it is accordingly considerably reduced and restricted by Moses. The duty is recognized as one of affection for the memory of the deceased; it is not one which could be enforced at law. That it continued down to the Christian era is apparent from the question on this point put to Jesus by the Sadducees (see the marginal references).<p><a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a><p>No child - literally, "no son."

But the Mosaic law rendered the custom obligatory (Mt 22:25) on younger brothers, or the nearest kinsman, to marry the widow (Ru 4:4), by associating the natural desire of perpetuating a brother's name with the preservation of property in the Hebrew families and tribes. If the younger brother declined to comply with the law, the widow brought her claim before the authorities of the place at a public assembly (the gate of the city); and he having declared his refusal, she was ordered to loose the thong of his shoe&#8212;a sign of degradation&#8212;following up that act by spitting on the ground&#8212;the strongest expression of ignominy and contempt among Eastern people.

Not only in the same country, province, town, or city, but in the same house; such who had been from their youth brought up together in their father's house, and now one of them being married, as the case put supposes, they that were unmarried might live with him, and especially if the father was dead; and so may except such as were abroad, and in foreign countries, or at such a distance that this law coals not well be observed by them; though the Targum of Jonathan, and so Jarchi, interpret it of their being united in an inheritance, all by virtue of relation having a claim to their father's inheritance; so that it mattered not where they dwelt, it is the relation that is regarded, and their right of inheritance; and the above Targum describes them as brethren on the father's side, and so Jarchi says excepts his brother on the mother's side; for brethren by the mother's side, in case of inheritance, and the marrying of a brother's wife, were not reckoned brethren, as Maimonides (h) observes; who adds, that there is no brotherhood but on the father's side. Some think that when there were no brethren in a strict and proper sense, the near kinsmen, sometimes called brethren, were to do the office here enjoined, and which they conclude from the case of Boaz and Ruth; but Aben Ezra contradicts this, and says that instance is no proof of it, it respecting another affair, not marriage, but redemption; and says that brethren, absolutely and strictly speaking are here meant; which is agreeably to their tradition (i): <p>and one of them die, and have no child: son, or daughter, son's son, or daughter's son, or daughter's daughter, as Jarchi notes; if there were either of these, children or grandchildren, of either sex, there was no obligation to marry a brother's wife; so, in the case put to Christ, there was no issue, the person was childless, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm">Matthew 22:24</a>, <p>the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger; by whom is meant not a Gentile, or a proselyte of the gate, or of righteousness, but any Israelite whatever, that was not of her husband's family; she might not marry out of the family; that is, she was refused by all, the design of the law being to secure inheritances, and continue them in families to which they belonged: <p>her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife; that is, supposing him to be unmarried, and this is indeed supposed in the first clause of the text, by dwelling with his brother; for had he been married, he would have dwelt with his wife and family apart; besides, if this law obliged a married man to marry his brother's wife, polygamy would be required and established by a law of God, which was never otherwise than permitted. This is to be understood of the eldest brother, as Jarchi, who is in an unmarried state; so it is said in the Misnah (k),"the command is upon the eldest to marry his brother's wife; if he will not, they go to all the brethren; if they will not, they return to the eldest; and say to him, upon thee is the commandment, either allow the shoe to be plucked off, or marry;''and such a course we find was taken among the Jews in our Lord's time, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-25.htm">Matthew 22:25</a>, <p>and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her; cohabit together as man and wife, in order to raise up seed to his brother, and perform all the offices and duties of an husband to a wife; but the marriage solemnity was not to take place when it was agreed to, until three months or ninety days had passed from the death of the brother, that it might be known whether she was with child or no by her husband, and in such a case this law had no force; so runs the Jewish canon (l)"a brother's wife may not pluck off the shoe, nor be married, until three months;''that is, after her husband's death. <p>(h) Hilchot Yebum Vechalitzah, c, 1, sect, 7.

Sometimes it is compulsory, sometimes only permissive, sometimes limited to the younger brother, sometimes enforced only where the widow has children, in order to provide for their education. In some Arab tribes ‘when a married brother dies, at the grave his surviving brother asks her relatives to give him the widow in marriage and says, “Give me compensation through her, etc.,” and his request is granted’ (Musil, <span class="ital">Ethn. Ber.</span> 426). No motive nor condition is stated. The custom has been traced to different origins—to the practice of polyandry, to the need of performing rites to the spirit of the deceased (for Levirate marriage and ancestor worship are often found together), and to the principle of ‘Baal-Marriage,’ that the wife was the property of her husband and so passed with the rest of his estate to the nearest of kin. The different forms of the institution among different peoples prove that it had different origins. In Israel there is no trace of an origin in polyandry; and but little evidence of a connection with ancestor worship. On the whole subject see Maine, <span class="ital">Early Law and Custom</span>, chs. iii. f.; W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Kinship</span>, etc., 122–135; Westermarck, <span class="ital">Human Marriage</span>; Benzinger and Nowack’s works on Hebrew Archaeology; and Driver’s summary notes, <span class="ital">Deut.</span> 280–285.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An early instance is given by J, Genesis 38, which (<span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/25-8.htm" title="Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;">Deuteronomy 25:8</a></span>) uses the same term for the duty of a husband’s brother, but implies that if brothers fail the duty might be assumed by another agnate and even by the husband’s father; further that not the firstborn only, but all the children of the new marriage, belonged to the dead man. In <a href="/context/ruth/1-11.htm" title="And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?...">Ruth 1:11-13</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-4.htm" title="And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.">Ruth 1:4</a>, where the Heb. term for Levirate marriage is not used (though the cognate <span class="ital">sister-in-law</span> occurs in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-15.htm" title="So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>), the right of Na‘omi’s widowed daughters-in-law to any further sons she might have had is implied; and in the want of these, regarded as a divine affliction, the right of marrying Ruth passes to the next of kin, with that of the redemption of the dead husband’s property; and again the son of the widow’s marriage with the kinsman is regarded as his son and not that of her first husband. In D’s law the duty of marrying the childless widow is limited to that brother of her dead husband who had been living with him, on the same estate; and the right of succession to the dead man is limited to the firstborn of the new marriage. In H, <a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm" title="You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife: it is your brother's nakedness.">Leviticus 18:16</a>, marriage with a brother’s wife is forbidden, and, <a href="/leviticus/20-21.htm" title="And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.">Leviticus 20:21</a>, is a defilement, cursed with childlessness. By some this has been regarded as the general rule, to which D’s provides in the interest of the family a carefully limited exception (Driver, <span class="ital">Deut.</span> 285, <span class="ital">Levit</span>. 88). It seems more likely that D’s law is (as we have seen) a modification of the old practice, entirely independent of H’s law. P, by allowing daughters to inherit (<a href="/context/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah....">Numbers 27:1-12</a>), abolished part of the need for Levirate marriages; but obviously D knows nothing of P’s law; for his own is limited to sons. Among the later Jews the law of D was observed but with the difference introduced by P. Not a sonless, but only a childless, marriage was now its occasion. See on <span class="ital"><a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deuteronomy 25:5</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-10.</span> <span class="accented">- Levirate marriages</span>. If a man who was married died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to raise up a successor to the deceased, who should be his heir. The brother who refused this duty must be publicly disgraced. The design of this institution - which was not originated by Moses, but came down from early times (<a href="/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>), and is to be found amongst ether nations than the Jews, and that even in the present day - was to preserve a family from becoming extinct and to secure the property of a family from passing into the hands of a stranger. The notion that the usage "had its natural roots in the desire inherent in man who is born for immortality, and connected with the hitherto undeveloped belief in an eternal life, to secure a continued personal existence for himself and immortality for his name through the perpetuation of his family, and in the life of the son who took his place" (Keil), seems wholly fanciful. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dwell together</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not necessarily in the same house, but in the same community or place (cf. <a href="/genesis/13-6.htm">Genesis 13:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-7.htm">Genesis 36:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And have no child</span>; literally, have no son; but this is rightly interpreted as meaning <span class="accented">child</span> (<span class="accented">so</span> the LXX.; Vulgate; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 23; <a href="/matthew/22-25.htm">Matthew 22:25</a>; Madmen., 'In Jibbum.,' 2:6-9); for, if the deceased left a daughter, the perpetuation of the family and the retention of the property might be secured through her (cf. <a href="/numbers/27-4.htm">Numbers 27:4</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Directions to allow strangers, widows, and orphans to glean in time of harvest (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>, and <a href="/leviticus/23-22.htm">Leviticus 23:22</a>).
