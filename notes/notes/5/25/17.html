This is confirmed by another reference to the same behaviour of ‘Amaleḳ in a passage which otherwise shows affinity to E (<a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.">1 Samuel 15:2</a>). Further, Israel’s attitude to ‘Amaleḳ under Saul and David, was one of implacable hostility. There is therefore no ground for supposing that this law is a late addition to D (Steuern., Berth., the latter of whom takes it for a piece of <span class="ital">haggadah</span>); and it falls in with D’s other laws on foreign nations, <a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-3.htm" title="An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:...">Deuteronomy 23:3-8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reference cannot be to E’s description of the pitched battle in Rephidim, in which Joshua discomfited ‘Amaleḳ (<a href="/context/exodus/17-8.htm" title="Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim....">Exodus 17:8-13</a>), nor indeed to any other single contest with that tribe; but is rather to the harassment which Israel suffered throughout the wilderness. Such cruel treatment of the stragglers and derelicts of the host by the wild Arabs of the desert is extremely probable (cp. Doughty, <span class="ital">Ar. Des.</span> ii. 153, etc.); and the memory of it would be bitter enough to account for such an early oracle against ‘Amaleḳ as is quoted by E, <a href="/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>, and for this law, as well as for the lasting hatred of ‘Amaleḳ by Israel (enforced as this was by ‘Amaleḳite raids on Israel after their settlement) and their desire for his extermination. See <a href="/1_samuel/14-48.htm" title="And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.">1 Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.">1 Samuel 15:2</a> f, <a href="/deuteronomy/27-8.htm" title="And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.">Deuteronomy 27:8</a> f., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-18.htm" title="Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your land, the increase of your cows, and the flocks of your sheep.">Deuteronomy 28:18</a> (which regards Saul’s fall as due to his not having fully executed God’s wrath on ‘Amaleḳ), <a href="/deuteronomy/30-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where the LORD your God has driven you,">Deuteronomy 30:1</a> f., <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm" title="Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.">2 Samuel 8:12</a>. Such feelings may well have continued after ‘Amaleḳ’s disappearance from the history of Israel; D’s restatement of them is on a level with the command to exterminate the Canaanites and other peoples of the land.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - Whilst in their intercourse  with each other the law of love and brotherly kindness was to predominate, it was to be otherwise in regard to the enemies of God and his people. Them they were to overcome by force; wickedness was to be removed by the extinction of the wicked. Moses has already repeatedly reminded the Israelites that they had utterly to destroy the wicked nations of Canaan; and he here closes this discourse by reminding them that there was a nation outside of Canaan which was also doomed, and which they were to root out. This was Amalek, which had attacked the Israelites in their journey at Rephidim, and had taken advantage of their exhausted condition to harass their rear and destroy those who, faint and weary, had lagged behind. For this they had been already punished by the Israelites, who, led on by Joshua, had turned upon them and discomfited them with the edge of the sword. This, however, was not enough; Amalek was to be utterly destroyed, and this the Israelites were to effect as soon as the Lord had given them rest in the Promised Land. It was not, however, till the time of David that this was done. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"But in order that the great independence which is here accorded to a childless widow in relation to her brother-in-law, might not be interpreted as a false freedom granted to the female sex" (Baumgarten), the law is added immediately afterwards, that a woman whose husband was quarrelling with another, and who should come to his assistance by laying hold of the secret parts of the man who was striking her husband, should have her hand cut off. </body></html>
