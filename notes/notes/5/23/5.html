Many of the Israelites being established on the east side of Jordan in the immediate neighborhood of those people, God raised this partition wall between them to prevent the consequences of evil communications. More favor was to be shown to Edomites and Egyptians&#8212;to the former from their near relationship to Israel; and to the latter, from their early hospitalities to the family of Jacob, as well as the many acts of kindness rendered them by private Egyptians at the Exodus (Ex 12:36). The grandchildren of Edomite or Egyptian proselytes were declared admissible to the full rights of citizenship as native Israelites; and by this remarkable provision, God taught His people a practical lesson of generosity and gratitude for special deeds of kindness, to the forgetfulness of all the persecution and ill services sustained from those two nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Forced Balaam to bless thee, who was hired and inclined to curse thee, if possibly he could. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Nevertheless, the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam,....
