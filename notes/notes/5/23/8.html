It seems to have been impossible to prevent some inter-marriages between Edom, Moab, and Israel when the Israelites passed through their land. Such a precept is suitable to the circumstances of Moses’ time. It would be less necessary when the bulk of the people had gone over the Jordan and left Moab and Edom far behind.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-8 We ought to value the privileges of God's people, both for ourselves and for our children, above all other advantages.

Many of the Israelites being established on the east side of Jordan in the immediate neighborhood of those people, God raised this partition wall between them to prevent the consequences of evil communications. More favor was to be shown to Edomites and Egyptians&#8212;to the former from their near relationship to Israel; and to the latter, from their early hospitalities to the family of Jacob, as well as the many acts of kindness rendered them by private Egyptians at the Exodus (Ex 12:36). The grandchildren of Edomite or Egyptian proselytes were declared admissible to the full rights of citizenship as native Israelites; and by this remarkable provision, God taught His people a practical lesson of generosity and gratitude for special deeds of kindness, to the forgetfulness of all the persecution and ill services sustained from those two nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Supposing their grandfather or great grandfather turned proselyte, and the children continue in that faith received by such ancestors. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The children that are begotten of them, Of such as became proselytes: <p>shall enter into the congregation of the Lord in their third generation; not in the third generation from the time that this law was made, but from the time that any of them should embrace the true religion; their sons were the second generation, and their grandchildren the third; and such might be admitted into the congregation, and be reckoned as of them, both in their civil and church state, and be capable of serving even offices among them, and of marriage with them, as the Targum of Jonathan; which some of the Jews interpret of males only, for females, according to them, might be married immediately as soon as made proselytes, in which way they account for the lawfulness of Solomon's marriage of Pharaoh's daughter (p). <p>(p) Vid.

Ges. thes. p. 781). The etymology of the word is obscure. The only other place in which it occurs is <a href="/zechariah/9-6.htm">Zechariah 9:6</a>; and it is neither contracted from &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1494;&#1512; (according to the Talmud, and Hitzig on <a href="/zechariah/9-6.htm">Zechariah 9:6</a>), nor from &#1494;&#1512; &#1502;&#1506;&#1501; (Geiger Urschr. p. 52), but in all probability is to be derived from a root &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;, synonymous with the Arabic word "to be corrupt, or foul." The additional clause, "not even in the tenth generation," precludes all possibility of their ever being received. Ten is the number of complete exclusion. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>, therefore, "for ever" is added. The reason is the same as in the case of mutilated persons, namely, their springing from a connection opposed to the divine order of the creation.</body></html>
