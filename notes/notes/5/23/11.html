Now if all this was necessary on account of ceremonial uncleanness, which as much as possible was to be avoided, how much more careful were they to be of moral uncleanness, as fornication, adultery, and all sorts of debauchery and lewdness? and yet nothing more frequent among those that are of the military order; it would be well if there was no occasion for the reproach Maimonides (q) casts upon the camps of the Heathens, among whom, no doubt, he means Christians, if not principally; when he observes that these orders were given, that this might be deeply fixed in the mind of every one, that their camp ought to be holy as the sanctuary of God, and not like the camps of the Gentiles, in which abound corruptions of all kinds, transgressions, rapines, thefts, and other sins. <p>(q) Moreh Nevochim, par. 3. c. 41. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Also no Ammonite or Moabite was to be received, not even in the tenth generation; not, however, because their forefathers were begotten in incest (<a href="/genesis/19-30.htm">Genesis 19:30</a>.), as Knobel supposes, but on account of the hostility they had manifested to the establishment of the kingdom of God. Not only had they failed to give Israel a hospitable reception on its journey (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), but they (viz., the king of the Moabites) had even hired Balaam to curse Israel. In this way they had brought upon themselves the curse which falls upon all those who curse Israel, according to the infallible word of God (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), the truth of which even Balaam was obliged to attest in the presence of Balak (<a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>); although out of love to Israel the Lord turned the curse of Balaam into a blessing (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>). For this reason Israel was never to seek their welfare and prosperity, i.e., to make this an object of its care ("to seek," as in <a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>); not indeed from personal hatred, for the purpose of repaying evil with evil, since this neither induced Moses to publish the prohibition, nor instigated Ezra when he put the law in force, by compelling the separation of all Ammonitish, Moabitish, and Canaanitish wives from the newly established congregation in Jerusalem (<a href="/ezra/9-12.htm">Ezra 9:12</a>). How far Moses was from being influenced by such motives of personal or national revenge is evident, apart from the prohibition in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a> against making war upon the Moabites and Ammonites, from the command which follows in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9</a> with reference to the Edomites and Egyptians. These nations had also manifested hostility to the Israelites. Edom had come against them when they desired to march peaceably through his land (<a href="/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>.), and the Pharaohs of Egypt had heavily oppressed them. Nevertheless, Israel as to keep the bond of kindred sacred ("he is thy brother"), and not to forget in the case of the Egyptians the benefits derived from their sojourn in their land. Their children might come into the congregation of the Lord in the third generation, i.e., the great-grandchildren of Edomites of Egyptians, who had lived as strangers in Israel (see at <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Such persons might be incorporated into the covenant nation by circumcision. </body></html>
