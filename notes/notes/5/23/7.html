Many of the Israelites being established on the east side of Jordan in the immediate neighborhood of those people, God raised this partition wall between them to prevent the consequences of evil communications. More favor was to be shown to Edomites and Egyptians&#8212;to the former from their near relationship to Israel; and to the latter, from their early hospitalities to the family of Jacob, as well as the many acts of kindness rendered them by private Egyptians at the Exodus (Ex 12:36). The grandchildren of Edomite or Egyptian proselytes were declared admissible to the full rights of citizenship as native Israelites; and by this remarkable provision, God taught His people a practical lesson of generosity and gratitude for special deeds of kindness, to the forgetfulness of all the persecution and ill services sustained from those two nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An Edomite; </span> the children of Edom; only the Amalekites are excepted by God’s particular order, and upon special reason, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/deuteronomy/25-17.htm" title="Remember what Amalek did to you by the way, when you were come forth out of Egypt;...">Deu 25:17-19</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy brother, </span> by Esau, Jacob’s brother. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou wast a stranger in his land, </span> and didst receive habitation, protection, and provision from them a long time, which kindness thou must not forget for their following persecution.

Not only animals (see at <a href="/leviticus/22-24.htm">Leviticus 22:24</a>), but men also, were castrated in this way. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1499;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; was one whose sexual member was cut off; Vulg. abscisso veretro. According to Mishnah Jebam. vi. 2, "contusus &#1491;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; est omnis, cujus testiculi vulnerati sunt, vel certe unus eorum; exsectus (&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;), cujus membrum virile praecisum est." In the modern East, emasculation is generally performed in this way (see Tournefort, Reise. ii. p. 259, and Burckhardt, Nubien, pp. 450, 451). The reason for the exclusion of emasculated persons from the congregation of Jehovah, i.e., not merely from office (officio et publico magistratu, Luth.) and from marriage with an Israelitish woman (Fag., C. a Lap., and others), but from admission into the covenant fellowship of Israel with the Lord, is to be found in the mutilation of the nature of man as created by God, which was irreconcilable with the character of the people of God. Nature is not destroyed by grace, but sanctified and transformed. This law, however, was one of the ordinances intended for the period of infancy, and has lost its significance with the spread of the kingdom of God over all the nations of the earth (<a href="/isaiah/56-4.htm">Isaiah 56:4</a>).</body></html>
