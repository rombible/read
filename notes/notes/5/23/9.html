The entire passage is continuous from <a href="/deuteronomy/23-9.htm" title="When the host goes forth against your enemies, then keep you from every wicked thing.">Deuteronomy 23:9</a>. Hence the whole discussion raised, after the appearance of Dr. Colenso’s work, on the size of the camp of Israel and the possibility of obeying this rule, was simply waste of words, and arose out of a misunderstanding of the matter under consideration. The sanitary value of the rule has been abundantly demonstrated in our own day.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">A paddle</span>—rather, a pin, or spike, like that with which Jael slew Sisera. The word for “weapon” does not occur elsewhere. The LXX. translates it <span class= "ital">“</span>a pin or tent-peg <span class= "ital">at thy girdle;” </span>the Hebrew word (<span class= "ital">âzên</span>) being like the Greek (<span class= "greekheb">ζώνη</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>But both Targums interpret the word as “weapon,” connecting it with the Hebrew <span class= "ital">zayin, </span>which has that meaning. The <span class= "ital">hinder end of the spear </span>in Abner’s hand was sharp enough to strike Asahel a fatal blow when he followed him (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm" title="However, he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.">2Samuel 2:23</a>). Saul’s spear also was “stuck in the ground at his bolster” (<a href="/1_samuel/26-7.htm" title="So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.">1Samuel 26:7</a>), probably with its point upwards, by the same spike.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of . . . thee.</span>—A most beautiful argument for purity in every sense.

Not only had they failed to give Israel a hospitable reception on its journey (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), but they (viz., the king of the Moabites) had even hired Balaam to curse Israel. In this way they had brought upon themselves the curse which falls upon all those who curse Israel, according to the infallible word of God (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), the truth of which even Balaam was obliged to attest in the presence of Balak (<a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>); although out of love to Israel the Lord turned the curse of Balaam into a blessing (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>). For this reason Israel was never to seek their welfare and prosperity, i.e., to make this an object of its care ("to seek," as in <a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>); not indeed from personal hatred, for the purpose of repaying evil with evil, since this neither induced Moses to publish the prohibition, nor instigated Ezra when he put the law in force, by compelling the separation of all Ammonitish, Moabitish, and Canaanitish wives from the newly established congregation in Jerusalem (<a href="/ezra/9-12.htm">Ezra 9:12</a>). How far Moses was from being influenced by such motives of personal or national revenge is evident, apart from the prohibition in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a> against making war upon the Moabites and Ammonites, from the command which follows in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9</a> with reference to the Edomites and Egyptians. These nations had also manifested hostility to the Israelites. Edom had come against them when they desired to march peaceably through his land (<a href="/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>.), and the Pharaohs of Egypt had heavily oppressed them. Nevertheless, Israel as to keep the bond of kindred sacred ("he is thy brother"), and not to forget in the case of the Egyptians the benefits derived from their sojourn in their land. Their children might come into the congregation of the Lord in the third generation, i.e., the great-grandchildren of Edomites of Egyptians, who had lived as strangers in Israel (see at <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Such persons might be incorporated into the covenant nation by circumcision. </body></html>
