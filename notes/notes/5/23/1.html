As a set off to this apparent harshness towards the man who had been thus treated, we must read <a href="/context/isaiah/56-3.htm" title="Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD has utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.">Isaiah 56:3-4</a>, in which a special promise is given to the eunuchs that keep God’s Sabbaths and take hold of His covenant. God will give to them <span class= "ital">within His house and within His walls </span>“<span class= "ital">a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters</span>—an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.” As a special calamity it was foretold to Hezekiah that some of his descendants should be eunuchs in the palace of the King of Babylon. But Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in whom this prophecy was fulfilled, have ennobled the “children that are of their sort” for evermore.<p>We have no means of knowing whether the eunuchs that were in the service of the kings of Israel or Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm" title="And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.">1Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-9.htm" title="Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten here Micaiah the son of Imlah.">1Kings 22:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-6.htm" title="And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.">2Kings 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-32.htm" title="And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who?

(See Gal. 5, 12, Revised New Testament, Margin, and Bishop Lightfoot’s comment on that place.) St. Paul’s words in Galatians receive a double meaning from this law. By doing what he refers to, they would cut themselves off from the congregation of the Lord. Rashi also gives another meaning, which would connect the precept with <a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When any man has a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.">Leviticus 15:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD....">Deuteronomy 23:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">He that is wounded — </span>It is generally agreed that Moses is here speaking of eunuchs. <span class="ital">Shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord — </span>The meaning is, not that they should be debarred from the public worship of the true God, as the phrase sometimes signifies, for that privilege was granted to all nations indiscriminately, provided they renounced idolatry, <a href="/exodus/12-48.htm" title="And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-18.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whatever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering;">Leviticus 22:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-14.htm" title="And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.">Numbers 9:14</a>. But the sense seems to be, that such a one should not be deemed an Israelite, nor have his name entered in the public register; and especially that he should not be admitted to honours or offices, either in the church or commonwealth of Israel, or be allowed to be one of the society of elders, or rulers of the people, or to sit in council with them. The same privilege was denied to those here termed <span class="ital">bastards, </span>under which name the Jews comprehended not only those begotten in simple fornication, but also the offspring of all such incestuous marriages, as are prohibited Leviticus 18.

Such persons, exhibiting a mutilation of that human nature which was made in God's image, were rejected from the covenant entirely.

The Old Testament itself foretells <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-5</a> the removal of this ban when under the kingdom of Messiah the outward and emblematic perfection and sanctity of Israel should be fulfilled in their inner meaning by the covenanted presence and work of the Holy Spirit in the Church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 23<p>De 23:1-25.

He that is wounded &#8230;, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord&#8212;"To enter into the congregation of the Lord" means either admission to public honors and offices in the Church and State of Israel, or, in the case of foreigners, incorporation with that nation by marriage. The rule was that strangers and foreigners, for fear of friendship or marriage connections with them leading the people into idolatry, were not admissible till their conversion to the Jewish faith. But this passage describes certain limitations of the general rule. The following parties were excluded from the full rights and privileges of citizenship: (1) Eunuchs&#8212;It was a very ancient practice for parents in the East by various arts to mutilate their children, with a view to training them for service in the houses of the great. (2) Bastards&#8212;Such an indelible stigma in both these instances was designed as a discouragement to practices that were disgraceful, but too common from intercourse with foreigners. (3) Ammonites and Moabites&#8212;Without provocation they had combined to engage a soothsayer to curse the Israelites; and had further endeavored, by ensnaring them into the guilt and licentious abominations of idolatry, to seduce them from their allegiance to God.Who are to be excluded from the congregation, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD....">Deu 23:1-6</a></span>.
