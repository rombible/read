It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm.

As mediator He gave him the two tables of stone, upon which He had written the decalogue (cf. <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). This statement somewhat forestalls the historical course; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10-11</a>, it is repeated again in its proper historical connection. </body></html>
