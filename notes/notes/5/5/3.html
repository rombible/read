Moses might truly say, God made this covenant with them then present before him; for a great part of them, even all who were under twenty years of age, when God gave the law on mount Sinai, were at Horeb; and, as God foreknew that their parents would die in the wilderness for their unbelief and murmuring, and would have comparatively little profit from that covenant, he especially intended it for those who should enter Canaan, and who, with their posterity, should be governed and benefited by it from generation to generation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Moses demands attention.

The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us&#8212;The meaning is, "not with our fathers" only, "but with us" also, assuming it to be "a covenant" of grace. It may mean "not with our fathers" at all, if the reference is to the peculiar establishment of the covenant of Sinai; a law was not given to them as to us, nor was the covenant ratified in the same public manner and by the same solemn sanctions. Or, finally, the meaning may be "not with our fathers" who died in the wilderness, in consequence of their rebellion, and to whom God did not give the rewards promised only to the faithful; but "with us," who alone, strictly speaking, shall enjoy the benefits of this covenant by entering on the possession of the promised land.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With our fathers; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

That is, not with them only, as Jarchi, Aben Ezra, and Abendana remark; for certain it is that this covenant was made, or law was given, to the immediate fathers of this present generation of Israelites, whose carcasses had fallen in the wilderness; unless this is to be understood of their more remote ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with whom the covenant of grace was made, or afresh made manifest, especially with the former; when the law, the covenant here spoken of, was not delivered until four hundred and thirty years after, <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>, <p>but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day; many of them were then present at the giving of the law, and though under twenty years of age, could remember it, and the circumstances of it; and besides, they were the same people to whom it was given, though not consisting wholly of the same individuals. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, <i>even</i> us, who <i>are</i> all of us here alive this day.</span><p>(a) Some read, God made not this covenant, that is, in such ample forth and with such signs and wonders.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">not … with our fathers</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">forefathers</span>, i.e. the Patriarchs—‘those great Grandfathers of thy Church1[119]—with whom, however, D recognises a previous covenant, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-31.htm" title="(For the LORD your God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.">Deuteronomy 4:31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-12.htm" title="Why it shall come to pass, if you listen to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD your God shall keep to you the covenant and the mercy which he swore to your fathers:">Deuteronomy 7:12</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm" title="But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>.

Dillmann meets the contradiction by taking <a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm" title="And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.">Deuteronomy 2:14</a> f. as a later gloss.

A more probable explanation is that the speaker is made to ignore the tradition of the death of those who had been adults at Ḥoreb (of which the author cannot well have been ignorant) for rhetorical purposes: (1) to emphasise the contrast between the Patriarchs and Israel after the Exodus; and (2) to emphasise the new responsibility which the Ḥoreb covenant had laid on the latter, in all its successive generations.

"On their coming out of Egypt," i.e., not "after they had come out," but during the march, before they had reached the goal of their journeyings, viz., (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-46.htm">Deuteronomy 4:46</a>) when they were still on the other side of the Jordan.

The importance of this possession as the first-fruit and pledge of the fulfilment of the further promises of God, led Moses to mention again, though briefly, the defeat of the two kings of the Amorites, together with the conquest of their land, just as he had done before in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-32.htm">Deuteronomy 2:32-36</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-17</a>.
