God's appearances have always been terrible to man, ever since the fall; but Christ, having taken away sin, invites us to come boldly to the throne of grace. They were in a good mind, under the strong convictions of the word they heard. Many have their consciences startled by the law who have them not purified; fair promises are extorted from them, but no good principles are fixed and rooted in them. God commended what they said. He desires the welfare and salvation of poor sinners. He has given abundant proof that he does so; he gives us time and space to repent. He has sent his Son to redeem us, promised his Spirit to those who pray for him, and has declared that he has no pleasure in the ruin of sinners. It would be well with many, if there were always such a heart in them, as there seems to be sometimes; when they are under conviction of sin, or the rebukes of providence, or when they come to look death in the face. The only way to be happy, is to be holy. Say to the righteous, It shall be well with them. Let believers make it more and more their study and delight, to do as the Lord God hath commanded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses contain a much fuller narrative of the events briefly described in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-21</a>. Here it is important to call attention to the fact that it was on the entreaties of the people that Moses had taken on him to be the channel of communication between God and them. God approved <a href="/deuteronomy/5-28.htm">Deuteronomy 5:28</a> the request of the people, because it showed a feeling of their own unworthiness to enter into direct communion with God. The terrors of Sinai had done their work; they had awakened the consciousness of sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. Oh, that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me&#8212;God can bestow such a heart, and has promised to give it, wherever it is asked (Jer 32:40). But the wish which is here expressed on the part of God for the piety and steadfast obedience of the Israelites did not relate to them as individuals, so much as a nation, whose religious character and progress would have a mighty influence on the world at large.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Go say to them, get you into your tents again.

God approved of what the people said, because it sprang from a consciousness of the unworthiness of any sinner to come into the presence of the holy God; and He added, "Would that there were always this heart in them to fear Me," i.e., would that they were always of the same mind to fear Me and keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and their children for ever. He then directed the people to return to their tents, and appointed Moses as the mediator, to whom He would address all the law, that he might teach it to the people (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a>). Having been thus entreated by the people to take the office of mediator, and appointed to that office by the Lord, Moses could very well bring his account of these events to a close (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>), by exhorting them to observe carefully all the commandments of the Lord, and not to turn aside to the right hand or to the left, i.e., not to depart in any way from the mode of life pointed out in the commandments (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-20.htm">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, etc.), that it might be well with them, etc. (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>). &#1493;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, perfect with &#1493; rel. instead of the imperfect. </body></html>
