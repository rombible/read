It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The exhortation to observe the Sabbath and allow time of rest to servants (compare <a href="/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>) is pointed by reminding the people that they too were formerly servants themselves. The bondage in Egypt and the deliverance from it are not assigned as grounds for the institution of the Sabbath, which is of far older date (see <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>), but rather as suggesting motives for the religious observance of that institution. The Exodus was an entrance into rest from the toils of the house of bondage, and is thought actually to have occurred on the Sabbath day or "rest" day.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou&#8212;This is a different reason for the observance of the Sabbath from what is assigned in Ex 20:8-11, where that day is stated to be an appointed memorial of the creation. But the addition of another motive for the observance does not imply any necessary contrariety to the other; and it has been thought probable that, the commemorative design of the institution being well known, the other reason was specially mentioned on this repetition of the law, to secure the privilege of sabbatic rest to servants, of which, in some Hebrew families, they had been deprived. In this view, the allusion to the period of Egyptian bondage (De 5:15), when they themselves were not permitted to observe the Sabbath either as a day of rest or of public devotion, was peculiarly seasonable and significant, well fitted to come home to their business and bosoms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Remember that thou wast a servant, </span> and therefore art highly obliged both to serve that God who redeemed thee, especially upon his own day, and not to grudge thy servants their rest upon that day. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,....

God’s rest on the seventh day from the work of creation. The influence of P on Ex. proves the D form to be the more original. Note that while it enforces the philanthropic motive for Sabbath-observance it is as theological as the other, and, like it, refers to God’s action as the ultimate sanction of the Sabbath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">remember that thou wast a</span> <span class="bld">bondman</span>] The same motive is expressed for the laws enforcing liberality to slaves, <a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm" title="And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing to day.">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>; the duty of sharing the joy of the feasts with needy dependents, <a href="/deuteronomy/16-12.htm" title="And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.">Deuteronomy 16:12</a>; and justice and generosity to the poor, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-18.htm" title="But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you there: therefore I command you to do this thing.">Deuteronomy 24:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-22.htm" title="And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing.">Deuteronomy 24:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a mighty hand and … a stretched out arm</span>] See on <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm" title="Or has God assayed to go and take him a nation from the middle of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to keep</span>] lit. <span class="ital">to do</span> or <span class="ital">make</span>, i.e. to carry into effect; used by D also of the Passover, <a href="/deuteronomy/16-1.htm" title="Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover to the LORD your God: for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>; more frequently in P: of the Sabbath, <a href="/exodus/31-16.htm" title="Why the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.">Exodus 31:16</a>; of the Passover, <a href="/exodus/12-47.htm" title="All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.">Exodus 12:47</a> f.; <a href="/context/numbers/9-4.htm" title="And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover....">Numbers 9:4-6</a>, etc.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In vv. 6-21, the ten covenant words are repeated from <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>, with only a few variations, which have already been discussed in connection with the exposition of the decalogue at <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-14</a>. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-33</a>, Moses expounds still further the short account in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-21</a>, viz., that after the people had heard the ten covenant words, in their alarm at the awful phenomena in which the Lord revealed His glory, they entreated him to stand between as mediator, that God Himself might not speak to them any further, and that they might not die, and then promised that they would hearken to all that the Lord should speak to him (<a href="/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a> -31). His purpose in doing so was to link on the exhortation in vv. 32, 33, to keep all the commandments of the Lord and do them, which paves the way for passing to the exposition of the law which follows. "A great voice" (<a href="/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>) is an adverbial accusative, signifying "with a great voice" (cf. Ges. 118, 3). "And He added no more:" as in <a href="/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>. God spoken the ten words directly to the people, and then no more; i.e., everything further He addressed to Moses alone, and through his mediation to the people. As mediator He gave him the two tables of stone, upon which He had written the decalogue (cf. <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). This statement somewhat forestalls the historical course; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10-11</a>, it is repeated again in its proper historical connection. </body></html>
