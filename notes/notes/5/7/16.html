Whatever brings us into a snare, brings us under a curse. Let us be constant to our duty, and we cannot question the constancy of God's mercy. Diseases are God's servants; they go where he sends them, and do what he bids them. It is therefore good for the health of our bodies, thoroughly to mortify the sin of our souls; which is our rule of duty. Yet sin is never totally destroyed in this world; and it actually prevails in us much more than it would do, if we were watchful and diligent. In all this the Lord acts according to the counsel of his own will; but that counsel being hid from us, forms no excuse for our sloth and negligence, of which it is in no degree the cause. We must not think, that because the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of the enemies of the soul, are not done immediately, therefore they will never be done. God will do his own work in his own method and time; and we may be sure that they are always the best. Thus corruption is driven out of the hearts of believers by little and little. The work of sanctification is carried on gradually; but at length there will be a complete victory. Pride, security, and other sins that are common effects of prosperity, are enemies more dangerous than beasts of the field, and more apt to increase upon us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There seems to be here not so much as a reference to the plagues inflicted miraculously by God on Egypt (compare <a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>), as to the terrible diseases with which, above other countries, Egypt was infested.

To this end He emphatically carries out still further the thought of retribution, by adding &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, "to destroy him" (the hater), and &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, "He delays not to His hater (sc., to repay him); He will repay him to his face."
