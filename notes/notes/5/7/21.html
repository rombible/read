Whatever brings us into a snare, brings us under a curse. Let us be constant to our duty, and we cannot question the constancy of God's mercy. Diseases are God's servants; they go where he sends them, and do what he bids them. It is therefore good for the health of our bodies, thoroughly to mortify the sin of our souls; which is our rule of duty. Yet sin is never totally destroyed in this world; and it actually prevails in us much more than it would do, if we were watchful and diligent. In all this the Lord acts according to the counsel of his own will; but that counsel being hid from us, forms no excuse for our sloth and negligence, of which it is in no degree the cause. We must not think, that because the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of the enemies of the soul, are not done immediately, therefore they will never be done. God will do his own work in his own method and time; and we may be sure that they are always the best. Thus corruption is driven out of the hearts of believers by little and little. The work of sanctification is carried on gradually; but at length there will be a complete victory. Pride, security, and other sins that are common effects of prosperity, are enemies more dangerous than beasts of the field, and more apt to increase upon us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There seems to be here not so much as a reference to the plagues inflicted miraculously by God on Egypt (compare <a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>), as to the terrible diseases with which, above other countries, Egypt was infested.

The blessing is then particularized, by a further expansion of <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25-27</a>, as a blessing upon the fruit of the body, the fruits of the field and soil, and the rearing of cattle. &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1512;, see <a href="/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>. &#1510;&#1488;&#1503; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-18.htm">Deuteronomy 28:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-51.htm">Deuteronomy 28:51</a>, and certainly signifies the young increase of the flocks. It is probably a Canaanitish word, derived from Ashtoreth (Astharte), the female deity of the Canaanites, which was regarded as the conceiving and birth-giving principle of nature, literally Veneres, i.e., amores gregis, hence soboles (Ges.); just as the Latin poets employ the name Ceres to signify the corn, Venus for love and sexual intercourse, and Lucina for birth. On <a href="/deuteronomy/7-14.htm">Deuteronomy 7:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm">Deuteronomy 7:15</a>, see <a href="/exodus/23-26.htm">Exodus 23:26</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm">Deuteronomy 7:15</a>, the promise of the preservation of Israel from all diseases (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, and <a href="/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25</a>) is strengthened by the addition of the clause, "all the evil diseases of Egypt," by which, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>, we are probably to understand chiefly the malignant species of leprosy called elephantiasis, and possibly also the plague and other malignant forms of disease. In Egypt, diseases for the most part readily assume a very dangerous character. Pliny (h. n. xxvi. 1) calls Egypt the genitrix of contagious pestilence, and modern naturalists have confirmed this (see Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 215; and Pruner, Krankheiten des Orients, pp. 460ff.). Diseases of this kind the Lord would rather bring upon the enemies of Israel. The Israelites, on the other hand, should be so strong and vigorous, that they would devour, i.e., exterminate, all the nations which their God would give into their hands (cf. <a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>). With this thought Moses reverts with emphasis to the command to root out the Canaanites without reserve, and not to serve their gods, because they would become a snare to them (see <a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>); and then in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-17.htm">Deuteronomy 7:17-26</a> he carries out still further the promise in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27-30</a> of the successful subjugation of the Canaanites through the assistance of the Lord, and sweeps away all the objections that a weak faith might raise to the execution of the divine command.</body></html>
