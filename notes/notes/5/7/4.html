Those who are in communion with God, must have no communication with the unfruitful works of darkness. Limiting the orders to destroy, to the nations here mentioned, plainly shows that after ages were not to draw this into a precedent. A proper understanding of the evil of sin, and of the mystery of a crucified Saviour, will enable us to perceive the justice of God in all his punishments, temporal and eternal. We must deal decidedly with our lusts that war against our souls; let us not show them any mercy, but mortify, and crucify, and utterly destroy them. Thousands in the world that now is, have been undone by ungodly marriages; for there is more likelihood that the good will be perverted, than that the bad will be converted. Those who, in choosing yoke-fellows, keep not within the bounds of a profession of religion, cannot promise themselves helps meet for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10</a> note.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-6. thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them&#8212;This relentless doom of extermination which God denounced against those tribes of Canaan cannot be reconciled with the attributes of the divine character, except on the assumption that their gross idolatry and enormous wickedness left no reasonable hope of their repentance and amendment. If they were to be swept away like the antediluvians or the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, as incorrigible sinners who had filled up the measure of their iniquities, it mattered not to them in what way the judgment was inflicted; and God, as the Sovereign Disposer, had a right to employ any instruments that pleased Him for executing His judgments. Some think that they were to be exterminated as unprincipled usurpers of a country which God had assigned to the posterity of Eber and which had been occupied ages before by wandering shepherds of that race, till, on the migration of Jacob's family into Egypt through the pressure of famine, the Canaanites overspread the whole land, though they had no legitimate claim to it, and endeavored to retain possession of it by force. In this view their expulsion was just and proper. The strict prohibition against contracting any alliances with such infamous idolaters was a prudential rule, founded on the experience that "evil communications corrupt good manners" [1Co 15:33], and its importance or necessity was attested by the unhappy examples of Solomon and others in the subsequent history of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. There is manifest danger of apostacy and idolatry from such matches; which reason doth both limit the law to such of these as were unconverted, otherwise Salmon married Rahab, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm" title="And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;">Matthew 1:5</a></span>, and enlarge it to other idolatrous nations, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/11-2.htm" title="Of the nations concerning which the LORD said to the children of Israel, You shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon joined to these in love.">1 Kings 11:2</a> <a href="/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a> <a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:">Nehemiah 13:23</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For they will turn away thy son from following me,....
