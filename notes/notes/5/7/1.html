Limiting the orders to destroy, to the nations here mentioned, plainly shows that after ages were not to draw this into a precedent. A proper understanding of the evil of sin, and of the mystery of a crucified Saviour, will enable us to perceive the justice of God in all his punishments, temporal and eternal. We must deal decidedly with our lusts that war against our souls; let us not show them any mercy, but mortify, and crucify, and utterly destroy them. Thousands in the world that now is, have been undone by ungodly marriages; for there is more likelihood that the good will be perverted, than that the bad will be converted.

Of the ten nations named by God in his promise to Abraham, only six are mentioned here, those omitted being the Kenites, the Kennizites, the Kadmonites, and the Rephaim. The Rephaim were by this time extinct as a tribe, Og, "the last of the Rephaim," having been conquered, and he and his people destroyed by the Israelites. The three other tribes lay probably beyond the confines of Canaan, in that region promised to Abraham, but which was not included in the territory conquered by the people under Joshua. This may account for their not being mentioned here. One nation, the Hivites, appears here which is not in the enumeration in Genesis. This name seems to have been borne by more tribes than one, or by a tribe existing in divisions widely scattered, for we find the Hivite in the center of Palestine (<a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>), in the Shephelah (<a href="/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>), in the laud of Mizpeh under Hermon (<a href="/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), "in Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entering in of Hamath" (<a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>), and among tribes in the north of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/10-17.htm">Genesis 10:17</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-15.htm">1 Chronicles 1:15</a>). Their principal settlement was probably in that part of the country where the Antilibanus range terminates in Mount Hermon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20-25</a>, the teaching to the children, which is only briefly hinted at in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, is more fully explained. The Israelites were to instruct their children and descendants as to the nature, meaning, and object of the commandments of the Lord; and in reply to the inquiries of their sons, to teach them what the Lord had done for the redemption of Israel out of the bondage of Egypt, and how He had brought them into the promised land, and thus to awaken in the younger generation love to the Lord and to His commandments.
