It is simply a symbolic account of the age long struggle between good and evil. This is the view of most liberals.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> It is historical—Here two kinds of history are in mind.<p class="spc"></p><p class="letter"><span class="let">a.</span> Past history—This is often called the preterist theory. “Preterist” is from a Latin word that means “past.” Dr. Charles Ryrie writes: “Thus, the preterist interpreters are those who see Revelation as having already been fulfilled in the early history of the church. Chapters 5-11 are said to record the church’s victory over Judaism; chapters 12-19 her victory over pagan Rome; and 20-22 her glory because of these victories. The persecutions described are those of Nero and Domitian, and the entire book was fulfilled by the time of Constantine (A.D. 312)” (<i>Revelation,</i> p. 8). <p class="letter"><span class="let">b.</span> Continuous history—Again to quote Ryrie: “This interpretative viewpoint states that in Revelation there is a panorama of the history of the church from the days of John to the end of the age. It holds that the book has been in the process of being fulfilled throughout the whole Christian era. Those who hold this view see in the symbols the rise of papacy, the corruption of the church and the various wars throughout church history. Most of the reformers interpreted the book in this manner” (<i>Revelation,</i> pp. 8-9).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> It is prophetical—This view sees those events from chapter 4 onward as yet to be fulfilled. This view alone does justice to the book. Revelation, like all other books in the Bible, is to be taken in the plain, normal sense of the words. To do otherwise is to dishonor Christ, the divine Author. Dr. David L. Cooper once suggested: “When the plain sense of scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense.”<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> There were four separate steps involved in the writing of this book (1:1):<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> From the Father<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> To the Son<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> To an angel<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> To John<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">11.</span> This book lists more titles for the Savior than does any other book in the Bible.<p class="num"><span class="nm">12.</span> It begins and ends with the Lord Jesus at the center of things (1:13; 22:1-5). It contains more Old Testament references than any other New Testament book. H. B. Swete observes: “Of the 404 verses in Revelation, no less than 278 contain references to the Old Testament.”<p class="num"><span class="nm">13.</span> Revelation is the only biblical book to open with a special dedication: <i>“And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

H. Snell has aptly summarized the position held by the Lamb in Revelation: “In the Revelation, THE LAMB is the centre around which all else is clustered, the foundation on which everything lasting is built, the nail on which all hangs, the object to which all points, and the spring from which all blessing proceeds. THE LAMB is the light, the glory, the life, the Lord of Heaven and earth, from whose face all defilement must flee away, and in whose presence fullness of joy is known. Hence, we cannot go far in the study of the Revelation, without seeing THE LAMB, like direction-posts along the road, to remind us that He who did by Himself purge our sins is now highly exalted, and that to Him every knee must bow, and every tongue confess.”<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Revelation may be compared to the book of Genesis.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis we read: <i>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth”</i> (1:1). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation we read: <i>“I saw a new heaven and a new earth”</i> (21:1).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis we see described the <i>first Adam</i> with his wife Eve in the Garden of Eden, reigning over the earth (1:27-28). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation we see described the <i>last Adam</i> with his wife, the church in the City of God, reigning over all the universe (21:9).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis we are told: <i>“And the gathering together of the waters called he Seas”</i> (1:10). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation we are told: <i>“and there was no more sea”</i> (21:1).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis God created the sun and moon, the day and the night (1:5-16). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation: <i>“There shall be no night there”</i> (22:5). <i>“And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof”</i> (21:23).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis the Tree of Life is denied to sinful humans (3:22). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation the Tree of Life <i>“yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations”</i> (22:2).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis people hear God say: <i>“Cursed is the ground for thy sake”</i> (3:17). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation people will hear God say, <i>“And there shall be no more curse”</i> (22:3).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis Satan appears to torment human beings (3:1). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation Satan disappears, himself to be tormented forever (20:10).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis the old earth was punished through a flood (7:12). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation the new earth shall be purified through a fire (2 Pet. 3:6-12; Rev. 21:1).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis man’s early home was beside a river (2:10). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation our eternal home will be beside a river—<i>“And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb”</i> (22:1).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis the patriarch Abraham weeps for Sarah (23:2). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation the children of Abraham will have God himself wipe away all tears from their eyes (21:4).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Genesis God destroys an earthly city, wicked Sodom, from the sands (ch. 19). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Revelation, God presents a heavenly city, New Jerusalem, from the skies (21:2).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Genesis ends with a believer in Egypt, lying in a coffin (50:1-3). <p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Revelation ends with all believers in eternity, reigning forever (22:5).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Revelation may be compared to the book of <i>Daniel.</i><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Concerning the indestructible Jewish nation (Dan. 3, 6; cf.

Verse 18 in chapter one answers the first question:<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” </i><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">The remaining verses answer questions two and three where Jesus is seen dressed in His high priestly garments in heaven ministering to His churches and people.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WITNESSES OF THE LAMB</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">These who bear testimony to the Savior are described as follows:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Seven golden candlesticks, or lampstands (2:1), a reference to the seven key churches in Asia Minor.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The servants of our God, and the first fruits unto God and the Lamb (7:3; 14:4), a reference to 144,000 Jewish evangelists.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> The two olive trees and lampstands (11:4), a reference to the two prophets of God later martyred by the antichrist.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WORSHIP OF THE LAMB (4, 5)</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> The personalities involved (who they were)<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">—24 elders<p class="reg">—4 special living creatures<p class="reg">—a great multitude of angels<p class="reg">—all the redeemed<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The reasons involved (why they worshipped)<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">—thanking God for His great work in CREATION (4:11)<p class="reg">—thanking God for His great work in REDEMPTION (5:9, 10)<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><u>Note</u>: Someday even the fallen angels and unsaved human beings will acknowledge both the sovereignty and eternal reign of the Lamb!<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever”</i> (5:13).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WRATH OF THE LAMB</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?”</i> (Rev. 6:15-17)<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">No doubt the most vivid example of a divine oxymoron can be seen, repeated twice, in these verses, namely, THE WRATH OF THE LAMB! By simple definition an oxymoron is in essence a contradiction of terms, such as jumbo shrimp, Christian atheist, cold heat, etc. In other words, it cannot be both. But not so in Rev. 6. This gentle Lamb who once came providing salvation <u>for</u> man, NOW becomes the angry Lamb, pouring out judgment <u>upon</u> man!<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">This wrath unfolds itself in a five-fold manner:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> As seen by the seal judgments (6)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> As seen by the trumpet judgments (8, 9, 11:15)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> As seen by the vial (or bowl) judgments (15, 16)<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> As seen by the judgments upon Babylon (17, 18)<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> As seen by the Great White Throne Judgment (20:11-15)<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Never before or never again will the full, unchecked fury of an angry God be poured out in such measure upon this sinful world! The following passages perhaps say it best:<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</i> (Rev. 6:15-17).<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name”</i> (Rev. 14:9-11).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">A brief summary of this five-fold divine punishment would include:<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> As seen by the SEAL judgments—<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><u>First</u>—Cold war, unrest among the nations<p class="reg"><u>Second</u>—Open war, blood and death<p class="reg"><u>Third</u>—World-wide famine<p class="reg"><u>Fourth</u>—25% of humanity killed by the sword, pestilence, and wild beasts<p class="reg"><u>Fifth</u>—Cry of the martyred for God to avenge their deaths<p class="reg"><u>Sixth</u>—Great earthquake, resulting in every mountain and island being moved out of place, the sun to be blocked out, the moon to become as blood, the sky to be torn apart like a scroll<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> As seen by the TRUMPET judgments—<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><u>First</u>—Hail and fire, causing one-third of the earth to be burned<p class="reg"><u>Second</u>—Falling meteorite (or asteroid) destroying one-third of sea life and ships<p class="reg"><u>Third</u>—Another meteorite to poison one-third of the rivers and springs of water<p class="reg"><u>Fourth</u>—One-third of the light from the sun, moon, and stars to be diminished<p class="reg"><u>Fifth</u>—The first of two demonic invasions, resulting in all unsaved being tortured for five months<p class="reg"><u>Sixth</u>—The second demonic invasions releasing 200 million of these hellish creatures; one-third of the unsaved to die<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> As seen by the VIAL or BOWL judgments—<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><u>First</u>—Grievous, malignant sores to plague the bodies of the unsaved<p class="reg"><u>Second</u>—The death of all sea life<p class="reg"><u>Third</u>—The (probable) death of all fresh water life<p class="reg"><u>Fourth</u>—Sun flares so intense so as to scorch human bodies<p class="reg"><u>Fifth</u>—An unnatural darkness to fall upon the domain of the antichrist bringing with it some kind of pain<p class="reg"><u>Sixth</u>—The drying up of the Euphrates River in the Middle East in preparation for Armageddon <p class="reg"><u>Seventh</u>—The greatest earthquake of all time, accompanied by the greatest hailstones, with each hailstone weighing 100 pounds!<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> As seen by the judgment upon Babylon— <p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">It is the opinion of this author that ancient Babylon will be rebuilt and eventually become the headquarters of the antichrist. Furthermore this city will serve as the center for two godless systems, the religious (described in Rev. 17), and the economic (referred to in Rev. 18). Both systems will eventually be destroyed by God, the religious indirectly and the economic, directly.<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> As seen by the Great White Throne Judgment—<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire”</i> (Rev. 20:11-15).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WOMAN AND THE LAMB (12)</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">John had probably never witnessed anything exactly like this before. The scene was both fascinating and frightening. Here is his actual eye witness account in regard to what he saw:<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him; And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ”</i> (Rev. 12:1-9; 11-17).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Many evangelical Bible students would identify the persecuted woman as Israel. She is seen as being persecuted while awaiting the birth of her Messiah, who came, died, rose again, ascended, and now awaits his future rule over all nations. The woman will however continue to suffer throughout the ages but will be divinely protected, especially during the last part of the Great Tribulation.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> There is no doubt in regard to the identity of the great red dragon who hounds the woman, namely, Satan himself! He will however be eventually defeated and cast out of heaven, never more to persecute either Israel or any single believer!<p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WICKED ONE AND THE LAMB</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Revelation 13 gives us the most descriptive overview of the coming wicked antichrist that can be found in all the Bible.

And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God”</i> (Rev. 19:7-9). <p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WARFARE OF THE LAMB</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh”</i> (Rev. 19:11-21). <p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WONDROUS REIGN OF THE LAMB</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years”</i> (Rev. 20:6).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE WEALTH OF THE LAMB</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">He is the architect, builder, and owner of that shining city among the stars!<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband; And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst; And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. And there</i> <i>shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever”</i> (Rev. 21:1, 2, 9-20; 22:1-5).<p class="spc"></p><p class="dothdg"><span class="dt">●</span><b> THE FINAL WORDS AND WARNING OF THE LAMB</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last; I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star; For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
