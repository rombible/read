He has many crowns, for he is King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is arrayed in a vesture dipped in his own blood, by which he purchased his power as Mediator; and in the blood of his enemies, over whom he always prevails. His name is The Word of God; a name none fully knows but himself; only this we know, that this Word was God manifest in the flesh; but his perfections cannot be fully understood by any creature. Angels and saints follow, and are like Christ in their armour of purity and righteousness. The threatenings of the written word he is going to execute on his enemies. The ensigns of his authority are his name; asserting his authority and power, warning the most powerful princes to submit, or they must fall before him. The powers of earth and hell make their utmost effort. These verses declare important events, foretold by the prophets. These persons were not excused because they did what their leaders bade them. How vain will be the plea of many sinners at the great day! We followed our guides; we did as we saw others do! God has given a rule to walk by, in his word; neither the example of the most, nor of the chief, must influence us contrary thereto: if we do as the most do, we must go where the most go, even into the burning lake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood - Red, as if dipped in blood - emblem of slaughter. The original of this image is probably <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-2.htm">Isaiah 63:2-3</a>. See the notes on that passage.<p>And his name is called The Word of God - The name which in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, it is said that no one knew but he himself.

That is, this is his unique name; a name which belongs only to him, and which distinguishes him from all other beings. The name "Logos," as applicable to the Son of God, and expressive of his nature, is found in the New Testament only in the writings of John, and is used by him to denote the higher or divine nature of the Saviour. In regard to its meaning, and the reason why it is applied to him, see the notes on <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. The reader also may consult, with great advantage, an article by Prof. Stuart in the Bibliotheca Sacra, vol. vii. pp. 16-31. The following may be some of the reasons why it is said <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> that no one understands this but he himself:<p>(1) No one but he can understand its full import, as it implies so high a knowledge of the nature of the Deity;<p>(2) no one but he can understand the relation which it supposes in regard to God, or the relation of the Son to the Father;<p>(3) no one but he can understand what is implied in it, regarded as the method in which God reveals himself to his creatures on earth;<p>(4) no one but he can understand what is implied in it in respect to the manner in which God makes himself known to other worlds.<p>It may be added, as a further illustration of this, that none of the attempts made to explain it have left the matter so that there are no questions unsolved which one would be glad to ask. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. vesture dipped in blood&#8212;Isa 63:2 is alluded to here, and in Re 19:15, end. There the blood is not His own, but that of His foes. So here the blood on His "vesture," reminding us of His own blood shed for even the ungodly who trample on it, is a premonition of the shedding of their blood in righteous retribution. He sheds the blood, not of the godly, as the harlot and beast did, but of the blood-stained ungodly, including them both.<p>The Word of God&#8212;who made the world, is He also who under the same character and attributes shall make it anew. His title, Son of God, is applicable in a lower sense, also to His people; but "the Word of God" indicates His incommunicable Godhead, joined to His manhood, which He shall then manifest in glory. "The Bride does not fear the Bridegroom; her love casteth out fear. She welcomes Him; she cannot be happy but at His side. The Lamb [Re 19:9, the aspect of Christ to His people at His coming] is the symbol of Christ in His gentleness. Who would be afraid of a lamb? Even a little child, instead of being scared, desires to caress it. There is nothing to make us afraid of God but sin, and Jesus is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. What a fearful contrast is the aspect which He will wear towards His enemies! Not as the Bridegroom and the Lamb, but as the [avenging] judge and warrior stained in the blood of His enemies."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; </span> either to denote that he was he who redeemed us by his blood; or rather, to signify that he was now coming forth to shed the blood of his enemies, both in vindication of his own honour and glory, or of his people; in which notion it also agrees with Isaiah’s vision of him, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength?

This is no Logos who dwells among men to give light and life; it is a stern, militant, figure of vengeance attacking the rebellious. Hence his name is mysterious; for “the identity, or at least the close connection between a thing and its name, not only makes the utterance of a holy name an invocation which insures the actual presence of the deity invoked, it also makes the holy name too sacred for common use or even for use at all” (Jevons’ <span class="ital">Introd. Hist. Relig.</span> 361). The passage reflects certain phases of later messianic belief in Judaism, which had been tinged by the Babylonian myth of Marduk, Ea’s victorious son, to whom divine authority was entrusted. Marduk’s triumph was explained by Babylonian theologians as caused by the transference to him of the divine Name (so Michael, En. 69:14). 13<span class="ital">b</span> may be a Johannine gloss upon the unknown name of <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:...">Php 2:9-10</a>), under the influence of passages like <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>, Sap. 18.

If the above explanation of the mysterious name be correct, the author’s idea was evidently forgotten or ignored by some later editor or copyist of the Johannine school, who inserted this gloss in order to clear up the obscure reference, and at the same time to bring forward the transcendent name widely appropriated by that school for Christ in a pacific and religious sense (so nearly all critical editors). In any case the two conceptions of the Apocalypse and the Fourth gospel have little or nothing in common except the word. But the introduction of this apparently illogical sequence between 12 and 13 might be justified in part by <span class="ital">E. B. D.</span> 94, “I am he that cometh forth, advancing, whose name is unknown; I am Yesterday, and Seer of millions of years is my name”. The application of such titles to Jesus certainly gives the impression that these high, honourable predicates are “not yet joined to his person with any intrinsic and essential unity” (Baur); they are rather due to the feeling that “Christ must have a position adequate to the great expectations concerning the last things, of which he is the chief subject”. But their introduction is due to the semi-Christianised messianic conceptions and the divine categories by which the writer is attempting to interpret his experience of Jesus. Backwards and forwards, as pre-existent and future, the redeemer is magnified for the prophet’s consciousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">vesture</span>] Or, <span class="bld">cloak</span>: it is the <span class="ital">outer</span> garment that is so described.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dipt in blood</span>] There is almost equal authority for this reading, “dipped,” or “dyed,” and for “sprinkled.” Either is almost equally supported by the language of <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength?

Probably the similarity of this passage has caused the reading, "sprinkled with blood," which is found in a few manuscripts. In the original passage in Isaiah, the <span class="accented">blood</span> is doubtless the <span class="accented">blood</span> of his enemies; but it is possible that there is here a reference to the blood of Christ himself, which he shed in his warfare with Satan. <span class="cmt_word">And his Name is called The Word of God.</span> Only in St. John's writings does this title appear - a strong argument in favour of his authorship of the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>).

The idea of God which is represented here, underlies the absolute term the Word in <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. It is further urged that in the Gospel &#x3bf;&#788; &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is applied to the prehistoric Christ, while in this passage it is applied to the historic Christ.
