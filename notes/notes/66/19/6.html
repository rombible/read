His true church, his faithful servants, are now about to receive public and peculiar marks of his affection in a state of happiness and dignity suitable to their relation to him. The ancient prophets frequently express the favour of God to his people by the affection of a bridegroom to his spouse. See <a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm" title="For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you: and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="/context/hosea/2-19.htm" title="And I will betroth you to me for ever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies....">Hosea 2:19-20</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm" title="The LORD your God in the middle of you is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over you with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over you with singing.">Zephaniah 3:17</a>. And the Church of Christ in the New Testament is often represented under the same similitude of a bride. See <a href="/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25</a>, &c. And as marriages used to be celebrated with great joy, this is a proper emblem to show the state of prosperity and happiness to which God will raise his church, after all its sufferings for the sake of truth and righteousness. <span class="ital">And his wife hath made herself ready </span>— Even while upon earth, being acquitted from all guilt, purified from all pollution, and adorned with all those graces and virtues which are most excellent in themselves, and most agreeable to him.

Thus St. Paul, (Ephesians 5.,) <span class="ital">Christ gave himself for his church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, and present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Praising God for what we have, is praying for what is yet further to be done for us. There is harmony between the angels and the saints in this triumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. This second union will be completed in heaven; but the beginning of the glorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state of happiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as the celebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, being purified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine, discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publicly owned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; not in the gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but in fine linen, clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed for justification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of the gospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by the Spirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seems to refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will receive in the happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to the angel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true and only object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. This plainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements of bread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship. They stand convicted of idolatry by a messenger from heaven. These are the true sayings of God; of Him who is to be worshipped, as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude - In <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a> he says that he "heard a great voice of much people"; here he says he "heard as it were a voice of a great multitude." That is, in the former case he heard a shout that he at once recognized as the voice of a great multitude of persons; here he says that he heard a sound not distinctly recognized at first as such, but which resembled such a shout of a multitude. In the former case it was distinct; here it was confused - bearing a resemblance to the sound of roaring waters, or to muttering thunder, but less distinct than the former. This phrase would imply:<p>(a) a louder sound; and,<p>(b) that the sound was more remote, and therefore less clear and distinct.<p>And as the voice of many waters - The comparison of the voices of a host of people with the roar of mighty waters is not uncommon in the Scriptures. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>. So in Homer:<p>"The monarch spoke, and straight a murmur rose,<p>Loud as the surges when the tempest blows;<p>That dash'd on broken rocks tumultuous roar,<p>And foam and thunder on the stony shore."<p>And as the voice of mighty thunderings - The loud, deep, heavy voice of thunder. The distant shouts of a multitude may properly be represented by the sound of heavy thunder.<p>Saying, Alleluia - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a>. This is the fourth time in which this is uttered as expressive of the joy of the heavenly hosts in view of the overthrow of the enemies of the church. The occasion will be worthy of this emphatic expression of joy.<p>For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth - Yahweh - God Almighty - the true God. The meaning is, that as the last enemy of the church is destroyed, he now truly reigns. This is the result of his power, and therefore it is proper that he should be praised as the "omnipotent" or "Almighty God" - for he has shown that he can overcome all his enemies, and bring the world to his feet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. many waters&#8212;Contrast the "many waters" on which the whore sitteth (Re 17:1).

Babylon, the harlot, was one great hindrance to His reign being recognized. Her overthrow now clears the way for His advent to reign; therefore, not merely Rome, but the whole of Christendom in so far as it is carnal and compromised Christ for the world, is comprehended in the term "harlot." The beast hardly arises when he at once "goeth into perdition": so that Christ is prophetically considered as already reigning, so soon does His advent follow the judgment on the harlot.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By this <span class="bld">multitude</span> most understand the church.

Even of all the servants of the Lord, and them that fear him, small and great; a vast multitude of converted Jews and Gentiles, in the several parts of the world, who in answer to the voice out of the throne, which came with great power and energy, lift up their voices in praise to God, both for their own conversion, and for the downfall of Babylon: <p>and as the voice of many waters: falling down in a descent, or in rough and rocky places, which make a great noise, and is heard afar off; and such must be the united voice of so great a multitude of converts as will be gathered together everywhere at this time: the same metaphor is used of the voice of Christ in <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a><p>and as the voice of mighty thunderings; violent claps of it, which are sometimes so loud that they rend the very heavens, and strike the inhabitants of the earth with the utmost consternation: these are the same voices which will be heard in the church when the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a><p>saying, Alleluia; or praise ye the Lord; they will call upon one another to celebrate the praises of God, on account of the above things, in the same manner, and using the same word the people in heaven, and the four and twenty elders and four living creatures, do; and this is the fourth time the word is used in this context, and confirms the observation that has been made, that this vision refers to the conversion of the Jews, which will quickly follow the destruction of Rome: and the Jews themselves have a notion, that when Rome is destroyed the Messiah will come; and so he will in his spiritual reign. They say (o), <p>"our redemption will be immediately upon the destruction of Rome.'' <p>And again (p), <p>"the root of our redemption depends upon the destruction of Rome.'' <p>The reason for their saying "hallelujah" follows, <p>for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; by whom is meant the Lord Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all, and God over all, blessed for ever, and is the Almighty; and though he was set up as King over the holy hill of Zion, and has reigned over the church in every age, and came as King into this world, though his kingdom was not of it, and at his resurrection was declared Lord and Christ, and his kingdom was then more manifest, and he has ever since displayed his kingly power in defending his church, and defeating the enemies of it; yet now will he reign more visibly and gloriously, his kingdom will be enlarged from one end of the earth to the other, and he will be King over all the earth, which will occasion great joy to Jews and Gentiles; see <a href="/psalms/47-1.htm">Psalm 47:1</a> and See Gill on <a href="/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>. <p>(o) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 148. 1.((p) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 163. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I heard <span class="cverse3">{6}</span> as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</span><p>(6) Outside the temple in heaven.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/19.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns....">Revelation 19:6-8</a>. The final chorus, which is likewise opened with hallelujah, passing by the judgment in which already the adorable glory of God has been occupied, points forward especially to the marriage of the Lamb, and, therefore, to the revelation of the glory of God, whereby—after all enemies have been judged—believers are to be beatified. Thus, therefore, the point carried to the full end appears in the pause in the Apocalyptic development marked by the ascriptions of praise (<a href="/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a> sqq.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς φωνὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

On the conception <span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλ</span>., cf. <a href="/revelation/11-17.htm" title="Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned.">Revelation 11:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἧλθεν ὁ γάμος του ἀρνίου</span>. As the foundation of the present joy, this is likewise to be understood proleptically, like the <span class="greekheb">ἡλθεν</span>, <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>.[4039] So, correctly, De Wette.[4040] Vitr. is mistaken in his opinion of the state of affairs described, as he even states that the expression <span class="greekheb">ὁ γάμος τοῦ ἀρνίου</span> is synonymous with <span class="greekheb">τὸ δεῖπνον τοῦ γάμου τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρν</span>., in order that both may in the same way[4041] refer to the glorious state of the Church still to be expected within this temporal life. In the directly opposite interest, Züll. reaches the statement that <span class="greekheb">ὁ γάμος τοῦ ἀρνίου</span> is like <span class="greekheb">τὸ δεῖπν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γάμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρν</span>., and that both expressions designate, not the future marriage itself,[4042] but “the preliminary festival of the Messiah’s marriage,” i.e., the one thousand years’ reign.[4043] But the marriage of the Lamb with his bride, i.e., the entire assembly of believers,[4044] is, in fact, nothing else than the distribution of the eternal reward of grace on the part of the coming Lord to his believers, who then enter with Him into the full glory of the heavenly life.[4045] What the final promises of the epistles, chs. 2 and 3, proclaim under various figures with respect to individuals,[4046] is represented as pertaining to the entire Church as the bride of the coming Lord, under the figure of the marriage of the Lamb, and, therefore, as the most intimate and eternally uninterrupted fellowship with Him who has redeemed the Church with his own blood.[4047] An application to individuals follows also in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.">Revelation 19:9</a>. The proleptical (<span class="greekheb">ὴλθεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡτοίμασεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐδόθη</span>) allusion to the blessed fulfilment of the mystery of God,[4048] that has now not yet, in fact, occurred, is here the more suitable in the mouths of the heavenly beings, since, in fact, an act already of the final judgment—viz., the destruction of the great harlot—has been executed, and, consequently, the actual beginning of that fulfilment has been made.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἠ γννὴ αὐτ</span>. The expression is entirely appropriate to the bride,[4049] so that the alteration <span class="greekheb">ἡ νύμφη αὐτ</span>.[4050] appears groundless.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡτοίμασεν ἑαυτήν</span>. As becomes the bride who with joy awaits the coming of her bridegroom.[4051] An important part of her is expressly emphasized in <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a>, in conformity with the figure <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΔΌΘΗ ΑὙΤῇ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, and then interpreted by John, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΓᾺΡ ΒΎΣΣΙΝΟΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΌΘΗ ΑὐΤῆ ἽΝΑ</span></span></span>, cf. <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm" title="And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.">Revelation 6:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΎΣΣ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΛΑΜΠΡῸΝ ΚΑΘΑΡΌΝ</span></span></span>. Excellently, Grot.: “You see here the dignified garb, as that of a matron, not ostentatious, like that of the harlot previously described.” That really distinct references are intended by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΑΜΠΡΌΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΑΡΌΝ</span></span></span>,[4052] is not to be inferred at all events from the interpretation that follows. Cf. also <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14</a>. Meanwhile, it is in itself correct to distinguish the negative innocency of the life from the positive practice of virtue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΔΙΚΑΙΏΜΑΤΑ ΤῶΝ ἉΓΊΩΝ ἘΣΤΊΝ</span></span></span>. Cf. a similar interpretation, <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>. The form of the expression,[4053] and the real parallel,[4054] suggest only <span class="ital">just deeds</span> in which the saints have maintained their fidelity. On the contrary, Ew. ii.: declaration of righteousness; also Meyer, on <a href="/romans/5-16.htm" title="And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.">Romans 5:16</a> : the divine sentence of justification which the saints have received. But the plural form resists this mode of exposition, which, so far as the subject itself is concerned, refers to the writer of the Apocalypse a thought of so peculiarly a Pauline stamp as does not occur elsewhere in the Apoc. Of course, an allusion to the grace bestowed by God, as the ground and source of the <span class="greekheb">δικαιώματα</span> belonging to the saints, is contained in a delicate way in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΌΘΗ ΑὐΤῇ ἽΝΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>; but just this reference to the Divine giving prevents us, on the other hand, from defining the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙὩΜΑΤΑ</span></span></span> as a <span class="ital">Divine</span> activity, but allows us to think only of the just deeds of <span class="ital">saints</span>.[4055] In this result Gebhardt[4056] and Klief. also harmonize.
