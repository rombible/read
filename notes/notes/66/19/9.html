The general and simplest opinion is that it is the angel mentioned in <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a> who speaks. The speaker bids the seer <span class= "ital">write: “</span>Blessed are they who are bidden to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb.” This is one of the six benedictions of the Apocalypse (Rev. <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm" title="Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-6.htm" title="Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.">Revelation 20:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-7.htm" title="Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.">Revelation 22:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a>): it is founded on our Lord’s parables (<a href="/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,">Matthew 22:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>; comp. also <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>): the blessing of the call to the marriage supper is more clearly realised now that the day of joy is at hand. We must not draw too sharp distinctions, as some have done, between the bride and the guests: the imagery is varied to give fulness and force to the truths which no emblems can adequately express. The Church of Christ will rest, and feast, and reign with her Lord; and in all the peace, gladness, and triumph of that joy-time God’s servants will share. A solemn confirmation of this follows, as in <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm" title="And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a> : “these words are true (sayings) of God.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God....">Revelation 19:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he </span>(the angel) <span class="ital">saith unto me, Write </span>— Record this as an important truth, in which all that read this book in future ages will be greatly concerned; <span class="ital">Blessed </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μακαριοι</span>, <span class="ital">happy; are they which are called unto the marriage-supper of the Lamb </span>— Who shall be living at this time, and shall obey the invitation to this marriage-feast, and partake of all the privileges and blessings belonging to it. <span class="ital">And he saith unto me, </span>after a little pause, <span class="ital">These are the true sayings of God </span>— They are to be regarded by thee, and all that read them, as declarations infallibly true, and infinitely momentous. <span class="ital">And — </span>While he was speaking to me in this kind and condescending manner, being overawed by his majestic appearance, and in such a rapture and ecstasy at these discoveries that I knew not, or did not consider, what I did; <span class="ital">I fell at his feet </span>— Prostrated myself before him; <span class="ital">to worship him </span>— Or to do him homage, as though I had owed all these discoveries to him. <span class="ital">And he said, See thou do it not — </span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">ωρα μη</span>, <span class="ital">See not, </span>with a beautiful abruptness. It does not appear that St. John intended to pay religious worship to this angel; for he could not but know that he was only a creature, and that religiously to worship any creature, however exalted, would be flat idolatry. He seems only to have intended such civil respect and reverence as the Asiatics were wont to pay to superiors, and especially to persons in high rank; which indeed is frequently all that is meant by the word <span class="greekheb">προσκυνεω</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">to worship. </span>Thus Ruth complimented Boaz with this kind of honour, when <span class="ital">she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, </span><a href="/ruth/2-10.htm" title="Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in your eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?">Ruth 2:10</a>. Thus Abigail also showed her respect for David: <span class="ital">she fell before him on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, </span><a href="/1_samuel/25-23.htm" title="And when Abigail saw David, she hurried, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,">1 Samuel 25:23</a>. Indeed, the reason for which the angel forbids this high act of respect, seems to intimate that he did not understand it as an act of religious honour, for he mentions nothing concerning the sin or danger of idolatry, as implied in it: he only shows that it was improper the apostle should pay such respect to him, which he does, not by showing that it was unlawful to give such respect to any created being whatsoever, but because he was only a fellow-servant with the apostle, and a servant of his brethren, that had the testimony of Jesus. As if he had said, I am now employed as your fellow-servant, to testify of the Lord Jesus by the same Spirit which inspired the prophets of old. <span class="ital">Worship God </span>— Pay thine homage, in such expressions of it, to God alone, to whom alone thou owest these revelations. <span class="ital">The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy </span>— That is, the spirit of prophecy serves, in a glorious manner, to confirm Jesus’s divine mission, to all that know and duly observe the circumstances of it; and that which I now reveal to thee makes a considerable article of the proof: or, this ability of foretelling things to come is an argument or evidence of Christ’s speaking in and by me, as he does by thee.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Praising God for what we have, is praying for what is yet further to be done for us. There is harmony between the angels and the saints in this triumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. This second union will be completed in heaven; but the beginning of the glorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state of happiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as the celebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, being purified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine, discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publicly owned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; not in the gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but in fine linen, clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed for justification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of the gospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by the Spirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seems to refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will receive in the happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to the angel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true and only object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. This plainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements of bread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship. They stand convicted of idolatry by a messenger from heaven. These are the true sayings of God; of Him who is to be worshipped, as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he saith unto me - The angel who made these representations to him.

The importance of what is here said; the desirableness of having it fixed in the mind, amidst the trials of life and the scenes of persecution through which the church was to pass, makes this solemn declaration proper. The idea is, that in all times of persecution - in every dark hour of despondency - the church, as such, and every individual member of the church, should receive it as a solemn truth never to be doubted, that the religion of Christ would finally prevail, and that all persecution and sorrow here would be followed by joy and triumph in heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The significance of the short interlude lies in what the angel says to John (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.">Revelation 19:9</a>), by applying in express exhortation,[4057] the reference contained already in the ascription of praise of the heavenly beings, to the goal of all the hopes of believers, and emphatically confirming the consolatory certainty of the hope thus set before believers, by the assurance that this word of God is true. Also to the prophetical declaration of this glorious hope by John, an attestation is given in <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>, which must confirm believers[4058] receiving the testimony of the prophet in the hope and patience upon which their victory depends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λέγει-g0- μοι-g0-</span>. The one speaking is, at all events, according to <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>, an angel; but not “an interpreting angel,” such as Ewald and Ebrard think was the constant attendant of John,[4059] but the angel who from <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a> on serves John as the communicator of the revelation.[4060] To this points also the immediately succeeding declaration of the same angel (<span class="greekheb">οὖτοι οἱ λόγοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Γράψον μακάριοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.). Cf. <a href="/revelation/14-3.htm" title="And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.">Revelation 14:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ δεῖπνον τοῦ γάμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρν</span>. In a still more concrete way than <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7</a> (<span class="greekheb">ὁ γάμος τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρν</span>.) is the final blessed communion with the Lord illustrated. Moreover the paracletic pertinence of the discourse brings with it also the fact that it is not the idea of the Church as the bride of the Lamb, but that of individual believers as wedding guests, which enters here.[4061] By the repetition of the formula <span class="greekheb">καὶ λέγει μοι</span>, the succeeding speech of the angel is especially separated from his preceding words, and thus receives a peculiar importance. If we suppose that the art. is to be read before <span class="greekheb">ἀληθινοὶ</span>,[4062]—which certainly does not serve to facilitate the construction,[4063]—we must translate with Beng., Ebrard, Bleek, and Ew. ii.: “These are the true words of God.” The ingenious explanation of Hengstenb. (“These words are true, they are words of God”), even apart from the art. before <span class="greekheb">ἀληθ</span>., is refuted by the fact that the <span class="greekheb">εἰσίν</span>, in any case, belongs not before, but after, the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span>. De Wette, who translates: “These words are the true (words) of God,”[4064] appeals, in opposition to Beng., to the parallel, <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm" title="And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.">Revelation 21:5</a>. But there the construction of the sentence is extremely simple, since to the subj. <span class="greekheb">οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι</span> the definition of the predicate is added, <span class="greekheb">πιστοὶ καὶ ἀληθινοί εἰσιν</span>; but here not only the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, but especially the art. before <span class="greekheb">ἀληθ</span>., effects another relation in the entire statement. By means of this art., it becomes far simpler to bring together <span class="greekheb">οἱ λόγοι οἱ ἀληθινοὶ</span>, and to understand these words combined with <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span> as a predicate to the subject <span class="greekheb">οὖτοι</span>.[4065] But the sense is by no means that which Bengel’s explanation suggests to De Wette,[4066] but after the angel has afforded John the revelation of the judgment upon the harlot, and, from this beginning of the final judgment, has given an intimation concerning the blessed mystery of God, which lies back of the entire judgment, he reviews all the words of revelation, of which he had served as the interpreter to the prophet from <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a> on. These, he says, are the true, i.e., the genuine and right, words of God. The <span class="greekheb">ἀληθινοί</span> here mentions not the truth or the correctness of the contents, but the reality of the correlated statement: <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span>. This explanation is afforded, on the one hand, by the plural <span class="greekheb">οἱ λόγοι</span> alone,—which Hengstenb., as well as Klief., refers to 5–8, Ebrard to 6–8 and 9, but the most do not take into further consideration,—and, on the other hand, also by what is reported in <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>. Ebrard was on the right track when he alluded to the expression <span class="greekheb">οἱ λόγοι τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, <a href="/revelation/17-17.htm" title="For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.">Revelation 17:17</a>; but he wanders from it again, when, just as he understands those <span class="greekheb">λόγοι τοῦ θεοῦ</span> as promises concerning the final redemption of the Church, so, in this passage, he limits the <span class="greekheb">λόγοι οἱ ἀληθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θ</span>. to <a href="/context/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns....">Revelation 19:6-9</a>. The latter is not entirely correct; for there is no reason for excluding the songs of <a href="/context/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:...">Revelation 19:1-5</a>, which also refer to the goal presented in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.">Revelation 19:9</a>, in a manner precisely identical with <a href="/context/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns....">Revelation 19:6-8</a>. But what is said from <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a> on, concerning the now-impending glorification of the Church, has to do with but one side of the subject, with only one part of the <span class="greekheb">λόγοι τοῦ θεοῦ</span> (<a href="/revelation/17-17.htm" title="For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.">Revelation 17:17</a>), or of the mystery of God, announced by the ancient prophets.[4067] This one point is made prominent also in the songs from <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a> on, only upon the ground of the judgment lying before the same, which is now already fulfilled in an act. As now (<a href="/revelation/17-17.htm" title="For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.">Revelation 17:17</a>) the <span class="greekheb">λόγοι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span> contain both, viz., the proclamation of the Divine judgment against every thing antichristian,—the kings of the world, with the beast of the world, are to rule only until the words of God, which proclaim the destruction of these same powers, shall find their fulfilment, i.e., until the dominion of those antichristian powers shall be annihilated according to God’s declaration,—and the promise; the <span class="greekheb">λόγοι οἱ ἀληθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θ</span>., in this passage, refer to all the revelations which the prophet has received, as the fulfilment of the promise (<a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>) of the angel even now also speaking with him (<span class="greekheb">δεἰξω σοι τὸ κρίμα τῆς πόρνης τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μεγ</span>.), i.e., they refer to <a href="/revelation/18-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.">Revelation 18:1</a> to <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.">Revelation 19:9</a>. By the expression <span class="greekheb">οὐτοι οἱ λόγοι οἱ ἀληθ</span>., a review is made of that entire section—in which the expressions referring to the glorification of believers, <a href="/context/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:...">Revelation 19:1-9</a>, are represented in most immediate combination with judgment upon the antichristian powers already fulfilled in one act—in a way precisely analogous to that of <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a>, where, at the conclusion of the entire revelation, a confirmatory reference is made to all that was disclosed to the gazing prophet, from <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a> on, as about to happen. But in this passage, also, such a conclusion is entirely justified, because here an important part of what was to happen had already happened, viz., the judgment upon the great harlot; and therewith the fulfilment of the words,[4068] or of the mystery,[4069] of God, had already begun. Now also there is given to the prophet the direct pledge of the certainty of what he has beheld; that these words which he has received are the actual and true words of God himself. From this the explanation follows as to why it is that John (<a href="/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>)[4070] falls down before the angel in order “to worship” him. Ebrard is wrong in his attempt to attach a prophetic significance to this occurrence; viz., that the children of God are to be warned against the temptation of worshipping angels, “who have brought about the victory over antichrist.” The last is here entirely foreign. Grot., Vitr., Beng., etc., recognize in the adoring prostration an excessive token of gratitude, and therefore forbidden also by the angel.[4071] De Wette, in accordance with his exposition of 9<span class="ital">b</span>, finds here an expression of joyful astonishment at prophecies so confirmed (?). But partly from what precedes (<span class="greekheb">λόγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀληθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span>), and partly from the manner in which the angel rejects the adoration as not due him, as a fellow-servant of John, it may be first of all inferred that John regarded the angel thus addressing him, not as a fellow-servant, but as the Lord himself.[4072] At first,[4073] John had a proper estimate of the angel; but just by what was said (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.">Revelation 19:9</a><span class="ital"> b</span>), John could attain the supposition that the Lord himself spoke to him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅρα μη</span>. The aposiopesis[4074] is self-evident from what precedes: “See that thou dost it not!” Ay, do it not!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σύνδουλος</span>. Because the angel serves the same Lord[4075] as John and all his brethren, “who have the testimony of Jesus,” i.e., all believers.[4076] The Lord is God;[4077] to him, therefore, belongs the adoration which John intended to offer to the angel (<span class="greekheb">τῷ θεῷ προσκύνησον</span>). The entire repulse by the angel does not therefore sound “as tender as possible, almost having the tone of intercession,”[4078] but is throughout decided.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The closing words of <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a> belong not to the address of the angel, but are a remark of John, whereby he establishes and explains (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>) what has just been said by the angel. It is incorrect to explain the gen. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span> as subjective, “the testimony proceeding from Jesus;”[4079] for if, on the one hand, reference to the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐχόντων τὴν μαρτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span> require this explanation,[4080] on the other hand the declaration is intelligible only by defining the <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρία τοῦ Ἰησ</span>. as <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνευμα τῆς προφητείας</span>. This cannot mean: “He who confesses Christ as thou dost has also the spirit of prophecy,”[4081] but designates, in the sense of <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>, and in thorough agreement with what is indicated in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.">Revelation 22:16</a>, concerning the nature and the origin of prophecy, that Christ, by himself imparting his testimony of revelation to a man, fills him[4082] with the spirit of prophecy,—who now speaks from and through the prophets.[4083] As Christ, the coming One, is the goal of all Christian prophecy,[4084] so is He also its author. From the closing words of the verse, it might be inferred,[4085] that “they who have the testimony of Jesus” are not believers in general, but only the prophets, so that the angel would call himself a fellow-servant only of the prophets; as Hengstenb. also (<a href="/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a>) understands by the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΟΎΛΟΙς ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span> only prophets. But as (<a href="/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a>), on the contrary, the servants of God[4086] are distinguished from the prophets, and considered as the believers for whose instruction the prophets receive their revelations,[4087] so also in this passage.[4088] Believers do not have the testimony proceeding from Jesus without the service of the prophets, as John himself is one; but they are prophets because of the testimony communicated to them by the Lord, which testimony in them is the spirit of prophecy. Thus there is in <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a><span class="ital"> b</span> an attestation to the prophetical book of John, similar to that which was emphatically maintained in the beginning[4089] and at the close.[4090] [Note LXXXV., p. 461.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4057] Cf. <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4058] Cf. <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm" title="Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 1:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm" title="For I testify to every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:">Revelation 22:18</a> sqq.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4059] Cf. <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4060] Beng., Züll., De Wette, Hengstenb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4061] Cf. <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,">Matthew 22:1</a> sqq., <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/revelation/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/revelation/19-9.htm" title="And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

Like the Greek <span class="greekheb">πόλις</span>, the church is composed of members who are ideally distinguishable from her, just as in En. xxxviii. 1 the congregation of the righteous is equivalent to the new Jerusalem.

It is a common reiteration in apocc. (<span class="ital">cf.</span> reff.), underlining as it were the solemn statements of a given passage. See, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Herm. <span class="ital">Vis.</span> iii. 4, “that God’s name may be glorified, hath this been revealed to thee, for the sake of those who are of doubtful mind, questioning in their hearts whether this is so or not. Tell them it is all true, that there is nothing but truth in it, that all is sure and valid and founded”. In Sanhed. Jerus. Rabbi Jochanan declares, with reference to <a href="/daniel/10-1.htm" title="In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.">Daniel 10:1</a>, that a true word is one which has been already revealed by God to the council of the heavenly host.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">And he saith</span>] Who speaks?

Cf. the command in <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a> and Revelation 21:5, and the prohibition in Revelation 10:4; cf. also the expression in <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, "Blessed are the dead," etc. It almost seems as if the writer has in his mind the connection of ideas indicated by the words quoted above on ver. 8, "Their works do follow them." The figure of the "marriage supper" is rather a new symbol than the continuation of the symbol of the bride; though very probably suggested by it. For those who partake of the "marriage supper" are those who constitute the bride, viz. the faithful Church of God. Cf. <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, the words which are spoken by the "Amen, the faithful and true Witness" (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>): "If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."
