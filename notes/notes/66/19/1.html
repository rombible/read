The song is as follows:—<p>Alleluia!<p>The salvation, and the glory, and the power<p>Are our God’s,<p>Because true and righteous are His judgments,<p>Because He judged the great harlot, who corrupted the<p>earth in her fornication,<p>And avenged the blood of His servants out of her hand,<p>Alleluia.<p>This last “Alleluia” clearly belongs to the song or chorus. It is separated from the body of it by the descriptive words (<a href="/revelation/19-3.htm" title="And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.">Revelation 19:3</a>), <span class= "ital">And again they said, Alleluia;</span> or better, <span class= "ital">and a second time they have said.</span> The Evangelist, as he writes, seems to hear once more the strains of the anthem: he writes down the words. and, as the final “Alleluia” bursts forth after a musical pause, he writes, “once more they have said Alleluia.” The word Alleluia occurs in this passage no less than four times (<a href="/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/19-3.htm" title="And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.">Revelation 19:3-4</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns.">Revelation 19:6</a>): it is nowhere else used in the New Testament; but it is familiar to us in the Psalms, as fifteen of them begin or end with “Praise ye the Lord,” or “Hallelujah;” and the genius of Handel has enshrined the word in imperishable music. The song here does not begin with ascribing “salvation, &c.,” to God, as the English version suggests: it rather affirms the fact: the salvation, &c., is God’s. It is the echo of the ancient utterance—“Salvation belongeth unto God.” It is the triumphant affirmation of the truth by which the Church and children of God had sustained their struggling petitions, as they closed the prayer which Christ Himself had taught them, saying, when too often it seemed to be otherwise, “Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.” So here they give a threefold praise: the salvation, and the glory, and the power are all God’s. The manifestation of His power is in the deliverance of His children from the evil, from the great harlot, and in the avenging the blood of His servants out of her hand, “forcing, as it were, out of her hand the price of their blood.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:...">Revelation 19:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">And after these things </span>— After this affecting representation of the certain destruction of Babylon, as the seat of the antichristian kingdom; <span class="ital">I heard a great voice of much people in heaven </span>— A great chorus, who, with united voices, began to praise God on the occasion, <span class="ital">saying, Alleluia</span> — That is, <span class="ital">Praise ye Jehovah, </span>or, <span class="ital">He that is, and was, and is to come; </span>a title which, of all others, is the most peculiar to the everlasting God. <span class="ital">Salvation, glory, honour, and power </span>be ascribed <span class="ital">unto the Lord our God </span>— To whom only they belong. The <span class="ital">salvation </span>spoken of is opposed to the destruction which the great whore had brought upon the earth: his <span class="ital">power and his glory </span>appear from the judgment executed on her, and from the setting up of his kingdom to endure through all ages. <span class="ital">For true and righteous are his judgments </span>— His judgments show him to be righteous, true, and faithful; <span class="ital">for he hath judged the great whore </span>— His punishment of mystical Babylon, for her pride, superstition, and idolatry, declares his righteousness; and his truth and faithfulness to his promises are illustriously manifested in his avenging the blood of his servants on her, who so cruelly put them to death for their faith in his word and constancy in his religion. <span class="ital">And again they said, Alleluia </span>— With their hearts inflamed with gratitude and joy. <span class="ital">And her smoke rose up </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αναβαινει</span>, <span class="ital">rises up, </span>for they seem to be the words of the same heavenly chorus which praised in the preceding language. As if they had said, Let our God be glorified, who in this last judgment hath put an end to this persecuting power for ever. It shall not henceforth, as formerly, rise up again to afflict his saints. This city shall lie waste from generation to generation, never to be restored. Mr. Daubuz observes: “The two alleluias in this part of the hymn correspond to the messages of the two angels, one of which proclaims the fall of Babylon, and the other shows its destruction to be perpetual.” The expression, <span class="ital">her smoke rose up, </span>&c., intimated that Rome should be made as signal a monument of divine vengeance as Sodom and Gomorrah had been. It is taken from <a href="/context/isaiah/34-9.htm" title="And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch....">Isaiah 34:9-10</a>, where by <span class="ital">Edom </span>the Jews understand Rome; and in the genuine editions of the Chaldee paraphrase it is, <span class="ital">And the rivers of Rome shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch: — it shall not be quenched night nor day: the smoke shall go up for ever. </span>And this tradition of the rabbins may receive some confirmation from this verse. Indeed, such an event must appear the more probable, when we consider that the adjacent countries are known to be of a sulphurous and bituminous soil: and that even at Rome there have been eruptions of subterraneous fire, which have consumed several buildings, according to Dion, (lib. 66.,) on one occasion, even a considerable part of Rome; so that the fuel seems to be prepared, and to wait only for the breath of the Lord to kindle it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Praising God for what we have, is praying for what is yet further to be done for us. There is harmony between the angels and the saints in this triumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. This second union will be completed in heaven; but the beginning of the glorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state of happiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as the celebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, being purified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine, discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publicly owned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; not in the gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but in fine linen, clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed for justification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of the gospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by the Spirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seems to refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will receive in the happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to the angel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true and only object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. This plainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements of bread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship. They stand convicted of idolatry by a messenger from heaven. These are the true sayings of God; of Him who is to be worshipped, as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And after these things - The things particularly that were exhibited in the previous chapter.

The occasion on which it is introduced here is very appropriate. It is uttered by the inhabitants of heaven, in the immediate presence of God himself, and in view of the final overthrow of the enemies of the church, and the triumph of the gospel. In such circumstances it was fit that heaven should render praise, and that a song of thanksgiving should be uttered in which all holy beings could unite.<p>Salvation - That is, the salvation is to be ascribed to God.

As in the case of the opening of the prophecy, Re 4:8; 5:9, &c.; so now, at one of the great closing events seen in vision, the judgment on the harlot (described in Re 18:1-24), there is a song of praise in heaven to God: compare Re 7:10, &c., toward the close of the seals, and Re 11:15-18, at the close of the trumpets: Re 15:3, at the saints' victory over the beast.<p>And&#8212;so Andreas.

The great manifestation of God's power in destroying Babylon calls forth a great voice of praise in heaven.<p>people&#8212;Greek, "multitude."<p>Alleluia&#8212;Hebrew, "Praise ye Jah," or Jehovah: here first used in Revelation, whence Ellicott infers the Jews bear a prominent part in this thanksgiving. Jah is not a contraction of "Jehovah," as it sometimes occurs jointly with the latter. It means "He who Is": whereas Jehovah is "He who will be, is, and was." It implies God experienced as a PRESENT help; so that "Hallelujah," says Kimchi in Bengel, is found first in the Psalms on the destruction of the ungodly. "Hallelu-Jah" occurs four times in this passage. Compare Ps 149:4-9, which is plainly parallel, and indeed identical in many of the phrases, as well as the general idea. Israel, especially, will join in the Hallelujah, when "her warfare is accomplished" and her foe destroyed.<p>Salvation, &c.&#8212;Greek, "The salvation &#8230; the glory &#8230; the power."<p>and honour&#8212;so Coptic.

After the angel had declared the fall of Babylon, a voice from heaven had called the people of God out of her, and had ordered them to take vengeance on her; after the mournful lamentation of the kings, merchants, and seafaring men; after another voice had called upon the saints to rejoice at her overthrow, and a mighty angel had described the manner of it, and had expressed her ruin in the strongest terms, with the reasons of it, John heard the songs of the righteous, as follow: <p>I heard a great voice of much people in heaven: not literally taken, for these are not the innumerable company of angels, who are never called people; nor the spirits of just men made perfect, or the souls of departed saints, but men on earth; wherefore heaven designs the church, as in <a href="/revelation/18-20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a> and frequently in this book; the people are the same with the 144000 seen with the Lamb on Mount Zion, <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a> and with those on the sea of glass, who had got the victory over the beast, <a href="/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2</a> and are no other than God's covenant people, who are given to Christ, and made willing to be his in the day of his power; and though they are but a seed, a remnant, a small company, when compared with the world and carnal professors; yet are a large body of themselves, especially they will be at this time, when the nation of the Jews shall be born at once, and the fulness of the Gentiles will be brought in: and their voice on this occasion, the downfall of Rome, is said to be "great" partly on account of their number, who will join together in acclamations of praise, and partly on account of their great affection and vehemency of spirit, which will be raised hereby: <p>saying Alleluia; an Hebrew word, which signifies "praise ye the Lord". The Jews say (n), that the book of Psalms consists of ten sorts of songs, but Hallelujah is the greatest of them, because it comprehends the name (Jehovah) and praise in one word: and it is observable that this word, which is often used in the Psalms, is first used when the Psalmist desires the utter consumption and destruction of sinners and wicked men on earth, and is here taken up by the saints at the destruction of the man of sin and son of perdition; see <a href="/psalms/104-35.htm">Psalm 104:35</a> and its being an Hebrew word shows that at this time the Jews will be converted, and that Jews and Gentiles will become one church state, and will worship and praise the Lord together; for the word is a call upon the saints to join together in solemn praise and thanksgiving; who is to be praised for the perfections of his nature, for the works of his hands, both of nature and grace; and for his righteous judgments on his and his church's enemies; and this is to be done in concert: <p>salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: salvation, temporal, spiritual, and eternal, is of God; "salvation" from antichristian power and tyranny, and from all enemies, and the everlasting salvation of the soul; and the "glory" of it belongs to all the three Persons; they are glorious in themselves, and deserve all glory to be ascribed to them by man, and especially by the saints: "honour" is also their due; God the Father is to be honoured because he is the Father, and the Son is to he honoured as the Father is, and the Holy Spirit is not to be grieved, but to be highly esteemed and valued, and equally with the other two Persons: and "power" belongs to them all, and is seen in the works of creation, redemption, and sanctification. <p>(n) Yalkut Simeoni, par. 2. fol. 89. 1.

I obtrude this analysis upon the attention of no one: no one, however, will readily deny, that He, <span class="ital">Who is</span>, is called <span class="greekheb">יָהּ</span>; and that remains firm, even though you should derive it with Hiller from <span class="greekheb">יהי</span>, the future; for the phrase, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, has already before been given for the pause (close of the formula): see above on ch. <a href="/revelation/11-17.htm" title="Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned.">Revelation 11:17</a>. In the three clauses, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ὢ καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, the times had to be accurately distinguished; but when the <span class="greekheb">יָהּ </span>is found separately, the derivation from <span class="greekheb">יהי </span>does not remove the force of present time, as is seen in so many proper names of men. The LXX. use the name, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν</span>, <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm" title="And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.">Exodus 3:14</a>, and (where there was less occasion for it) <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm" title="Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.">Jeremiah 1:5</a> (6), <a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm" title="Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.">Jeremiah 14:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm" title="Ah Lord GOD! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you:">Jeremiah 32:17</a> : and <span class="greekheb">יָהּ </span>itself has the same meaning as <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν</span>, Euthymius explaining it in Fuller, Miscell. pp. 486, 487. Add Drusius on this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>§ 7. That the name <span class="greekheb">יָהּ </span>is not curtailed from the name <span class="greekheb">יְהֹוָה</span>, is evident from this, that <span class="greekheb">יְהֹוָה </span>is used much more frequently than <span class="greekheb">יָהּ</span>, and that it is quoted sometimes jointly <span class="greekheb">יָהּ יְהֹוָה</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>§ 8. As God commanded by Moses that He should be called <span class="greekheb">יְהֹוָהּ</span>, immediately upon the very coming out of Egypt, the name <span class="greekheb">יָהּ </span>was also introduced in the Song of Moses, <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.">Exodus 15:2</a>, in these words: <span class="greekheb">עזי וזמרת יה ויהי לי לישועה</span>, where, from a most present feeling of that most saving Divine work, the Lord is called <span class="greekheb">יָהּ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὤν</span>. Hence this name is quoted only in Songs. Isaiah is in harmony with the Song of Moses, introducing the people thus speaking: <span class="greekheb">כי עזי וזמרת יה יהוה ויהי לי לישועה</span>, ch. <a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm" title="Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.">Isaiah 12:2</a>. The same has <span class="greekheb">בטחו ביהוה עדי עד כי ביה יהוה צור עולמים</span>, ch. <a href="/isaiah/26-4.htm" title="Trust you in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:">Isaiah 26:4</a>. But in both passages Isaiah at the same time exhorts to trust in God for the future, and on this account he calls the Lord <span class="greekheb">יהוה </span>and <span class="greekheb">יה יהוה</span>, and by this very circumstance he teaches us the difference between the two names.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>§ 9. God is called <span class="greekheb">יה</span>, because He is; He is called <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span>, because He will be, and Is and Was: He is called <span class="greekheb">יה יהוה</span>, because, for instance, in the Song of Isaiah He is celebrated, as He has shown Himself a present God in the very act itself, and at the same time He is with all confidence declared as about to show Himself (similarly) for the future. The name, <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span>, was frequently used in the times of promises drawing towards their accomplishment: <span class="greekheb">יה </span>is adapted to all times which are gladdened with present aid, and therefore especially to the last times. Thus the consideration of time future, and also of former time (<a href="/jeremiah/23-7.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 23:7</a>), coalesces with the present: and He who was before called <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, is at length called <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὤν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>§ 10. <span class="ital">Hallelujah</span> therefore is again and again suitable to this song, Revelation 19, and in it the name <span class="greekheb">יָהּ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν</span>, Being.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>§ 11. The observation which is found in Kimchi is everywhere quoted, that <span class="ital">Hallelujah</span> resounds, in the place where it first occurs in the Psalms, upon the destruction <span class="ital">of sinners and the ungodly:</span> <a href="/psalms/104-35.htm" title="Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.

The "great voice," as usual, characteristic of the heavenly utterances (see <a href="/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>, etc.). Again, we are not told whose the utterance is. It may well be that of all the heavenly inhabitants and saints in glory (cf <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). As usual in the Apocalypse, at the termination of a description of the last judgment comes the triumphant song of the heavenly host (cf <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-17</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>).
