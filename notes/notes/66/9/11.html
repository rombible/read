his name</span> (is) <span class= "ital">in Hebrew Abaddon, and in the Greek he has a name</span>, <span class= "ital">Apollyon. </span>There is more than one point in which the seer wishes us to mark the contrast between these symbolical and the natural locusts. Locusts have no sting; these have. Locusts have no king (<a href="/proverbs/30-27.htm" title="The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;">Proverbs 30:27</a>); these have a king. The movements of the invading locusts are conducted with wonderful precision and order, yet no presiding monarch arranges their march; but here there is a directing and controlling head. The great movement is no mere undesigned or instinctive one, but the offspring of a hidden, spiritual force. The great battle is not on the surface only, the invasions, revolutions, tyrannies, which try and trouble mankind, involve spiritual principles, and are but tokens of the great conflict between the spirit of destruction and the spirit of salvation, between Christ and Belial, God and Mammon, the Prince of this world and the Prince of the kings of the earth. The king of these locust hordes is named in Hebrew Abaddon, or Perdition, a name sometimes given to the place or abode of destruction (<a href="/job/26-6.htm" title="Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.">Job 26:6</a>). “Destruction (Abaddon) hath no covering”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> before God. (Comp. <a href="/proverbs/15-11.htm" title="Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?">Proverbs 15:11</a>). In Greek his name is Apollyon, or Destroyer: The spirit of the destroyer is the spirit that inspires these hosts. It is a great movement, but its end is destruction, as its inspiring genius is from beneath, from an angel of the nether world. It is not necessary for us to seek some great historical personage for the fulfilment of this portion of the prophecy, any more than we ought to accept any great historical event as an exhaustive fulfilment of the vision. The picture is vivid and forcible, and its full and certain meaning will be plain hereafter; but it at least should draw our minds from the curiosity which seeks for historical or personal counterparts to the self-vigilance which fears lest our own spirit should be injured by the prevalence of any form of evil. It should teach us to remember always the vehement, earnest way in which the sacred writers describe the subtle, venomous power of all sin, and the merciless destructiveness of its work. It is not of any invading hosts, or signal and special forms of evil, but of the terrible and usual influence of all sin, that the Apostle St. Paul writes when he describes the world-wide devastations of sin in language partly borrowed from the Old Testament, but singularly reminding us of the vision before us. “There is none that doeth good; no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; the poison of asps is upon their lips; their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace have they not known; there is no fear of God before their eyes” (<a href="/context/romans/3-12.htm" title="They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.">Romans 3:12-18</a>). It is perhaps well to notice that at this fifth trumpet the unseen spiritual powers of darkness appear taking part in. the conflict. There is a time when the obstinate resistance of mankind (yes, and of individual men and women also) to better things becomes fortified by an evil spirit, and they are no longer passive resisters of good, but they become active antagonists of good, hating and obscuring the light of truth, and wounding the spirits and consciences of men. Alas! many walk of whom the Apostle could only say with tears, “they are the enemies of the cross of Christ” (the emblem of salvation), “and whose end is destruction” (<a href="/context/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Philippians 3:18-19</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-12 Upon sounding the fifth trumpet, a star fell from heaven to the earth. Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and infection in the soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they had a king over them -  A ruler who marshalled their hosts. Locusts often, and indeed generally, move in bands, though they do not appear to be under the direction of anyone as a particular ruler or guide. In this case it struck John as a remarkable peculiarity that they had a king - a king who, it would seem, had the absolute control, and to whom was to be traced all the destruction which would ensue from their emerging from the bottomless pit.<p>Which is the angel of the bottomless pit - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>. The word "angel" here would seem to refer to the chief of the evil angels, who presided over the dark and gloomy regions from whence the locusts seemed to emerge. This may either mean that this evil angel seemed to command them personally, or that his spirit was infused into the leader of these hosts.<p>Whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon - The name Abaddon means literally "destruction," and is the same as Apollyon.<p>But in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon - From &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  apollumi - "to destroy." The word properly denotes "a destroyer," and the name is given to this king of the hosts, represented by the locusts, because this would be his principal characteristic.<p>After this minute explanation of the literal meaning of the symbol, it may be useful, before attempting to apply it, and to ascertain the events designed to be represented, to have a distinct impression of the principal image - the locust. It is evident that this is, in many respects, a creature of the imagination, and that we are not to expect the exact representation to be found in any forms of actual existence in the animal creation. The following engraving, prepared by Mr. Elliott (vol. i. p. 410), will give a sufficiently accurate representation of this symbolical figure as it appeared to John.<p>The question now is, whether any events occurred in history, subsequent to and succeeding those supposed to be referred to in the fourth trumpet, to which this symbol would be applicable. Reasons have already been suggested for supposing that there was a transfer of the seat of the operations to another part of the world. The first four trumpets referred to a continual series of events of the same general character, and having a proper close. These have been explained as referring to the successive shocks which terminated in the downfall of the Western empire. At the close of that series there is a pause in the representation <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a>, and a solemn proclamation that other scenes were to open distinguished for woe. These were to be symbolized in the sounding of the remaining three trumpets, embracing the whole period until the consummation of all things - or sketching great and momentous events in the future, until the volume sealed with the seven seals <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a> should have been wholly unrolled and its contents disclosed. The whole scene now is changed. Rome has fallen. It has passed into the hands of strangers. The power that had spread itself over the world has, in that form, come to an end, and is to exist no more - though, as we shall see (<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>ff), another power, quite as formidable, existing there, is to be described by a new set of symbols. But here <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9</a> a new power appears. The scenery is all Oriental, and clearly has reference to events that were to spring up in the East. With surprising unanimity, commentators have agreed in regarding this as referring to the empire of the Saracens, or to the rise and progress of the religion and the empire set up by Muhammed. The inquiry now is, whether the circumstances introduced into the symbol find a proper fulfillment in the rise of the Saracenic power, and in the conquests of the Prophet of Mecca:<p>(1) "The country where the scene is laid." As already remarked the scene is Oriental - for the mention of locusts naturally suggests the East - that being the part of the world where they abound, and they being in fact especially an Oriental plague. It may now be added, that in a more strict and proper sense Arabia may be intended; that is, if it be admitted that the design was to symbolize events pertaining to Arabia, or the gathering of the hosts of Arabia for conquest, the symbol of locusts would have been employed for the locust, the groundwork of the symbol is especially Arabic. It was the east wind which brought the locusts on Egypt <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>, and they must therefore have come from some portion of Arabia - for Arabia is the land that lies over against Egypt in the east. Such, too, is the testimony of Volney; "the most judicious," as Mr. Gibbon calls him, "of modern travelers." "The inhabitants of Syria," says he, "have remarked that locusts come constantly from the desert of Arabia," ch. 20:sect. 5.<p>All that is necessary to say further on this point is, that on the supposition that it was the design of the Spirit of inspiration in the passage before us to refer to the followers of Muhammed, the image of the locusts was that which would be naturally selected. There was no other one so appropriate and so striking; no one that would so naturally designate the country of Arabia. As some confirmation of this, or as showing how natural the symbol would be, a remark may be introduced from Mr. Forster. In his Mohammedanism Unveiled, vol. i. p. 217, he says, "In the Bedoween romance of Antar, the locust is introduced as the national emblem of the Ishmaelites. And it is a remarkable coincidence that Muslim tradition speaks of locusts having dropped into the hands of Muhammed, bearing on their wings this inscription - 'We are the army of the Great God.'" These circumstances will show the propriety of the symbol on the supposition that it refers to Arabia and the Saracens.<p>(2) the people. The question is, whether there was anything in the symbol, as described by John, which would properly designate the followers of Muhammed, on the supposition that it was designed to have such a reference:<p>(a) As to numbers. "They (the Midianite Arabs) came as locusts for multitude," <a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a>. See the notes on <a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a>. Nothing would better represent the numbers of the Saracenic hordes that came out of Arabia, and that spread over the East - over Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Spain, and that threatened to spread over Europe - than such an army of locusts. "One hundred years after his flight (Muhammed) from Mecca," says Mr. Gibbon, "the arms and the reign of his successors extended from India to the Atlantic Ocean, over the various and distant provinces which may be comprised under the names of Persia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, and Spain," vol. iii. p. 410. "At the end of the first century of the Hegira the caliphs were the most potent and absolute monarchs on the globe. Under the last of the Ommiades the Arabian empire extended two hundred days' journey from east to west, from the confines of Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean" (ibid. p. 460). In regard to the immense hosts employed in these conquests, an idea may be formed by a perusal of the whole fifty-first chapter in Gibbon (vol. iii. pp. 408-461). Those hosts issued primarily from Arabia, and in their numbers would be well compared with the swarms of locusts that issued from the same country, so numerous as to darken the sky.<p>(b) The description of the people.<p>"Their faces were as the faces of men" This would seem to be in contrast with other people, or to denote something that was unique in the appearance of the persons represented. In other words, the meaning would seem to be, that there was something manly and warlike in their appearance, so far as their faces were concerned. It is remarkable that the appearance of the Goths (represented, as I suppose, under the previous trumpets) is described by Jerome (compare on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8.htm">Isaiah 8</a>) as quite the reverse. They are described as having faces shaven and smooth; faces, in contrast with the bearded Romans, like women's faces.  Is it fancy to suppose that the reference here is to the beard and moustache of the Arabic hosts? We know with what care they regarded the beard; and if a representation was made of them, especially in contrast with nations that shaved their faces, and who thus resembled women, it would be natural to speak of those represented in the symbol as "having faces as the faces of men."<p>"They had hair as the hair of women" A strange mingling of the appearance of effeminacy with the indication of manliness and courage. See the notes on <a href="/revelation/9-8.htm">Revelation 9:8</a>. And yet this strictly accords with the appearance of the Arabs or Saracens. Pliny, the contemporary of John, speaks of the Arabs then as having the hair long and uncut, with the moustache on the upper lip, or the beard: Arabes mitrati sunt, aut intoso crine. Barba abraditur, praeterquam in superiore labro. Aliis et haec intonsa (Nat. Hist. vol. 6, p. 28). So Solinus describes them in the third century (Plurimis crinis intonsus, mitrata capita, pars rasa in cutem barba, 100:53); so Ammianus Marcellinus, in the fourth century (Crinitus quidam a Saracenorum cuneo, vol. xxxi. p. 16); and so Claudian, Theodore of Mopsuesta, and Jerome, in the fifth. Jerome lived about two centuries before the great Saracen invasion; and as he lived at Bethlehem, on the borders of Arabia, he must have been familiar with the appearance of the Arabs. Still later, in that most characteristic of Arab poems, Antar, a poem written in the time of Muhammed's childhood, we find the moustache, and the beard, and the long flowing hair on the shoulder, and the turban, all specified as characteristic of the Arabians: "He adjusted himself properly, twisted his whiskers, and folded up his hair under his turban, drawing it from off his shoulders," vol. i. p. 340. "His hair flowed down on his shoulders," vol. i. p. 169. "Antar cut off Maudi's hair in revenge and insult," vol. iii. p. 117. "We will hang him up by his hair," vol. iv. p. 325. See Elliott, vol. i. pp. 411, 412. Compare Newton on the Prophecies, p. 485.<p>"And on their heads were as it were crowns of gold" See the notes on <a href="/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7</a>. That is, diadems, or something that appeared like crowns, or chaplets. This will agree well with the turban worn by the Arabs or Saracens, and which was quite characteristic of them in the early periods when they became known. So in the passage already quoted, Pliny speaks of them as Arabes mitrati; so Solinus, mitrata capita; so in the poem of Antar, "he folded up his hair under his turbans." It is remarkable also that Ezekiel E<a href="/zechariah/23-42.htm">Zechariah 23:42</a> describes the turbans of the Sabean or Keturite Arabs under the very appellation used here by John: "Sabeans from the wilderness, which put beautiful crowns upon their heads." So in the preface to Antar, it is said, "It was a usual saying among them, that God had bestowed four special things on the Arabs; that their turbans should be unto them instead of diadems, their tents instead of walls and houses, their swords instead of intrenchments, and their poems instead of written laws." Mr. Forster, in his Mohammedanism Unveiled, quotes as a precept of Muhammed; "Make a point of wearing turbans, because it is the way of angels." Turbans might then with propriety be represented as crowns, and no doubt these were often so gilded and ornamented that they might be spoken of as "crowns of gold."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Just as in the case of godly Job, Satan was allowed to torment with elephantiasis, but not to touch his life. In Re 9:20, these two woe-trumpets are expressly called "plagues." Andreas of C&aelig;sarea, A.D. 500, held, in his Commentary on Revelation, that the locusts mean evil spirits again permitted to come forth on earth and afflict men with various plagues.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Solomon saith, <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/30-27.htm" title="The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;">Proverbs 30:27</a></span>, <span class="ital">The locusts have no king, yet go they forth by bands; </span> according to which these locusts cannot be understood of insects so called; or, if they have a king, yet it is certain the devil is not their king, who is here called <span class="ital">the angel of the bottomless pit.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Abaddon; </span> from dba he hath destroyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Apollyon; </span> that is, a destroyer; intimating that the whole business of this barbarous enemy should be to ruin and destroy nations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they had a king over them,....

Abulpharagius (w), an Arabic writer, relates, that in the times of the Chalif Al-walid, there was one Hejajus, who had caused to be slain, of the chief and illustrious men, an hundred and twenty thousand, besides others of the common people, and that fell in war; moreover, that there died in his prison fifty thousand men, and thirty thousand women: and the same writer reports (x), that the famous Abu Moslem put to death six hundred thousand men, who were known, besides those that were unknown, and whom he slew in wars and battles: both these instances are taken notice of by Mr. Daubuz, who justly observes, that surely nothing can come near this "Abaddon", but the beast, the son of perdition, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>. And to him, the pope of Rome, may the name be truly applied, who has led thousands into perdition, and will go into it himself; and both he, and the false prophet, with the devil, will be east into the lake, which burns with fire and brimstone, and will be tormented for ever and ever, <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>.

As in their form and entire nature, the demoniacal locusts are distinguished from those which are natural,[2584] also in that they have a king, viz., <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ἌΓΓΕΛΟΝ Τῆς ἈΒΎΣΣΟΥ</span></span></span>, i.e., not “an angel from the abyss,”[2585] but the angel of the abyss, by which, however, not Satan himself is to be understood;[2586] since this is indicated neither by the designation, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἌΓΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΒ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, nor the definite appellation. Still less is the “king” to be identified with the “star,” <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>, as Hengstenb.[2587] must do, because he assumes that as often as a star is mentioned in the Apoc. a ruler is meant, and therefore says here, “If what is said here were concerning another king, the locusts would have two kings.” The expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ἌΓΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΒ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>[2588] makes us think only of such an angel as is in a special way the overseer of the abyss.[2589] One thing, pertaining to this position of his, is here mentioned, viz., that he is the king of the locusts rising from the abyss. As the overseer of the abyss, however, he is not only designated its angel, but bears also the very name which in its Heb. form expressly indicates that relation: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὌΝΟΜΑ ΑὐΤῼ ἘΒΡΑΪΣΤῚ ʼΑΒΑΔΔῺΝ ΚΑῚ ἘΝ Τῇ ἘΛΛΗΝΙΚῇ ὌΝΟΜΑ ἜΧΕΙ ἈΠΟΛΛΎΩΝ</span></span></span>. Already in the O. T., <span class="greekheb">אַבַדּוֹך</span> (LXX.: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΏΛΕΙΑ</span></span></span>), parallel with <span class="greekheb">שְׁאוֹל</span>, designates the kingdom of corruption in a local respect;[2590] with the rabbins, Abaddon is the lowest space of hell.[2591] Accordingly the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΒΥΣΣΟς</span></span></span> itself receives the name <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΒ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>; but very appropriately the angel of the abyss here bears it, who as overseer is in a certain respect its personal representative. The Greek interpretation <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΛΛΎΩΝ</span></span></span> is given in this form—not as possibly <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΛΟΘΡΕΥΤΉς</span></span></span>, etc., not to give a sound corresponding with the name Apollo,[2592] but because in the LXX. the personal name is naturally connected with the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΏΛΕΙΑ</span></span></span>. An express contrast between Apollyon the Destroyer, and Jesus the Saviour, can be found only by those who[2593] understand the former as Satan himself.

Perhaps, for accurate distinction’s sake, we must not identify him with Satan himself (cf. ch. <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>), but must regard him as one of the principal of the bad angels.” Weiss (<span class="ital">Bib. Theol. of N.

The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>) symbolized by stars, to fall away from God, so that they are now designated as his angels. It is such a Satan-angel who is the star fallen from heaven (<a href="/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>), who lets loose the plague of locusts from the abyss over the inhabitants of the earth, and is expressly designated (<a href="/revelation/9-11.htm" title="And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon.">Revelation 9:11</a>) as the angel of the abyss, Abaddon or Apollyon.” Luthardt emphasizes the contrast which Düsterdieck rejects, and closely follows Hengstenberg: “The angel of the abyss, i.e., Satan. Between him and the Saviour the choice of the world is divided. He who will not have the latter as Lord must have the former, who is hereafter to attain still greater power on earth than now; cf. <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:...">2 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>.” Beck objects to the identification of the angel and the star, on the ground that the latter was only “an astronomico-physical phenomenon.” But to what, then, does the <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> of <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a> refer?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">And they had a king</span>] Whereas “the (natural) locusts have no king,” <a href="/proverbs/30-27.htm" title="The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;">Proverbs 30:27</a>.

By the Hebrew and Greek nomenclature of this angel, Patrick Forbes and James Durham acknowledge that the Jews and Greeks, harassed by the locusts, are pointed out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[95] <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄγγελον τῆς ἀβύσσου</span>, <span class="ital">the angel of the bottomless pit</span>) This is not Satan himself.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">they have over them as king the angel of the abyss</span> (Revised Version). Most commentators contrast with the condition of the natural locusts, who have no king (<a href="/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7</a>). "The angel" evidently, points to the star of ver. l, who is Satan himself. Some think a particular angel, not Satan, is intended. Alford unnecessarily hesitates to decide that Satan is meant, owing to <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3, 9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</span> <span class="accented">Abaddon</span> is the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, a noun representing the abstract idea "destruction" (<a href="/job/31-12.htm">Job 31:12</a>), but more frequently employed to designate the netherworld (<a href="/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>; <a href="/job/28-22.htm">Job 28:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-12.htm">Psalm 88:12</a>). Apollyon (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, present participle) is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (by which the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) personified. It is in conformity with St. John's usual practice to give the two forms of the name (cf. <a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 42</a>; <a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>; <a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>; <a href="/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a>; <a href="/john/19-13.htm">John 19:13, 17</a>). In the name we have summed up the character of him who bears it. He is the "destroyer," the one who causes "perdition" to mankind. Cf. the words of our Lord given by St. John (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), "He was a murderer from the beginning." Bengel and others contrast with "Jesus" the "Saviour." Perhaps the height of absurdity is reached by those writers (Bleek, Volkmar) who see in the name Apollyon a reference to (N)apoleon. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They had a king over them (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;' &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;).<p>Render, as Rev., they have over them as king.
