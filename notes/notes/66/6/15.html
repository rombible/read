and say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the day, the great (day) of His wrath came (or, </span>is come); and who is able to stand? In the list of the great ones here we may notice the descending order—kings, magnates or statesmen, generals, rich men, strong men, bond and free men. The terror strikes into every class: monarchs and their advisers, the statesmen and diplomatists, the commanders of troops, the merchant princes, the men of ability, as well as the obscurer orders of society. Neither royalty, nor rank, nor force of arms, nor opulence, nor talent, nor strength, either of intellect or frame, avail in that crisis; neither does insignificance escape in that day when God brings to light the hidden things. The tests of God are spiritual, as the weapons of God’s war are not carnal. Men who have relied upon wealth, rank, or power, have prepared themselves against one form of trial, but find themselves unarmed in the day of spiritual testing. Like Macbeth, they are unable to fight with the unexpected shape which haunts them. They would rather meet the bodily foe, “who would dare them to the desert with a sword.”<p>Thus in the final day of judgment the revealing of the spiritual order of all life will confound men whose minds have been blinded by their entire absorption in world-splendours and world-powers. Nor is it merely the unveiling of the forgotten spiritual order which will confound them. The advent is of a Person. It is more than the manifestation of the kingdom of Him who all this while had been King on His throne, and whom they had forgotten—it is the revealing of God’s Son from heaven. It is not without significance that He is described as the Lamb. In that day of His wrath, it is not as a Judge who has laid aside the tokens of His humiliation and suffering: it is as the Lamb. He whom they now shrink from is He who came meek as a lamb, gentle, pure, and suffering on their behalf. He whom they now behold with dismay is He whom they treated with neglect, and whose love they spurned.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:12-17 When the sixth seal was opened, there was a great earthquake. The foundations of churches and states would be terribly shaken. Such bold figurative descriptions of great changes abound in the prophecies of Scripture; for these events are emblems, and declare the end of the world and the day of judgment. Dread and terror would seize on all sorts of men. Neither grandeur, riches, valour, nor strength, can support men at that time. They would be glad to be no more seen; yea, to have no longer any being. Though Christ be a Lamb, he can be angry, and the wrath of the Lamb is exceedingly dreadful; for if the Redeemer himself, who appeases the wrath of God, be our enemy, where shall we find a friend to plead for us? As men have their day of opportunity, and their seasons of grace, so God has his day of righteous wrath. It seems that the overthrow of the paganism of the Roman empire is here meant. The idolaters are described as hiding themselves in their dens and secret caves, and vainly seeking to escape ruin. In such a day, when the signs of the times show those who believe in God's word, that the King of kings is approaching, Christians are called to a decided course, and to a bold confession of Christ and his truth before their fellowmen. Whatever they may have to endure, the short contempt of man is to be borne, rather than that shame which is everlasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal - See the notes at <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>.<p>And, lo, there was a great earthquake - Before endeavoring to ascertain to what the sixth seal was designed to refer, it is proper, as in the previous cases, to furnish a particular explanation of the meaning of the symbols. All the symbols represented in the opening of this seal denote consternation, commotion, changes; but still they are all significant, and we are to suppose that something would occur corresponding with each one of them. It cannot be supposed that the things here described were represented on the part of the roll or volume that was now unfolded in any other way than that they were pictures, or that the whole was a species of panoramic representation made to pass before the eyes. Thus understood, it would not be difficult to represent each one of these things in a painting: as the heaving ground - the agitated forests - the trembling hills - the falling cities and houses - the sun blackened, and the moon turned to blood:<p>(a) The earthquake, <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>; "There was a great earthquake." The word used here denotes a shaking or agitation of the earth. The effect, when violent, is to produce important changes - opening chasms in the earth; throwing down houses and temples; sinking hills, and elevating plains; causing ponds and lakes to dry up, or forming them where none existed; elevating the ocean from its bed, rending rocks, etc. As all that occurs in the opening of the other seals is symbolical, it is to be presumed that this is also, and that for the fulfillment of this we are not to look for a literal earthquake, but for such agitations and changes in the world as would be properly symbolized by this. The earthquake, as a symbol, would merely denote great agitations or overturnings on the earth. The particular character of those changes must be determined by other circumstances in the symbol that would limit and explain it.<p>There are, it is said, but three literal earthquakes referred to in the Scripture: that mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; that in Uzziah's time, <a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>; and what took place at the Saviour's death. All the rest are emblematical or symbolical-referring mostly to civil commotions and changes. Then in <a href="//biblehub.com/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a>; "Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land, and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts." That is, there would be great agitations in the world before he came. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-28</a>. So also great changes and commotions are referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19-20</a>; "The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage." An earthquake, if there were no other circumstances limiting and explaining the symbol, would merely denote great agitation and commotion - as if states and empires were tumbling to ruin. As this is here a mere symbol, it is not necessary to look for a literal fulfillment, or to expect to find in history actual earthquakes to which this had reference, anymore than when it is said that "the heavens departed as a scroll" we are to expect that they will be literally rolled up; but if, in the course of history, earthquakes preceded remarkable political convulsions and revolutions, it would be proper to represent such events in this way.<p>(b) The darkening of the sun: "And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair." Sackcloth was a coarse black cloth, commonly, though not always, made of hair. It was used for sacks, for strainers, and for mourning garments; and as thus worn it was not an improper emblem of sadness and distress. The idea here is, that the sun put on a dark, dingy, doleful appearance, as if it were in mourning. The general image, then, in this emblem, is that of calamity - as if the very sun should put on the robes of mourning. We are by no means to suppose that this was literally to occur, but that some great calamity would happen, of which this would be an appropriate emblem. See the <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a> note; <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a> note; Compare <a href="/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>; 1, 3; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>; <a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15-16</a>; <a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>. What is the particular nature of the calamity is to be learned from other parts of the symbol.<p>(c) The discoloration of the moon: "And the moon became as blood." Red like blood - either from the smoke and vapor that usually precedes an earthquake, or as a mere emblem. This also would betoken calamity, and perhaps the symbol may be so far limited and modified by this as to denote war, for that would be most naturally suggested by the color - red. Compare the notes on <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a> of this chapter. But any great calamity would be appropriately represented by this - as the change of the moon to such a color would be a natural emblem of distress.<p>(d) The falling of the stars, <a href="/revelation/6-13.htm">Revelation 6:13</a>; "And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth." This language is derived from the poetic idea that the sky seems to be a solid concave, in which the stars are set, and that when any convulsion takes place, that concave will be shaken, and the stars will be loosened and fall from their places. See this language explained in the notes on <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. Sometimes the expanse above us is spoken of as a curtain that is spread out, and that may be rolled up; sometimes as a solid crystalline expanse in which the stars are fixed. According to either representation the stars are described as falling to the earth. If the expanse is rolled up, the stars, having nothing to support them, fall if violent tempests or concussions shake the heavens, the stars, loosened from their fixtures, fall to the earth. Stars, in the Scriptures, are symbols of princes and rulers (see <a href="/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>); and the natural meaning of this symbol is, that there would be commotions which would unsettle princes, and bring them down from their thrones - like stars falling from the sky.<p>Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs - Mart., "green"; Greek, &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  olunthous. This word properly denotes "winter-figs," or such as grow under the leaves, and do not ripen at the proper season, but hang upon the trees during the winter (Robinson, Lexicon). This fruit seldom matures, and easily falls off in the spring of the year (Stuart, in loco). A violent wind shaking a plantation of fig-trees would of course cast many such figs to the ground. The point of the comparison is, the ease with which the stars would seem to be shaken from their places, and hence, the ease with which, in these commotions, princes would be dethroned.<p>(e) The departing of the heavens, <a href="/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>; "And the heaven departed as a scroll." That is, as a book or volume - &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  biblion - rolled up. The heavens are here described as spread out, and their passing away is represented by the idea that they might be rolled up, and thus disappear. See the notes on <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. This, too, is a symbol, and we are not to suppose that it will literally occur. Indeed it never can literally occur; and we are not, therefore, to look for the fulfillment of this in any physical fact that would correspond with what is here said. The plain meaning is, that there would be changes as if such an event would happen; that is, that revolutions would occur in the high places of the earth, and among those in power, as if the stars should fall, and the very heavens were swept away. This is the natural meaning of the symbol, and this accords with the usage of the language elsewhere.<p>(f) The removal of mountains and islands, <a href="/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>; "And every mountain and island were moved out of their places." This would denote convulsions in the political or moral world, as great as would occur in the physical world if the very mountains were removed and the islands should change their places. We are not to suppose that this would literally occur; but we should be authorized from this to expect that, in regard to those things which seemed to be permanent and fixed on an immov able basis, like mountains and islands, there would be violent and important changes. If thrones and dynasties long established were overthrown; if institutions that seemed to be fixed and per manent were abolished; if a new order of things should rise in the political world, the meaning of the symbol, so far as the language is concerned, would be fulfilled.<p>(g) The universal consternation, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>; "And the kings of the earth, etc." The design of these verses <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>, in the varied language used, is evidently to denote universal consternation and alarm - as if the earth should be convulsed, and the stars should fall, and the heavens should pass away. This consternation would extend to all classes of people, and fill the world with alarm, as if the end of all things were coming.<p>The kings of the earth - Rulers - all who occupied thrones.<p>The great men - High officers of state.<p>And the rich men - Their wealth would not secure them from destruction, and they would be alarmed like others.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. kings &#8230; hid themselves&#8212;Where was now the spirit of those whom the world has so greatly feared?

Some ascribed this to frenzy and madness (q); but the true reason was, that the wrath of the Lamb was let into their consciences, and which they could not bear, and which obliged them to take this step, to the amazement of the whole world. Maximinus, who succeeded them, being overcome by Licinius, laid aside his imperial habit, and hid himself among the common people, and skulked about in fields and villages (r). Maxentius, another emperor, fled from Constantine, the instrument of the wrath of the Lamb, and the pouring it out upon his enemies, and fell into the river Tiber, from the Mylvian bridge, where he perished; and which was the very place in which he had laid snares for Constantine (s). <p>(p) Contur.

The panic of kings, etc., is taken from the description of the judgment in Enoch 62–63, where before the throne of messiah “the mighty and the kings” in despairing terror seek repentance in vain; “and one portion of them will look on the other, and they will be terrified, and their countenance will fall, and pain will seize them,” at the sight of messiah. In Apoc. Bar. xxv. also the approach of the end is heralded by stupor of heart and despair among the inhabitants of the earth, while a similar stress falls (in Sap. 6:1-9) on kings, etc., and (in En. xxxvii.–lxxi. generally) on the earth’s rulers.

Weiss, Briggs); it may be a characteristic touch designed to point the O.T. citation (for <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> in 17 or in <a href="/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a> <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.">1 Thessalonians 3:11</a>, <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,...">2 Thessalonians 2:16-17</a>), rather than a scribal or editorial insertion in what was originally a Jewish source.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The great day of God’s wrath has come, but the action is interrupted by an <span class="ital">entre-acte</span> in 7, where as in <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm" title="And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:">Revelation 10:1</a> to <a href="/revelation/11-13.htm" title="And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.">Revelation 11:13</a>, the author introduces an intermezzo between the sixth and the seventh members of the series. A change comes over the spirit of his dream. But although this oracle is isolated by form and content from its context, it is a consoling rhapsody or rapture designed to relieve the tension by lifting the eyes of the faithful over the foam and rocks of the rapids on which they were tossing to the calm, sunlit pool of bliss which awaited them beyond. They get this glimpse before the seventh seal is opened with its fresh cycle of horrors. The parenthesis consists of two heterogeneous visions, one (<a href="/context/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see....">Revelation 6:1-8</a>) on earth and one (<a href="/context/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:...">Revelation 6:9-17</a>) in heaven. The former (and indeed the whole section, <span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἑστῶτες</span> of 9) is an implicit answer to the query of <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm" title="For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?">Revelation 6:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">τίς δύναται σταθῆναι</span>; it is an enigmatic fragment of apocalyptic tradition, which originally predicted (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/ezekiel/9-1.htm" title="He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.">Ezekiel 9:1</a> f.) God’s safeguarding of a certain number of Jews, prior to some catastrophe of judgment (“Cry havoc, and let slip the winds of war!”) upon the wicked. The chapter is not a literary unit with editorial touches (Weyland, Erbes, Bruston, Rauch), nor is 9–17 a continuation of 6. (Spitta). <a href="/context/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see....">Revelation 6:1-8</a> are a Jewish fragment incorporated ay the author, who writes 9–17 himself (so, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Vischer, Pfleiderer, Schmidt, Porter, Bousset, von Soden, Scott, Wellhausen). The fact that a selection, and not the whole, of the Jews are preserved, does not (in view of 4 Esdras) prove that a Jewish Christian (Völter, J. Weiss) must have written it. The scenery is not organic to John’s proper outlook. After <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.">Revelation 6:8</a> he shows no further interest in it. The winds are never loosed. The sealing itself is not described. The sealed are not seen. An apparent allusion to this remnant does occur (<a href="/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>), but it is remote; John makes nothing of it; and the detached, special character of <a href="/context/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree....">Revelation 7:1-8</a> becomes plainer the further we go into the other visions. The sealed are exempted merely from the plague of the winds, not from martyrdom or persecution (of which there is no word here); one plague indeed has power to wound, though not to kill, them (<a href="/context/revelation/9-4.htm" title="And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads....">Revelation 9:4-5</a>). The collocation of the fragment with what precedes is probably due in part to certain similarities like the allusions to the wind (<a href="/revelation/6-13.htm" title="And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.">Revelation 6:13</a>), numbering (<a href="/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>), and the seals (<a href="/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.">Revelation 6:1</a> f.). The real problem is, how far did John take this passage literally? This raises the question of the relationship between 1–8 and 9–17; either (<span class="ital">a</span>) both are different forms of the same belief, or (<span class="ital">b</span>) two different classes of people are meant. In the former event (<span class="ital">a</span>) John applies the Jewish oracle of 1–8 to the real Jews, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Christians, who as a pious remnant are to be kept secure amid the cosmic whirl and crash of the latter days (<a href="/context/revelation/6-12.htm" title="And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, see, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;...">Revelation 6:12-17</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm" title="Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.">Revelation 3:10</a> and the connexion of <a href="/context/nahum/1-5.htm" title="The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yes, the world, and all that dwell therein....">Nahum 1:5-7</a>). The terror passes and lo the saints are seen safe on the other side (<a href="/context/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:...">Revelation 6:9-17</a>). This interpretation of Christians as the real Israel or twelve tribes is favoured not only by early Christian thought (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1 Peter 1:1</a>, <a href="/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">Jam 1:1</a>, Herm. <span class="ital">Sim.</span> ix. 17), but by the practice of John himself (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/revelation/18-4.htm" title="And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues.">Revelation 18:4</a>). Here as elsewhere he takes the particularist language of his source in a free symbolic fashion; only, while the archaic scenery of 1–8 suffices for a description of the safeguarded on earth, he depicts their beatified state (<a href="/context/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:...">Revelation 6:9-17</a>) in ampler terms. The deeper Christian content of his vision implies not deliverance from death but deliverance through death. His saints are not survivors but martyrs. Hence the contrast between 1–8 and 9–17 is one of language rather than of temper, and the innumerable multitude of the latter, instead being a supplement to the 144,000, are the latter viewed after their martyr-death under a definitely Christian light. The O.T. imagery of 1–8 mainly brings out the fact that the true Israel (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>) is known and numbered by God; not one is lost. The alternative theory (<span class="ital">b</span>) holds that in taking over this fragment and adding another vision John meant Jewish Christians by the 144,000. The latter identification (so, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Prim., Vict., Hausrath, Vischer, Spitta, Hirscht, Forbes, Bousset) is less probable, however, in view of the general tenor of the Apocalypse (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Introd. § 6), for the usual passages cited as proof (<span class="ital">cf.</span> notes on <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a> f., <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm" title="And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:">Revelation 21:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm" title="And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it.">Revelation 21:24</a>) are irrelevant, and while John prized the martyrs it is incredible that 9–17 was meant to prove that martyrdom was required to admit Gentile Christians even to a second grade among the elect (Weizsäcker, Pfleiderer). A Jewish Christian prophet might indeed, out of patriotic pride, regard the nucleus of God’s kingdom as composed of faithful Jews, without being particularist in his sympathies. Paul himself once held this nationalist view (Romans 9-11.), but it is doubtful if it represented his final position, and in any case the general conception of the Apocalypse (where Christians are the true Jews, and where particularist language is used metaphorically, just because literally it was obsolete) tells on the whole in favour of the view that 9–17 represents 1–8 read in the light of <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a> (so, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, de Wette, Bruston, Porter, Wellhausen, and Hoennicke: <span class="ital">das Judenchristentum</span>, 194 f.). Only, the general description of redeemed Christians in <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a> is specifically applied in <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14</a> to the <span class="ital">candidatus martyrum exercitus</span>. Here as elsewhere John apparently conceives the final trial to be so searching and extensive that Christians will all be martyrs or confessors. The wonderful beauty of 9–17, whose truth rises above its original setting, requires no comment. It moved Renan (479, 480), after criticising “le contour mesquin” of the Apocalypse in general, to rejoice in the book’s “symbolical expression of the cardinal principle that God is, but above all that He <span class="ital">shall be</span>. No doubt Paul put it better when he summed up the final goal of the universe in these words, <span class="ital">that God may be all in all</span>.

Again, as in vers. 12-14, the enumeration is sevenfold; thus denoting the universality and completeness of the extent of the judgment (see <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of the earth<p>See on <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>.<p>Great men (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., princes.
