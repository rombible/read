They overcame him—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the accuser, the devil: their victory over him is “owing to” the blood of the Lamb. Who is he that condemneth, when Christ hath died? What power can the accusations of the adversary have when the Lamb of God hath taken away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>), and when we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus? (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>.) Dean Alford mentions the tradition that Satan accuses men all days of the year except on the Day of Atonement. But their victory is also in virtue of the <span class= "ital">word of their testimony:</span> in virtue of the word to which they bore witness; not simply, I think, because they had a word of God to which they could bear witness, but because they had a word of God and did bear witness to it. The Christian victory is a victory of dependence and of obedience: of dependence on Him without whom they can do nothing; and of obedience to Him: it is in keeping of His commandments there is great reward: and in bearing testimony that the testimony becomes a power and a treasure. So it was the man who did Christ’s commandments who was like the man whose house was founded on the rock. Theoretical religion relaxes the energy of faith, even though it may brace the intellect; practical religion invigorates faith, gives it its force, and moulds the heroism of those who, in their love of Christ, “love not their lives even unto death.” It is thought that these last words imply that the martyred saints alone are spoken of. This seems to me a mistake. It is true that in the martyr we have the fullest practical token of <span class= "ital">that</span> spirit of devotion to Christ which loves Him more than life itself; but the spirit of such devotion and such love has breathed in thousands who have never died the martyr’s death, but who have devoted their lives to Him they loved. The martyr spirit needs not death to show itself; many lose their lives for Christ’s sake who have never been called to lay down their lives for Him, and these, as truly as those who have passed away in the shroud of flame, have loved not their lives unto the death. “He may bid us die for Him: He does bid us live for Him. If we do not the one—the less—we may be quite sure that we shall never rise to the other—the higher and the more glorious” (Dr. Vaughan).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:7-11 The attempts of the dragon proved unsuccessful against the church, and fatal to his own interests. The seat of this war was in heaven; in the church of Christ, the kingdom of heaven on earth. The parties were Christ, the great Angel of the covenant, and his faithful followers; and Satan and his instruments. The strength of the church is in having the Lord Jesus for the Captain of their salvation. Pagan idolatry, which was the worship of devils, was cast out of the empire by the spreading of Christianity. The salvation and strength of the church, are only to be ascribed to the King and Head of the church. The conquered enemy hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appear there, to accuse the people of God. Let us take heed that we give him no cause to accuse us; and that, when we have sinned, we go before the Lord, condemn ourselves, and commit our cause to Christ as our Advocate. The servants of God overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb, as the cause. By the word of their testimony: the powerful preaching of the gospel is mighty, through God, to pull down strong holds. By their courage and patience in sufferings: they loved not their lives so well but they could lay them down in Christ's cause. These were the warriors and the weapons by which Christianity overthrew the power of pagan idolatry; and if Christians had continued to fight with these weapons, and such as these, their victories would have been more numerous and glorious, and the effects more lasting. The redeemed overcame by a simple reliance on the blood of Christ, as the only ground of their hopes. In this we must be like them. We must not blend any thing else with this.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they overcame him - That is, he was foiled in his attempt thus to destroy the church. The reference here, undoubtedly, is primarily to the martyr age and to the martyr spirit; and the meaning is, that religion had not become extinct by these accusations, as Satan hoped it would be, but lived and triumphed. By their holy lives, by their faithful testimony, by their patient sufferings, they showed that all these accusations were false, and that the religion which they professed Was from God, and thus in fact gained a victory over their accuser. Instead of being themselves subdued, Satan himself was vanquished, and the world was constrained to acknowledge that the persecuted religion had a heavenly origin. No design was ever more ineffectual than that of crushing the church by persecution, no victory was ever more signal than what was gained when it could be said that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church."<p>By the blood of the Lamb - The Lord Jesus - the Lamb of God. See the notes at <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>; compare the notes on <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>. The blood of Christ was that by which they were redeemed, and it was in virtue of the efficacy of the atonement that they were enabled to achieve the victory. Compare the notes on <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>. Christ himself achieved a victory over Satan by his death (see the <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a> note; <a href="/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a> note), and it is in virtue of the victory which he thus achieved that we are now able to triumph over our great foe.<p>"I ask them whence their victory came.<p>They, with united breath,<p>Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,<p>Their triumph to his death."<p>And by the word of their testimony - The faithful testimony which they bore to the truth. That is, they adhered to the truth in their sufferings, they declared their belief in it, even in the pains of martyrdom; and it was by this that they overcame the great enemy - that is, by this that the belief in the gospel was established and maintained in the world. The reference here is to the effects of persecution and to the efforts of Satan to drive religion from the world by persecution. John says that the result as he saw it in vision was, that the persecuted church bore a faithful testimony to the truth, and that the great enemy was overcome.<p>And they loved not their lives unto the death - They did not so love their lives that they were unwilling to die as martyrs. They did not shrink back when threatened with death, but remained firm in their attachment to their Saviour, and left their dying testimony to the truth and power of religion. It was by these means that Christianity was established in the world, and John, in the scene before us, saw it thus triumphant, and saw the angels and the redeemed in heaven celebrating the triumph. The result of the attempts to destroy the Christian religion by persecution demonstrated that it was to triumph. No more mighty power could be employed to crush it than was employed by the Roman emperors; and when it was seen that Christianity could survive those efforts to crush it it was certain that it was destined to live forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. they&#8212;emphatic in the Greek.

Had that blood not been shed, Satan's accusations would have been unanswerable; as it is, that blood meets every charge. Schottgen mentions the Rabbinical tradition that Satan accuses men all days of the year, except the day of atonement. Tittmann takes the Greek "dia," as it often means, out of regard to the blood of the Lamb; this was the impelling cause which induced them to undertake the contest for the sake of it; but the view given above is good Greek, and more in accordance with the general sense of Scripture.<p>by the word of their testimony&#8212;Greek, "on account of the word of their testimony." On the ground of their faithful testimony, even unto death, they are constituted victors. Their testimony evinced their victory over him by virtue of the blood of the Lamb.

I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father....">1 John 2:13-14</a>, is to be compared, although, as the form, so also the reference there is different. The perf. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΝΙΚΉΚΑΤΕ ΤῸΝ ΠΟΝΗΡΌΝ</span></span></span> describes the life of faith then existing in Christian young men, as having for its foundation the victory obtained over the wicked one by faith itself; the aor. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΊΚΗΣΑΝ ΑὐΤῸΝ</span></span></span>, however, by placing the victory over Satan as a definite fact entirely in the past, is <span class="ital">said</span> by a prolepsis similar to that whereby, in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a> sqq., believers are <span class="ital">beheld</span> in a proleptical vision after the victory has been won.[3141] In fact, the <span class="greekheb">ἐνίκησαν</span> is applicable not until the conflict lasting unto death, requiring the surrender of life in fidelity to the cause,[3142] is actually fought through, and the garment washed in the blood of the Lamb[3143] has been kept pure in spite of all the temptations and persecutions on the part of Satan. But although the worshippers know that the conflict against the dragon still in reality impends over their brethren on earth,[3144] yet they can celebrate the victory of believers as one already gained, because the victory won over Satan in heaven[3145] has rendered him an overcome enemy also to believers on earth. Since thus the victory still in fact to be won by believers—to which properly all the consolatory language of the Apoc. refers—is celebrated by these heavenly voices as already obtained, the strongest encouragement is given believers. Hence <a href="/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a> appears not as a “digression,”[3146] but is in every respect appropriate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤῸ ΑΊΜΑ ΤΟῦ ἈΡΝΊΟΥ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>.

This form of the presentation is no less suitable than the former;[3147] but in the first member <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤῸ ΑἸΜΑ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΡΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, the latter corresponds much more accurately with the inner connection, sustained by <a href="/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a>, to what precedes. Entirely analogous is the relation in <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a> between the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΝΙΚῶΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ΚἈΓῺ ἘΝΊΚΗΣΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>. The victory of believers on earth is based upon the victory won over Satan in heaven; the peculiar truth, however, in what is reported from <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a> on, and in the closest connection with <a href="/revelation/12-5.htm" title="And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.">Revelation 12:5</a>,—that, viz., which, beneath the shell of the occurrences beheld, must be properly understood as the actual cause of the victory for believers on earth,—is Christ’s victory over Satan. This victory the Lamb has won over the dragon by shedding his blood. The blood of the Lamb is therefore the cause of the victory of believers.[3148] In the same way the statement is added: <span class="greekheb">καὶ δαὶ τὸν λόγον τῆς μαρτυρίας αὐτων</span>. Here we would expect the gen., because the testimony given by believers presents itself most simply as the means whereby they conquer. De Wette is inclined to assume this mode of representation by “a sort of zeugma,” which he tries to maintain in the <span class="greekheb">διά</span>. But the <span class="greekheb">διά</span> with the accus. has its complete justification, because the word of the testimony of believers, like the blood of the Lamb, can appear as the objective ground of their victory, since it is the word of the testimony given by believers with all fidelity even unto death,[3149] yet, also, at the same time, the word of such testimony as believers have previously received, which they now have as the condition of their victory beyond and above themselves.[3150] Thus the word of testimony has also an objective side, according to which it appears, like the blood of the Lamb, as the ground, not as the means, of their victory; while, on the other hand, the blood of the Lamb can be considered the actual ground of the victory only when the subjective side, viz., the believing participation in this blood, or the being washed thereby,[3151] is kept in mind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἠγάπησεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

In opposition to the contemporary Jewish tradition (Ap.

This victory on earth depends on Christ’s previous defeat of evil in the upper world (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> above on <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>, also <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>) which formed its headquarters.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">by the blood</span>] More literally <span class="bld">because of the blood … and because of the word</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they loved not their lives</span>] St <a href="/john/12-25.htm" title="He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.">John 12:25</a>, St <a href="/luke/14-26.htm" title="If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:26</a> are the closest parallels among the similar sayings of our Lord.

Winer agrees with this view of the present passage, against Ewald and De Wette (p. 498 of Moulton's translation). "The Lamb," who was seen "as it had been slain" (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>) - Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And by the word of their testimony;</span> <span class="accented">and on account of the word, etc.</span> The one phrase is the natural complement of the other. "The blood of the Lamb" would have been shed in vain without the <span class="accented">testimony</span>, the outcome of the faith of his followers; that <span class="accented">testimony</span> would have been impossible without the shedding of the blood. <span class="cmt_word">And they loved not their lives unto the death;</span> <span class="accented">their life even unto death.</span> That is, they valued not their life in this world, even to the extent of meeting death for the sake of giving their testimony.
