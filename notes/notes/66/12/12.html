This is the cause of joy to the heavens, and to them that tabernacle (not “dwell”) in them. The word is (as in <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm" title="Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.">Revelation 7:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-6.htm" title="And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.">Revelation 13:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>) “tabernacle.” This allusion to the tabernacle where the glory of God and the mercy-seat were to be found, is not without force. The sacred imagery of the tabernacle of witness calls to mind the safe dwelling which the sanctuary of God afforded to those whose testimony was given in the wilderness of sorrow. Those who tabernacled in the secret place of the Most High could rejoice with joy unspeakable.<p><span class= "bld">Woe to</span> <span class= "bld">the inhabiters . . .</span>—Translate, <span class= "ital">Woe to the earth and the sea!</span> (the words “to the inhabiters of” are not found in the best MSS.) <span class= "ital">because the devil is gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing</span> (or, <span class= "ital">because he knoweth:</span> his knowledge that his season of power is short is the reason of his great wrath) <span class= "ital">that he hath </span>(<span class= "ital">but</span>)<span class= "ital"> a short season.</span> The painful consciousness of defeat has roused a deeper and more obstinate rage. Sin, which blunts the conscience, blinds the reason, and drives men madly to attempt the impossible, or to rouse<p>“the unconquerable will<p>And study of revenge, immortal hate,<p>And courage never to submit or yield.”<p>The <span class= "ital">woe</span> to the sea and earth is simply a warning voice to all that, though the foe is overcome and death smitten, yet that he has power, quickened by defeat and fear, for a last struggle; and that therefore they need to be sober and vigilant against the adversary. His season is short. He may be active, sowing tares among the wheat and animating various hostile powers, such as the wild beasts of Revelation 13; but he has only a season: there is a limit to his power and the time of his power. “A little while “was the word our Lord used to denote His time of absence (<a href="/context/john/16-16.htm" title="A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.">John 16:16-22</a>):” Behold, He comes quickly!”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 The church and all her friends might well be called to praise God for deliverance from pagan persecution, though other troubles awaited her. The wilderness is a desolate place, and full of serpents and scorpions, uncomfortable and destitute of provisions; yet a place of safety, as well as where one might be alone. But being thus retired could not protect the woman. The flood of water is explained by many to mean the invasions of barbarians, by which the western empire was overwhelmed; for the heathen encouraged their attacks, in the hope of destroying Christianity. But ungodly men, for their worldly interests, protected the church amidst these tumults, and the overthrow of the empire did not help the cause of idolatry. Or, this may be meant of a flood of error, by which the church of God was in danger of being overwhelmed and carried away. The devil, defeated in his designs upon the church, turns his rage against persons and places. Being faithful to God and Christ, in doctrine, worship, and practice, exposes to the rage of Satan; and will do so till the last enemy shall be destroyed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore rejoice, ye heavens - It is not unusual in the Scriptures to call on the heavens and the earth to sympathize with the events that occur. Compare the notes on <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>. Here the heavens are called on to rejoice because of the signal victory which it was seen would be achieved over the great enemy. Heaven itself was secure from any further rebellion or invasion, and the foundation was laid for a final victory over Satan everywhere.<p>And ye that dwell in them - The angels and the redeemed. This is an instance of the sympathy of the heavenly inhabitants - the unfallen and holy beings before the throne - with the church on earth, and with all that may affect its welfare. Compare the notes on <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>.<p>Woe to the inhabiters of the earth - This is not an imprecation, or a wish that woe might come upon them, but a prediction that it would. The meaning is this: Satan would ultimately be entirely overcome - a fact that was symbolized by his being cast out of heaven; but there would be still temporary war upon the earth, as if he were permitted to roam over the world for a time and to spread woe and sorrow there.<p>And of the sea - Those who inhabit the islands of the sea and those who are engaged in commerce. The meaning is, that the world as such would have occasion to mourn - the dwellers both on the land and on the sea.<p>For the devil is come down unto you - As if cast out of heaven.<p>Having great wrath - Wrath shown by the symbolical war with Michael and his angels <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>; wrath increased and inflamed because he has been discomfited; wrath the more concentrated because he knows that his time is limited.<p>Because he knoweth that he hath but a short time - That is, he knows that the time is limited in which he will be permitted to wage war with the saints on the earth. There is allusion elsewhere to the fact that the time of Satan is limited, and that he is apprised of that. Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>, "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?" See the notes on that passage. Within that limited space, Satan knows that he must do all that he ever can do to destroy souls, and to spread woe through the earth, and hence, it is not unnatural that he should be represented as excited to deeper wrath, and as rousing all his energy to destroy the church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Therefore&#8212;because Satan is cast out of heaven (Re 12:9).<p>dwell&#8212;literally, "tabernacle." Not only angels and the souls of the just with God, but also the faithful militant on earth, who already in spirit tabernacle in heaven, having their home and citizenship there, rejoice that Satan is cast out of their home. "Tabernacle" for dwell is used to mark that, though still on the earth, they in spirit are hidden "in the secret of God's tabernacle." They belong not to the world, and, therefore, exult in judgment having been passed on the prince of this world.<p>the inhabiters of&#8212;So Andreas reads. But A, B, and C omit. The words probably, were inserted from Re 8:13.<p>is come down&#8212;rather as Greek, "catebee," "is gone down"; John regarding the heaven as his standing-point of view whence he looks down on the earth.<p>unto you&#8212;earth and sea, with their inhabitants; those who lean upon, and essentially belong to, the earth (contrast Joh 3:7, Margin, with Joh 3:31; 8:23; 1Jo+4:5; Php 3:19, 1 John 4:5) and its sea-like troubled politics. Furious at his expulsion from heaven, and knowing that his time on earth is short until he shall be cast down lower, when Christ shall come to set up His kingdom (Re 20:1, 2), Satan concentrates all his power to destroy as many souls as he can. Though no longer able to accuse the elect in heaven, he can tempt and persecute on earth. The more light becomes victorious, the greater will be the struggles of the powers of darkness; whence, at the last crisis, Antichrist will manifest himself with an intensity of iniquity greater than ever before.<p>short time&#8212;Greek, "kairon," "season": opportunity for his assaults.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them:</span> he calls to the angels and saints again to rejoice; some think, to the church also: these tell us, that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the inhabitants of the earth, and of the sea, </span> in St. John’s writings, always signify the enemies of the church, earthly, carnal men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath; </span> the devil now being divested of the power he exercised against the church, will fall upon you; for though he principally hateth the saints, as most opposite to him, yet he is the common hater of mankind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Because he knoweth that he hath but a short time; </span> and he hath but a little time to execute his malice, he shall shortly be confined to the bottomless pit.

So in the prophetic language, at times, and upon occasions of rejoicing, the heavens are called upon to join, and bear a part therein, <a href="/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>; and by these may be meant here the angels of heaven, who rejoice at every advance of Christ's kingdom and interest; they rejoiced at his incarnation, and so they do at the conversion of every single sinner; and much more may they be thought to do so at such a time as this, when there were such multitudes of conversions, and the churches and interest of Christ in so flourishing a condition, and Satan's kingdom so much weakened; and to these may be joined the souls of the saints departed, who might be made acquainted with this wonderful change of things in the empire; and it may also be understood of the saints, the members of the several churches, even all heavenly minded persons, who were born from above, and were partakers of the heavenly calling, and whose conversations were in heaven; these are called upon to take their part in this song of praise and thanksgiving: <p>woe to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the sea: such as are of the earth, earthy, sensual, and earthly minded persons; and who are like the troubled waters, and raging waves of the sea, cannot rest, but cast up mire and dirt, and foam out their own shame; the barbarous nations of the Goths and Vandals, carnal professors of religion, and the antichristian party, which quickly upon this sprung up, may be intended, on whom this woe is denounced; the reason of which follows: <p>for the devil is come down unto you; and a greater woe cannot be upon men on earth, than to have the devil among them, who always brings mischief with him, and breathes nothing but ruin and destruction to men; he having lost his power in the Roman empire, possessed the above persons, and took up his residence among them; he came down, but not willingly, he was forced to it, he was cast down: <p>having great wrath; because he was conquered, and cast out of heaven, and was deprived of the worship that had been long given him, as the god of the world, and of that authority and influence which he had over men: and this his great wrath was seen in stirring up the Arians to persecute the Christians; and in the times of Julian, when he endeavoured to regain his lost power; and in bringing in the Goths, Huns, and Vandals, into the empire, to waste and destroy it; and in moving the antichristian party, which soon prevailed, to make war against the saints: <p>because he knoweth he hath but a short time; ere he should be shut up in the bottomless pit, or be confined in the place of torment, and ere his full punishment should be inflicted on him; which time of his to tempt, deceive, disturb, and distress men, is to be no longer than during the forty two months of antichrist's reign, and the 1260 days, or years, of the witnesses prophesying in sackcloth, and of the church's being in the wilderness, and no longer than till the thousand years' reign of Christ with his saints begins, which, in comparison of his long reign in the Gentile world, is but a short time; and though, after the thousand years are ended, he will be let loose, yet it will be but for a season, a very small time, when he will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, and be tormented night and day, for ever and ever. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.

Reason for the cry of woe: the earth and sea are to be the theatre for the activity of the devil, now allotted to this sphere, who will give vent to his great wrath the more as he knows that he has only a brief time. Instead of the <span class="greekheb">ἐβλήθη</span>, a <span class="greekheb">κατέβη</span> naturally occurs here, because, as a dreadful activity of the enraged enemy is portrayed, it is more appropriate that it should not be expressly marked that the descent of the enemy is involuntary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔχων θυμὸν μέγαν</span>. The great wrath belonging to the dragon because of his antichristic nature, he has shown already (<a href="/revelation/12-4.htm" title="And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.">Revelation 12:4</a>).

To this is added the fact, that the dragon knows that only a short time is allowed him. To identify this <span class="greekheb">ὀλίγον καιρόν</span> with the 3½ days mentioned in <a href="/revelation/17-11.htm" title="And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.">Revelation 17:11</a> “as the time of antichrist,”[3160] is as arbitrary as the reckoning of Bengel, who takes “the short time,” as somewhat longer than the 3½ times (<a href="/revelation/12-14.htm" title="And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.">Revelation 12:14</a>), i.e., equal to four times, or four times 222 2/9 years, and regards the period from the year 947 to the year 1836.
