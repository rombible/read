Sometimes the history which exemplifies these principles is immediate, sometimes more remote; in other cases (as, I venture to believe, is the case with the predictions of this book) the events are both immediate and remote. The prophecy gives us the rule, with some typical application illustrative of its method of working; after-history affords us the working out of various examples. We, then, as living actors in the world, have not only to read and hear, but to keep—keep in mind and action those principles which preside over the development of all human history (<a href="/james/1-22.htm" title="But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.">James 1:22</a>). The word “keep” is in itself a proof to me that the whole fulfilment of the Apocalypse could not have been exhausted in the earliest times, nor reserved to the latest times of the Church’s history, but that its predictions are applicable in all eras.<p><span class= "bld">The time is at hand.</span>—In the apostolic mind this was always true, though the restless idleness of the Thessalonians was blamed (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.">2Thessalonians 3:11-12</a>).

Its principal subject is to discover the purposes of God concerning the affairs of the church, and of the nations as connected therewith, to the end of the world. These events would surely come to pass; and they would begin to come to pass very shortly. Though Christ is himself God, and has light and life in himself, yet, as Mediator between God and man, he receives instructions from the Father. To him we owe the knowledge of what we are to expect from God, and what he expects from us. The subject of this revelation was, the things that must shortly come to pass. On all who read or hear the words of the prophecy, a blessing is pronounced. Those are well employed who search the Bible. It is not enough that we read and hear, but we must keep the things that are written, in our memories, in our minds, in our affections, and in practice, and we shall be blessed in the deed. Even the mysteries and difficulties of this book are united with discoveries of God, suited to impress the mind with awe, and to purify the soul of the reader, though he may not discern the prophetic meaning. No part of Scripture more fully states the gospel, and warns against the evil of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed is he that readeth - That is, it is to be regarded as a privilege attended with many blessings, to be permitted to mark the disclosures to be made in this book; the important revelations respecting future times. Prof. Stuart supposes that this refers to a public reading, and that the phrase "those who hear the words of this prophecy," refers to those who listened to the public reader, and that both the reader and hearer should regard themselves as highly favored. It is, however, more in accordance with the usual meaning of the word rendered "read," to suppose that it refers to the act of one's reading for himself; to learn by reading. So Robinson (Lexicon) understands it. The Greek word, indeed, would bear the other interpretation (see <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>; <a href="/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>); but as this book was sent abroad to be read by Christians, and not merely to be in the hands of the ministers of religion to be read by them to others, it is more natural to interpret the word in the usual sense.<p>And hear the words of this prophecy - As they shall be declared or repeated by others; or perhaps the word "hear" is used in a sense that is not uncommon, that of giving attention to; taking heed to. The general sense is, that they were to be regarded as highly favored who became acquainted in any way with what is here communicated. The writer does not say that they were blessed who understood it, or that they who read or heard it would fully understand it; but it is clearly implied, that there would be so far an understanding of its meaning as to make it a felicitous condition to have been made acquainted with it. An author could not be supposed to say that one should regard his condition as a favored one who merely heard words that he could not understand, or who had placed before him magnificent symbols that had to him no meaning. The word "prophecy" is used here in its more strict sense as denoting the disclosure of future events - a large portion of the book being of this nature. It is here synonymous with "Revelation" in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>.<p>And keep those things which are written therein - Keep in mind those things which relate to the future; and obey those things which arc required as truth and duty. The blessing which results from having in possession the revealed truth of God is not merely in reading it, or in hearing it: it results from the fact that the truth is properly regarded, and exerts a suitable influence over our lives. Compare <a href="/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>; "And in keeping of them there is great reward."<p>For the time is at hand - See <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>. The word used here -  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;  engus - has the same signification substantially as the word "shortly" in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>. It would apply to any event whose beginning was soon to occur, though the end might be remote, for the series of events might stretch far into the future. It cannot be doubted, however, that the writer meant to press upon them the importance of attending to these things, from the fact that either entirely or in part these things were soon to happen. It may be inferred from this verse, that it is possible so to "understand" this book, as that it may convey useful instruction. This is the only book in the Bible of which a special blessing is pronounced on him who reads it; but assuredly a blessing would not be pronounced on the perusal of a book which is entirely unintelligible. While, therefore, there may be many obscurities in this book, it is also to be assumed that it may be so far understood as to be useful to Christians, in supporting their faith, and giving them elevated views of the final triumph of religion, and of the glory of the world to come. Anything is a blessing which enables us with well-founded hope and joy to look forward to the heavenly world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. he that readeth, and they that hear&#8212;namely, the public reader in Church assemblies, and his hearers. In the first instance, he by whom John sent the book from Patmos to the seven churches, read it publicly: a usage most scriptural and profitable. A special blessing attends him who reads or hears the apocalyptic "prophecy" with a view to keeping the things therein (as there is but one article to "they that hear and keep those things," not two classes, but only one is meant: "they who not only hear, but also keep those things," Ro 2:13); even though he find not the key to its interpretation, he finds a stimulus to faith, hope, and patient waiting for Christ. Note: the term "prophecy" has relation to the human medium or prophet inspired, here John: "Revelation" to the Divine Being who reveals His will, here Jesus Christ.

In the worship of the Christian communities one member read aloud, originally from the O.T. as in the synagogues, and afterwards from Christian literature as well (apostolic epistles, <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm" title=" And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.">Colossians 4:16</a>, and sub-apostolic epistles), while the rest of the audience listened (Eus. <span class="ital">H. E.</span> iv. 23). In its present form the Apocalypse was composed with this object in view. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Justin’s description of the Christinn assemblies on Sunday, when, as the first business, <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἀπομνημονεύματα τῶν ἀποστόλων ἢ τὰ συγγράμματα τῶν προφητῶν ἀναγινώσκεται</span> (Apol. i. 67). The art of reading was not a general accomplishment in the circles from which the Christian societies were for the most part recruited, and this office of reader (<span class="greekheb">ἀναγνώστης</span>), as distinct from that of the president, soon became one of the regular minor positions in the worship of the church. Here the reader’s function resembles that of Baruch (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/jeremiah/22-5.htm" title="But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself, said the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation....">Jeremiah 22:5-6</a>). <span class="greekheb">τηροῦντες τὰ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., carefully heeding the warnings of the book, observing its injunctions, and expecting the fulfilment of its predictions, instead of losing heart and faith (<a href="/luke/18-8.htm" title="I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?">Luke 18:8</a>). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Hipp. <span class="ital">De Antich.</span> 2 and En. civ. 12, “books will be given to the righteous and the wise to become a cause of joy and uprightness and much wisdom”. The content of the Apocalypse is not merely prediction; moral counsel and religious instruction are the primary burden of its pages. The bliss of the obedient and attentive, however, is bound up with the certainty that the crisis at which the predictions of the book are to be realised is imminent; they have not to wait long for the fulfilment of their hopes. This, with the assurance of God’s interest and intervention, represented the ethical content of early Christian prediction, which would have been otherwise a mere satisfaction of curiosity; see on <a href="/revelation/1-19.htm" title="Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;">Revelation 1:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[<span class="ital">Note on</span> <a href="/context/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:...">Revelation 1:1-3</a>. If this inscription (absent from no MS.) is due to the author, it must have been added (so Bruston, Jülicher, Hirscht, Holtzm., Bs.), like the <span class="greekheb">προοίμιον</span> of Thucydides, after he had finished the book as a whole. But possibly it was inserted by the later hand of an editor or redactor (Völter, Erbes, Briggs, Hilg., Forbes, Wellhausen, J. Weiss, Simcox = elders of Ephesus, <a href="/john/21-24.htm" title="This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.">John 21:24</a>) rather than of a copyist (Spitta, Sabatier, Schön), who reproduced the Johannine style of the Apocalypse proper. At the same time, the change from the third to the first person (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm" title="I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.">Revelation 1:9</a>) is not unexampled (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/jeremiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:...">Jeremiah 1:1-4</a> f.; <a href="/context/ezekiel/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God....">Ezekiel 1:1-4</a>; Enoch repeatedly), and forms no sure proof of an original text overlaid with editorial touches; nor is a certain sententious objectivity (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Herod, <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm" title="And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.">Revelation 2:23</a>, etc.) unnatural at the commencement of a book, when the writer has occasion to introduce himself.

The apostolic Epistles were thus read, first by the Churches to which they were addressed, then by others in the neighbourhood (<a href="/colossians/4-16.htm" title=" And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.">Colossians 4:16</a>): even the sub-apostolic Epistles of Clement and Polycarp, and the decidedly post-apostolic one of Soter, Bishop of Rome, were in like manner read in the churches that originally received them, or to which their authors belonged. In the course of the second century, both the Gospels and the apostolic Epistles came to be read in churches generally, as the Law and the Prophets had been read in the synagogues. In the time of Justin Martyr (Apol. I. 67), not to insist on <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm" title="For the scripture said, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.">1 Timothy 5:18</a>, <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2 Peter 3:16</a>, it is plain that the New Testament Scriptures were thus recognised as sharing the authority and sanctity of the Old.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and keep those things</span>] Attend to them, <span class="ital">mind</span> them.

The word is constantly used of ‘keeping’ the Law, the Commandments, &c., throughout the N.

And from this it comes to pass that others, running into the contrary extreme, are unwilling to hear even the name of the Apocalypse, by which they ought to be stirred up: and on account of the singular multitude of unfortunate interpretations and conjectures which are without accomplishment, they distrust the book itself. Thence, whereas they wish to know all things, they reject the only method of knowing those things which the Lord <span class="ital">shews</span> as <span class="ital">about to happen</span>. Hence they esteem the endeavour to investigate the truth in this book as useless labour; they consider sloth as moderation, silence as prudence, and they regard and inquire about anything in preference to this, just as though it had been written: <span class="ital">Blessed is he who does not read, and they who do not hear, etc</span>. Let them see that they do not, in devising every pretext for refusing the heavenly gift, show weariness towards God (<a href="/context/isaiah/7-12.htm" title="But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD....">Isaiah 7:12-13</a>), and that they be not found UNGRATEFUL towards Christ. But rather, <span class="ital">Blessed is he who reads, and they who hear and keep</span>; especially in our times, which are not far distant from a great change of affairs, as we shall see. It is better, in inquiring into the times, if only faith, hope, and love have the chief place in our heart, to attempt as much as possible, and to incur ridicule (<a href="/genesis/37-19.htm" title="And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.">Genesis 37:19</a>), than, with the brave spirits of the world, to despise admonitions which appear paradoxical, and to be crushed with the accomplishment of the events, <a href="/daniel/2-34.htm" title="You saw till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image on his feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.">Daniel 2:34</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-45.htm" title="For as much as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.">Daniel 2:45</a>, compared with <a href="/matthew/22-44.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?">Matthew 22:44</a>, at the end; or, after the manner of the Jews, to be repeatedly expecting events already long accomplished. The Jews <span class="ital">curse</span> those who reckon the times of the Messiah: the Apocalypse <span class="ital">blesses</span> the good hearers of prophecy, which comprises the near approach of the time and the calculation of the intermediate times. The mournful variety of interpretations, it is true, increases daily: whence it happens that a kind of cloud is spread over the eyes of many, so that, although the truth is clearly placed before them, they admit it either less, or certainly not more, than they do specious inventions. And yet there are not wanting aids to understanding, in the case of all who rightly employ them, without throwing away the hope of understanding them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I. The foundation of all is a pure text, restored from the best copies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II. This book is most closely jointed: it arranges a multiplicity of subjects by means of seven epistles, seals, trumpets, and vials; it divides each of these sets of seven into a set of four, and of three; it interprets many things of itself, and declares what are <span class="ital">the seven stars; the seven candlesticks; the Lamb, and His seven horns and seven eyes; the incense; the dragon; the three spirits, like frogs; the heads and horns of the beast; the waters, where the whore sits; the fine linen; the testimony of Jesus; the second death; the Lamb’s wife</span>. It supplies us with most convenient formulæ: <span class="ital">the first woe is past</span>, etc.; <span class="ital">the number of a man, the measure of a man, which is that of an angel</span>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>III. The comparing of the ancient prophets is of service; and the evidence of the predictions of Jesus and the Apostles in the other books of the New Testament, and especially the evidence of the letter of the Apocalypse itself, and its own peculiar character, attempered with prophetic tropes. We will explain this particular point somewhat more fully.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1) The Lord Jesus has comprised in the Apocalypse the Remainder [Supplement] of <span class="ital">the old prophecy</span>, which belongs to the times subsequent to His Ascension and the coming of the Comforter, and the end of the Jewish system. And thus the book reaches from the old Jerusalem to the new Jerusalem, all things being reduced to one sum and to harmonious order; and it has great similarity to the ancient prophets. The beginning and the conclusion agree with <span class="ital">Daniel</span>; the description of the male child, and the promises given to Sion, agree with <span class="ital">Isaiah</span>; the judgment of Babylon, with <span class="ital">Jeremiah</span>; the fixing of the times, again, with <span class="ital">Daniel</span>, who followed Jeremiah; the architecture of the holy city, with <span class="ital">Ezekiel</span>, who followed Isaiah; the emblems of horses, of candlesticks, etc., with <span class="ital">Zechariah</span>. From these prophets many things more fully described by them are now repeated in a summary manner, and often in the same words. Therefore reference must be had to them. Nevertheless the Apocalypse has a kind of <span class="greekheb">αὐτάρκειαν</span> (<span class="ital">self-completeness</span>), and is of itself sufficient for its own interpretation, although you may not yet understand the old prophets, where they speak of the same things: in fact, this often supplies a clue for the understanding of those. Often also, under the agreement which there is between the Apocalypse and the old prophets, there lies concealed a certain difference; and the Apocalypse derives its stock from some ancient prophet, on which it inserts a new scion. Thus, for instance, Zechariah mentions two olive trees; John also has the same, but in a different meaning. Daniel has a beast with ten horns; John also has the same, but not altogether in the same sense. Here the difference in the words, the emblems, the circumstances, the times, ought studiously to be observed. But the plan of the Tabernacle erected and described by <span class="ital">Moses</span> is also of great value. For those heavenly things, unto the example and shadow of which the Levitical priests served, are accurately exhibited in the Apocalypse: <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2) <span class="ital">The Lord</span> foretold many things before His passion; for instance, <a href="/matthew/13-22.htm" title="He also that received seed among the thorns is he that hears the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.">Matthew 13:22</a>, and those which follow; <a href="/john/14-15.htm" title="If you love me, keep my commandments.">John 14:15</a>; but He did not foretell all things: for it was not yet the befitting time. Many things predicted by the Spirit of Christ are contained, in a scattered form, in the Epistles of John and the other apostles; namely, according as the necessity of those primitive times required. Now the Lord comprises all in one short book, having reference to the earlier ones, presupposing them, explaining, continuing, and interweaving them. It is altogether right, therefore, that we should compare them; but not to bring into comparison the fulness of these with the brevity of those.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the Evangelists Christ predicted the things which were about to happen before the dictation of the Apocalypse to John, and added a description of the Last things: in the Apocalypse he also mentioned intermediate events. From both, one whole as it were is made up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3) In this book there is set forth to view, not only a summary and key of prophecy, both that which has long preceded and that which is recent, but also a supplement, the seals having been before closed. Therefore it cannot but contain many things now for the first time revealed, and not found in the remaining books of Scripture, as Gomarus and Cluverus admit. They therefore show little gratitude towards a revelation of such dignity as this, and reserved too for Christ’s exalted state, who, if anything is for the first time revealed in it, or is described in more exact and definite terms, are on that account more slow to value it, and more cautious in receiving, or more bold in rejecting it. The importance of the argument, and the shortness of the book, prove that every word is of the greatest significance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀναγινώσκων καὶ οἱ ἀκούοντες</span>, <span class="ital">he who reads and they who hear</span>) <span class="ital">One person</span>, and, in the first instance, he, by whom John sent the book from Patmos into Asia, <span class="ital">used to read</span> publicly in the churches and many used to hear. Scripture highly commends the public reading of itself: <a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm" title="When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.">Deuteronomy 31:11</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-8.htm" title="So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.">Nehemiah 8:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-6.htm" title="Therefore go you, and read in the roll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house on the fasting day: and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.">Jeremiah 36:6</a>; <a href="/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="/acts/15-21.htm" title="For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.">Acts 15:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm" title=" And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.">Colossians 4:16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm" title="I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-13.htm" title="Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.">1 Timothy 4:13</a>. There would be more edification, if teachers would speak less of themselves, or, at any rate, if Scripture were more fully read to the multitude who are unlearned.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς προφητείας</span>, <span class="ital">of the prophecy</span>) In relation to Jesus Christ, it is a <span class="ital">revelation</span>; it is a <span class="ital">prophecy</span> in relation to John; and it is not until he is mentioned that the word <span class="ital">prophecy</span> is introduced. <span class="ital">Prophecies</span> support their claims by their own, and therefore by Divine authority; this is especially the case with the Apocalypse, which, on this account, does not quote the old prophecies, unless in a summary way, and that once only: ch. <a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>. In the other books of the New Testament the prophecies of the Old Testament are quoted, and for this reason, that their fulfilment may be proved; in the Apocalypse they are not quoted. Hence it came to pass, that when Surenhusius, for instance, had deduced quotations from the Old Testament, through each of the Evangelists, through the Acts of the Apostles, through the Pauline and General Epistles, he had nothing to bring forward as a quotation in the Apocalypse. In like manner Franc. Junius brought his Parallels to an end, thus writing at the conclusion: <span class="ital">There are indeed innumerable words, many sentiments, and not a few arguments throughout the whole book of the Apocalypse, which, with the greatest dignity, savour of the Old Testament; but their interpretation does not appear to belong to the present subject; both because the passages of Scripture</span> ARE NOT ADDUCED BY NAME (expressly), <span class="ital">or is any particular authority alleged, from which they are drawn, but, for the most part, two, three, or more passages are most skilfully and elegantly joined together; and also because, if any one should attempt this, he must of necessity undertake the interpretation of the whole book of the Apocalypse</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that readeth</span> this book publicly in the church, and <span class="cmt_word">they that hear</span> the book read, are equally blessed. There is grace promised to both minister and congregation who live up to the spirit of the Scriptures. St. John here suggests that a usage common in the Jewish Church (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>) may be adopted in the Christian Church. Probably this verse is the earliest authority for the public reading of the New Testament Scripture. It is very precarious to argue that "the Apocalypse, which points to this custom, cannot have been composed in the year 68," because this Christian custom is of later origin than 68. The official communications of apostles were sure to be read publicly in the churches (see Lightfoot on <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>). Until the new lectionary came into use, the blessing here promised to the liturgical use of the Apocalypse was sadly neglected in the English Church. One might almost have supposed that a blessing had been pronounced on those who do <span class="accented">not</span> read and do <span class="accented">not</span> hear the prophecy. <span class="cmt_word">The words of this prophecy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of the prophecy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the prophecy of this book" (<a href="/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7, 18</a>). That which is a revelation in reference to Christ is a prophecy in reference to John. "Prophecy" must not be narrowed down to the vulgar meaning of <span class="accented">fore</span>telling future events; it is the <span class="accented">forth</span>telling of the mind of God. Prophecy, in the narrow sense of prediction, cannot well be <span class="accented">kept.</span> It is God's call to repentance, obedience, steadfastness, and prayer that must be kept by both reader and hearers in order to bring a blessing. And if the words are to be kept, they can be understood. We have no right to set aside the Revelation as an insoluble puzzle (comp. <a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>, where, however, we have <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The time is at hand</span>. The appointed time, the season foreordained of God (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), is near. We may ask, with F.D. Maurice, "Did not the original writer use words in their simple, natural sense? If he told the hearers and readers of his day that <span class="accented">the time</span> was <span class="accented">at hand</span>, did he not mean them to understand that it <span class="accented">was</span> at hand?" No doubt. But that does not preclude us from interpreting the inspired words as referring, not only to events near St. John's time, but also to other events of which they were the foretastes and figures.
