The song of the redeemed, echoed by the hosts of angels, is now merged in the utterance of all. “Every creature which is in the heaven, and upon the earth, and beneath the earth, and upon the sea, and all the things that are in them, heard I saying—<p>“To Him that sitteth upon the throne,<p>And to the Lamb,<p>(Be) the blessing, and the honour,<p>And the glory, and the might,<p>To the ages of the ages.”<p>The song of praise rises from all quarters, and from all forms of creation. The whole universe, animate and inanimate, joins in this glad acclaim. To limit it to either rational or animate creation is to enfeeble the climax which this third chorus forms to the two preceding ones, and is to denude the passage of its fulness and of its poetry. The Hebrew mind delighted in representing every bird and every grass-blade as joining in God’s praise. “Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars, beasts and all cattle, creeping things and flying fowl,” as well as kings of the earth and all people, were called on to bless the name of the Lord. Christian poets have told us that “Earth with her thousand voices praises God.”<p>“Nature, attend! join every living soul,<p>Beneath the spacious temple of the sky,<p>In adoration join’d; and, ardent, raise<p>One general song! To Him, ye vocal gales,<p>Breathe soft, whose Spirit in your freshness breathes.<p>***And thou, majestic main,<p>A secret world of wonders in thyself,<p>Sound His stupendous praise, whose greater voice<p>Or bids you roar, or bids your roaring fall.<p>Soft roll your incense, herbs, and fruits, and flowers,<p>In mingled clouds to Him whose sun exalts,<p>Whose breath perfumes you, and whose pencil paints.”<p>—Thomson, <span class= "ital">Hymn to Seasons.</span><p>The Apostle who pictured all creation as waiting in eager expectation for the full redemption—the redemption of “the body” (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>), looked forward to the time when “the whole universe, whether animate or inanimate, would bend the knee in homage and raise its voice in praise” (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Philippians 2:10</a>). The doxology which thus rises from the universe is appropriately four-fold: the definite article (omitted in the English version) must be supplied before each word (“<span class= "ital">The</span> blessing,” &c.). The two preceding songs were in honour of the Lamb; in this last the praise is addressed to the Throned One and to the Lamb. This linking of the Lamb with God as the Throned One is common throughout the book. Here they are linked in praise; in <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a> they are linked in wrath; in <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm" title="For the Lamb which is in the middle of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.">Revelation 7:17</a> they are linked in ministering consolation; in <a href="/context/revelation/19-6.htm" title="And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns.">Revelation 19:6-7</a>, they are linked in triumph.

He governs the world, not merely as a Creator, but as our Saviour. The harps were instruments of praise; the vials were full of odours, or incense, which signify the prayers of the saints: prayer and praise should always go together. Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage of sin, guilt, and Satan. He has not only purchased liberty for them, but the highest honour and preferment; he made them kings and priests; kings, to rule over their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he makes them priests; giving them access to himself, and liberty to offer up spiritual sacrifices. What words can more fully declare that Christ is, and ought to be worshipped, equally with the Father, by all creatures, to all eternity! Happy those who shall adore and praise in heaven, and who shall for ever bless the Lamb, who delivered and set them apart for himself by his blood. How worthy art thou, O God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of our highest praises! All creatures should proclaim thy greatness, and adore thy majesty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And every creature which is in heaven - The meaning of this verse is, that all created things seemed to unite in rendering honor to Him who sat on the throne, and to the Lamb. in the previous verse a certain number - a vast host - of angels are designated as rendering praise as they stood round the area occupied by the throne, the elders, and the living creatures; here it is added that all who were in heaven united in this ascription of praise.<p>And on the earth - All the universe was heard by John ascribing praise to God. A voice was heard from the heavens, from all parts of the earth, from under the earth, and from the depths of the sea, as if the entire universe joined in the adoration. It is not necessary to press the language literally, and still less, is it necessary to understand by it, as Prof. Stuart does, that the angels who presided over the earth, over the under-world, and over the sea, are intended. It is evidently popular language; and the sense is, that John heard a universal ascription of praise. All worlds seemed to join in it; all the dwellers on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea, partook of the spirit of heaven in rendering honor to the Redeemer.<p>Under the earth - Supposed to be inhabited by the shades of the dead. See the <a href="//biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a> notes; <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a> note.<p>And such as are in the sea - All that dwell in the ocean. In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/148-7.htm">Psalm 148:7-10</a>, "dragons, and all deeps; beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl," are called on to praise the Lord; and there is no more incongruity or impropriety in one description than in the other. In the Psalm, the universe is called on to render praise; in the passage before us it is described as actually doing it. The hills, the streams, the floods; the fowls of the air, the dwellers in the deep, and the beasts that roam over the earth; the songsters in the grove, and the insects that play in the sunbeam, in fact, declare the glory of their Creator; and it requires no very strong effort of the fancy to imagine the universe as sending up a constant voice of thanksgiving.<p>Blessing, and honour, ... - There is a slight change here from <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>, but it is the same thing substantially. It is an ascription of all glory to God and to the Lamb. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

As John wishes to state how finally “every creature (<span class="greekheb">πᾶν κτίσμα</span>) unites in the hymns of praise which have thus far been heard,—and that, too, so that now praise and honor are proclaimed alike to the enthroned God and the Lamb, and consequently, the hymns of praise from the two chs. 4 and 5 are united in an overpowering harmony,[1968]—he expressly mentions the four great “regions of the creation,”[1969] the whole of which he wishes to represent, just as in <a href="/psalms/146-6.htm" title="Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keeps truth for ever:">Psalm 146:6</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Php 2:11</a>, the entire creation is described in its three chief departments.

Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>), by a sweep of the poet’s imagination, even departed spirits and sea-monsters (<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θαλ</span>., rather than seafaring men) join—“even all that is in” earth and sea and heaven (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the title of the sun in the Rosetta inscription of 196 B.C.’ <span class="greekheb">μέγας βασιλεὺς τῶν τε ἄνω κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κάτω χωρῶν</span>). Sacrifice is on the throne of the universe; by dying for men, Jesus has won the heart and confidence of the world. Thus the praise of God the creator (ch. 4) and the praise of Jesus the redeemer (ch. 5) blend in one final song, whose closing words indicate that the latter’s prestige was not confined to a passing phase of history. The crime for which the messiah dethrones the rulers (in Enoch xlvi.) is just “because they do not praise and extol him, nor thankfully acknowledge whence the kingdom was bestowed upon them, … because they do not extol the name of the Lord of Spirits”. In the papyrus of Ani (<span class="ital">E. B. D.</span> 3) Râ is worshipped by the gods “who dwell in the heights and who dwell in the depths”; whilst Isis and Osiris, as possessing supreme power, received honour “in the regions under the earth and in those above ground” (Plut. <span class="ital">de Iside</span>, 27). Compare the fine rabbinic saying of Rabbi Pinchas and R. Jochanan on <a href="/psalms/100-2.htm" title="Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.">Psalm 100:2</a> : “though all offerings cease in the future, the offering of praise alone shall not cease; though all prayers cease, thanksgiving alone shall not cease”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">every creature</span>] Cf. <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Php 2:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">under the earth</span>] See on <span class="ital"><a href="/revelation/5-3.htm" title="And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.">Revelation 5:3</a></span>. It seems harsh to understand the words of an <span class="ital">unwilling</span> cooperation of the devils in glorifying God and His Son, besides that Judges 6 seems hardly to prove that <span class="ital">all</span> fallen spirits are yet confined “under the earth:” <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm" title="And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?">Matthew 8:29</a> compared with <a href="/luke/8-31.htm" title="And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.">Luke 8:31</a> suggests the contrary. It is more possible to suppose the dead, even the holy dead, to be described as “under the earth.” In Enoch lxii. we have a hymn, somewhat resembling those of this Book, actually sung by the souls of the lost—apparently in the intervals of their suffering. The souls of the Martyrs appear from this Book to be in Heaven, <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a> sqq.: but we cannot be sure that this is true of all the faithful, and it is not certain that a disembodied soul can be said, except figuratively, to be in any place at all: so that the place where their bodies lie is perhaps the only place where the dead can properly be said to be.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">such as are in the sea</span>] Read simply <span class="bld">on the sea</span>: including those in ships, and marine animals: see <a href="/psalms/104-26.htm" title="There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom you have made to play therein.">Psalm 104:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Blessing, and honour</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">the blessing, and the honour</span>, &c.—the art. being repeated with each noun, not, as in the preceding verse, standing once for all.

Watts’ “Blessings <span class="ital">more than we can give</span>” is a perfectly legitimate developement of the sense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πᾶν κτίσμα</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτοῖς</span>, <span class="ital">every creature</span>—<span class="ital">in them</span>) <span class="ital">All the works of the Lord in all places of His dominion:</span> <a href="/psalms/103-22.htm" title="Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.">Psalm 103:22</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">πάντας ἤκουσα λέγοντας</span>) This reading is supported by the greater number of copies.[71] A few have changed <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span>, or even <span class="greekheb">λέγοντας</span>, into the neuter. <span class="greekheb">Τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς</span> is put absolutely, as ch. <a href="/revelation/10-6.htm" title="And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:">Revelation 10:6</a>.

Those <span class="accented">under the earth</span> are probably the <span class="accented">"spirits</span> in prison" of <a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>, though Vitringa understands the expression to be used of the devils <span class="accented">"who</span> unwillingly obey Christ," and even declare his glory, as in <a href="/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>, "I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God." <span class="accented">The sea</span> is meant literally; the apostle's object being to include all animated beings wheresoever existing. It has been remarked that St. John's exile at Patmos would render him familiar with the appearance of the sea, and account for its frequent use in the Apocalypse, both literally and symbolically. The things on <span class="accented">the sea</span> would signify, not merely ships with their inhabitants, but also those animals in the sea which are known to men by dwelling near the surface. "All things that are in them" serves to render emphatic the universality of the description, as in <a href="/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a> and <a href="/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>, <span class="accented">"The</span> Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is." <span class="cmt_word">Heard I saying.</span> "Saying" is masculine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in 10, 13, P, Vulgate, Andr. <span class="accented">a, c</span>, Arethas, Primasius.

The Revisers have wisely rendered <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the dominion," by a different word from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "power," of ver. 12, both of which in the Authorized Version are rendered "power." The article, too, serves to give greater emphasis, making the expression tantamount to "all blessing," etc. (see on Revelation 4:11). Nothing is signified by the omission of three attributes. The number four is symbolical of the complete creation, and may be used on that account; but probably the omission is to avoid repetition, the four attributes given being typical of the seven just previously uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</span> That is, unto the Triune God (see on Revelation 4:2). Christ, as having part with the Father and the Holy Ghost in the Godhead, sits upon the throne, and is worthy with them to receive adoration. But in his special character as the Redeemer, he is also singled out to receive the praises of the redeemed. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Creature (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)<p>See <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>.
