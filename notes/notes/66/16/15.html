It reminds us not only that our Lord may come unexpectedly, but that He may even come and we be unaware. There is one day when He will come, and every eye will behold Him; but He comes in various ways and forms to bless and to test man. Blessed are they who are ready, watching. But vigilance is not enough: the garments must be kept. The powers of evil are abroad. Sloth and pleasure may counsel ease, and tempt the watcher to lay aside his garments and take rest and sleep. The earnest watcher desires, like St. Paul, to be found in Christ, clad in the true righteousness of faith (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/16-15.htm" title="Behold, I come as a thief.

Observe the beautiful abruptness; <span class="ital">I, </span>Jesus Christ. Hear him! Thus, when it is foretold that these evil agents will use great art and address in support of their bad cause, the Spirit of wisdom adds a useful caution, warning the faithful servants of Christ to be on their guard against the emissaries of hell, lest they should be deceived to their own destruction. <span class="ital">Blessed is he that watcheth — </span>That looks continually for him that <span class="ital">comes quickly; and keepeth his garments </span>on him — Which men usually put off when they sleep; that is, that keepeth himself clothed with the robe of righteousness, the garment of salvation; <span class="ital">lest he walk naked, and they see his shame </span>— Lest he lose the graces which he takes no care to keep, and others see his sin and punishment. <span class="ital">And he gathered them together </span>— The true construction is, <span class="ital">And they gathered them together; </span>that is, the evil spirits and agents, before mentioned, gather all the forces of the Popish princes together; <span class="ital">into a place called, in the Hebrew tongue, Armageddon </span>— That is, <span class="ital">the mountain of destruction. </span>Mageddon, or Megiddo, is a place frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, well known in ancient times for many memorable occurrences; in particular, the slaughter of the kings of Canaan, related <a href="/judges/5-19.htm" title="The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.">Jdg 5:19</a>.

Or, take it for Rome, as mystical Babylon, the name of Babylon being put for Rome, which was meant, but was not then to be directly named. When Rome is destroyed, her river and merchandise must suffer with her. And perhaps a way will be opened for the eastern nations to come into the church of Christ. The great dragon will collect all his forces, to make one desperate struggle before all be lost. God warns of this great trial, to engage his people to prepare for it. These will be times of great temptation; therefore Christ, by his apostle, calls on his professed servants to expect his sudden coming, and to watch that they might not be put to shame, as apostates or hypocrites. However Christians differ, as to their views of the times and seasons of events yet to be brought to pass, on this one point all are agreed, Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, will suddenly come again to judge the world. To those living near to Christ, it is an object of joyful hope and expectation, and delay is not desired by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, I come as a thief - That is, suddenly and unexpectedly. See the <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a> note; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> note. This is designed evidently to admonish people to watch, or to be in readiness for his coming, since, whenever it would occur, it would be at a time when people were not expecting him.<p>Blessed is he that watcheth - Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>. The meaning here is, that he who watches for these events, who marks the indications of their approach, and who is conscious of a preparation for them, is in a better and happier state of mind than he on whom they come suddenly and unexpectedly.<p>And keepeth his garments - The allusion here seems to be to one who, regardless of danger, or of the approach of an enemy, should lay aside his garments and lie down to sleep. Then the thief might come and take away his garments, leaving him naked. The essential idea, therefore, here, is the duty of vigilance. We are to be awake to duty and to danger; we are not to be found sleeping at our post; we are to be ready for death - ready for the coming of the Son of man.<p>Lest he walk naked - His raiment being carried away while he is asleep.<p>And they see his shame - Compare the notes on <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>. The meaning here is, that, as Christians are clothed with the garments of righteousness, they should not lay them aside, so that their spiritual nakedness should be seen. They are to be always clothed with the robes of salvation; always ready for any event, however soon or suddenly it may come upon them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

The mention of that day, and perhaps the knowledge that the battle is a daily one (see on ver. 14), naturally leads to the solemn warning given here. It is worth notice how St. John adopts this idea; and this of itself should suffice to demonstrate the incorrectness of endeavoring to compute the times and seasons, as has been done by so many Apocalyptic writers (cf. also <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</span> The same figure again as in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>.
