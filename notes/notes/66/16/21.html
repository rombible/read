The details and the consequences of that overthrow are more fully stated in the subsequent chapters. The fulfillment of what is here stated will be found, according to the method of interpretation proposed, in the ultimate overthrow of the papacy. The process described in this chapter is that of successive calamities that would weaken it and prepare it for its fall; then a rallying of its dying strength; and then some tremendous judgment that is compared with a storm of hail, accompanied with lightning, and thunder, and an earthquake, that would completely overthrow all that was connected with it, We are not, indeed, to suppose that this will literally occur; but the fair interpretation of prophecy leads us to suppose that that formidable power will, at no very distant period, be overthrown in a manner that would be well represented by such a fearful storm. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. fell&#8212;Greek, "descends."<p>upon men&#8212;Greek, "the men."<p>and men blasphemed God&#8212;not those struck who died, but the rest.

Which must be understood not as after the fall of the cities, and the flight of the islands and mountains, but at the same time; and it looks as if such men that shall escape at the battle of Armageddon, that hail stones from heaven will fall upon them and destroy them; just as the kings of the Amorites and their men were killed by hail stones, cast down by the Lord from heaven, as they fled before Joshua, when more were killed by the stones than were slain by the sword, <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a> the allusion seems to be to the plague of hail in <a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a><p>every stone about the weight of a talent; which is threescore pound weight, a prodigious weight indeed for a single hailstone! such hail stones were never known to fall; the largest I have read of is what Caspar Wesserus assured Mr. Broughton (f) of, at Zurich, which being brought from a field afar off, to the consul, and so must melt in carriage, yet weighed a pound. It may be said of this hail storm, as of the earthquake in a preceding verse, that it will be such as never was since men were upon earth; and denotes the sore, heavy, and even intolerable judgments of God upon the antichristian party: God's judgments are sometimes signified by hail storms, <a href="/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a> and particularly the judgments upon Gog and Magog, <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a> which may respect the same as here: the Jews (g) now expect a great hail in the times of Gog and Magog: <p>and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; the plague of hail brought down the hard heart of Pharaoh, and humbled him, so that he acknowledged his wickedness, and the sin of his people, and owned the justice of God; but this more terrible storm will have no effect upon these men, to convince and reform them, but, on the contrary, they will break out into blasphemy against God, who caused it to fall on them; it will have the same effect as the fourth and fifth vials: <p>for the plague thereof was exceeding great; it must beat down all before it, and be intolerable: whether this hail storm may not also have some regard to coldness and lukewarmness, as Naplet suggests, and so may point at the close of the spiritual reign of Christ, or the Laodicean state, which will bring on the second coming of Christ, and so this effect of the seventh vial will end where the seven churches and seven trumpets do, may be considered; See Gill on <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>. <p>(f) See his (Zohar's) Works, p. 491.

In En. lx. 17 the “spirit of the hail is a good angel,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, amenable to God’s orders.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The obscurity of chapter 17 springs mainly from the differences of tradition and outlook which are reflected in the canonical text. The threefold interpretation of the Beast as the Imperial power (so 13), as Nero redivivus (<a href="/revelation/16-8.htm" title="And the fourth angel poured out his vial on the sun; and power was given to him to scorch men with fire.">Revelation 16:8</a>) and as (11) the eighth king (the two latter being applications of the same idea) is accompanied by a twofold explanation of the seven heads (geographical = 9, historical =10), and of the woman’s support (<a href="/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-3.htm" title="And the second angel poured out his vial on the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.">Revelation 16:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm" title="Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.">Revelation 16:15</a>). The eschatological tradition of Babylon as the supreme anti-divine world-power is applied to Rome, and this involves the reinterpretation of some details (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> 15, 18), while the tradition of the Beast as antichrist is further overlaid by the special tradition of Nero redivivus in that capacity. This dual Beast (as Völtei first recognised; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Charles’s <span class="ital">Ascensio Isaiæ</span>, pp. lx.–lxi.) is not merely the Imperial power (as in <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm" title="And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.">Revelation 13:3</a>) but incarnate in an Imperial personality of infernal and supernatural character, which attacks not only the Christian messiah (14) but Rome itself (<a href="/context/revelation/16-16.htm" title="And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon....">Revelation 16:16-17</a>). The latter trait is unmistakably due to the legend of Nero redivivus, apart from which the oracle is unintelligible. Such variations have left traces in the structure of the passage, which point to some process of editorial revision, but it is difficult to disentangle the original source or sources, or even to determine their precise character and period. <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm" title="For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.">Revelation 16:14</a> is certainly out of place, for the allies of the Beast could not destroy Rome after they themselves had been destroyed by the messiah and his allies. It is thus either proleptic or inserted by the Christian writer in his (Jewish) source (so <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Vischer, Charles, Briggs, von Soden). Other traces of this editor might be found in 6 b, 8 (9 a?), and 15, and the Jewish character of the source (so Vischer, Weyland, Schmidt, Sabatier, Ménégoz, etc.), would be confirmed by the absence of any polemic against the Imperial cultus. It would be a Vespasianic oracle, inspired by a passion for revenge on Rome for her cruel, recent treatment of the Jewish people. When the source is regarded as Christian (as <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by Erbes, Völter, and Schön), <a href="/revelation/16-11.htm" title="And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.">Revelation 16:11</a> would be an addition inserted under Domitian to bring it up to date (so Harnack, <span class="ital">Texte u. Unters.</span> II. iii. 134 f.; <span class="ital">Chronologie</span>, 245, 246, followed by Briggs, Gunkel, J. Weiss, etc.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Introd. § 7). But even so, the structure of the passage is involved. <a href="/context/revelation/16-9.htm" title="And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which has power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory....">Revelation 16:9-11</a> are not vision but calculation or exposition (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm" title="Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred three score and six.">Revelation 13:18</a>). The <span class="ital">waters</span> of <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm" title="Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.">Revelation 16:15</a> are never seen (cf. <a href="/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-3.htm" title="And the second angel poured out his vial on the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.">Revelation 16:3</a>), and the professed explanation (<a href="/revelation/16-7.htm" title="And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.">Revelation 16:7</a>) follows a loose order (beast = 8, heads = 9–11, horns=12–14, waters = 15, horns again = 16–17, and finally the woman = 18). The reference to the woman, however, is thrown late in order to introduce the following doom-song (<span class="ital">cf. kings</span> in 18, <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm" title="For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.">Revelation 18:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm" title="And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall mourn her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,">Revelation 18:9</a>, and <span class="ital">great</span> in 18, <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>), and a similar motive accounts for the irregular position of 16–17 after 14, Rome’s fall, though viewed from different angles, being the main object before the writer’s mind at the moment. The defeat of 14 is taken up, in its true position, afterwards (<a href="/context/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war....">Revelation 19:11-21</a>). <a href="/revelation/16-15.htm" title="Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.">Revelation 16:15</a> (an echo of <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a> b) is probably thrown in at this point, to contrast dramatically the revolt [16] of Rome’s supporters against her. Thus, except for 9–11, there are sufficient psychological reasons to account partially for the order and contents of the oracle; but source-criticism is required to clear up the passage, in the more or less extensive theories of one source (edited in 6, 9 <span class="ital">a</span>, 14–15, so J. Weiss; or variously in 8, 12–14, with some words in 6, 9, 11, so <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Pfleiderer, Baljon, Bousset and Forbes) or even two sources (Jewish, A = 3–4, 6–7<span class="ital">b</span>, 10, [919]=11–13, 16 <span class="ital">b</span>–17, Wellhausen’s <span class="ital">Analyse</span>, 26 f.), for which the linguistic idiosyncrasies (double use of <span class="greekheb">γέμειν</span>, 3–4, precedence of object over verb 13, 16, 18, <span class="greekheb">οἱ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γ</span>. 2, and the construction <span class="greekheb">βλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἦν</span>, 8) afford some basis. The main problem is to explain how the various strata of tradition overlap; <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in 8, 12 f., the beast is Nero redivivus, an infernal power of evil, whereas in 11 Domitian seems identified with Nero the beast. It is hard to believe that one and the same writer could simultaneously regard Domitian as a second Nero and expect Nero redivivus as a semi-supernatural power. In any case the stress falls on the Beast rather than on the woman, and on the eschatological prediction, not on the historical application. It is a fairly open question whether 8 or 11 is the editorial mortar super-imposed upon the earlier tradition. Upon the whole, one of the least unsatisfactory solutions is to take 11 as a Domitianic gloss by the Christian editor, who has also added 6 <span class="ital">b</span> (if not all of 6) and 14 to a Vespasianic oracle (possibly of Jewish origin) in <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm" title="And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:">Revelation 17:4</a> f. which anticipated the downfall of persecuting Rome at the hands of Nero redivivus and his Eastern allies. No hypothesis is free from difficulties. But the general Domitianic reference of the Apocalypse and the presence of the Nero redivivus saga must be worked in somehow, and some hypothesis on the above lines seems to do most justice to the literary structure of this chapter as well as to the data of the book in general. It is impossible to determine how far the Christian editor worked over his source. That the difficulties of the oracle arise mainly from the presence of an earlier source (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Introd. § 7), which John has revised slightly and brought up to date, is axiomatic, however.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[919] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The double object of the oracle is (<span class="ital">a</span>), by a re-editing of the tradition of 13 to represent Rome in her Imperial pride, before describing her downfall, and (<span class="ital">b</span>) to define more precisely the final appearance of the last foe. The chapter could readily be spared as isolated (Simcox), but this only proves that the author is again working upon disparate materials which he inherited. The oracle contains (<a href="/context/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth....">Revelation 16:1-6</a>) a vision of the Harlot (by way of foil to <a href="/context/revelation/12-1.htm" title="And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars:...">Revelation 12:1-6</a> and especially <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9</a> f.) and the Beast, with (<a href="/context/revelation/16-7.htm" title="And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments....">Revelation 16:7-18</a>) an explanation of the vision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/revelation/16-21.htm" title="And there fell on men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.">Revelation 16:21</a>.

Commentators usually quote 'Diodorus Siculus' (19:45), who mentions. as something marvellous, hailstones of a mina in weight; the mina being one-sixtieth of a talent; and also the account of Josephus, who speaks of stones a talent in weight being thrown by machines at the siege of Jerusalem (see Wetstein, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>). "The men," though not pointing to any particular group of men who have been definitely mentioned, nevertheless necessarily refers to the wicked, were are the object of this punishment. "Hail" is frequently mentioned as a judgment of God and is added here to heighten the general effect of the description (cf. <a href="/exodus/9.htm">Exodus 9</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-32.htm">Psalm 105:32</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-30.htm">Isaiah 30:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-17.htm">Haggai 2:17</a>; also <a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great;</span> <span class="accented">is exceeding great</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). As in ver. 9, men repent not. Like Pharaoh, their hearts are hardened. These words end the general description of the vial judgments, but the events alludes to under the seventh vial are elaborated and particularized in the chapters which follow; the whole concluding at the end of <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hail<p>See <a href="/exodus/9-18.htm">Exodus 9:18</a>.<p>Every stone about the weight of a talent (&#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)<p>The adjective, meaning of a talent's weight, agrees with hail; hail of a talent's weight; i.e., having each stone of that weight.
