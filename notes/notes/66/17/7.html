It was a seat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form, which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupid and blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within its influence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads, seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings, seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast, directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry again. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yet no kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken; but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ must reign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victory is, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme dominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare, are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? - He was doubtless struck with the appearance of John as he stood fixed in astonishment. The question asked him, "why" he wondered, was designed to show him that the cause of his surprise would be removed or lessened, for that he would proceed so to explain this that he might have a correct view of its design.<p>I will tell thee the mystery of the woman - On the word "mystery," see the notes on <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>. The sense is, "I will explain what is meant by the symbol - the hidden meaning that is couched under it." That is, he would so far explain it that a just view might be obtained of its signification. The explanation follows, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8-18</a>.<p>And of the beast that carrieth her, ... - <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. martyrs&#8212;witnesses.<p>I wondered with great admiration&#8212;As the Greek is the same in the verb and the noun, translate the latter "wonder." John certainly did not admire her in the modern English sense. Elsewhere (Re 17:8; 13:3), all the earthly-minded ("they that dwell on the earth") wonder in admiration of the beast. Here only is John's wonder called forth; not the beast, but the woman sunken into the harlot, the Church become a world-loving apostate, moves his sorrowful astonishment at so awful a change. That the world should be beastly is natural, but that the faithful bride should become the whore is monstrous, and excites the same amazement in him as the same awful change in Israel excited in Isaiah and Jeremiah. "Horrible thing" in them answers to "abominations" here. "Corruptio optimi pessima"; when the Church falls, she sinks lower than the godless world, in proportion as her right place is higher than the world. It is striking that in Re 17:3, "woman" has not the article, "the woman," as if she had been before mentioned: for though identical in one sense with the woman, Re 12:1-6, in another sense she is not. The elect are never perverted into apostates, and still remain as the true woman invisibly contained in the harlot; yet Christendom regarded as the woman has apostatized from its first faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The angel promiseth to open this vision, it being the key of the former vision, and is the only vision expounded throughout this whole book. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the angel said unto me,....

I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns....">Revelation 17:7-14</a>. The question of the angel, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τί ἐθαύμασας</span>, introduces the intended interpretation just as the question of the elders (<a href="/revelation/7-13.htm" title="And one of the elders answered, saying to me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and from where came they?">Revelation 7:13</a>), only that here the angel expects no answer whatever of John, but immediately himself promises: <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ ἐρῶ σοι τὸ μυστήριον</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. This announcement marks that the two chief forms, the woman and the beast, which of course are explained each by themselves,—as they symbolize subjects that are actually different, the world-<span class="ital">city</span> and the world-<span class="ital">kingdom</span>,—nevertheless belong together essentially; there is but <span class="ital">one</span> mystery, the mystery “of the woman and of the beast.” Although the woman and the beast are distinguished, the present description remains, therefore, in essential agreement with that of ch 13. Nevertheless, the inner connection between the woman and the beast is expressed by the fact that the woman is seated upon the beast, (<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βασταζ αὐτ</span>., cf. <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a>.) In perfect harmony with this is the circumstance that the beast is first (<a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>) explained, and only then, that which is more special, which is first received from that further conception, the form of the woman.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of the beast which John saw (<a href="/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a> sqq.), it is said: <span class="greekheb">ἡν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν καὶ μέλλει ἀναβαίνειν ἐκ τῆς ἀβύσσου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and this is again expressed as a foundation for the astonishment of the inhabitants of the earth:[3848] <span class="greekheb">ἡν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν καὶ πάρεσται</span>. This summary <span class="greekheb">πάρεσται</span>—which simply means “shall be,” but in which an intimation of a <span class="ital">parousia</span> of the beast, to be opposed to the <span class="ital">parousia</span> of the Lord,[3849] dare be sought the less as the expression <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span> is lacking in the Apoc.—briefly comprehends what was previously described in such a way that also the last end of the beast again coming forth might be designated therewith (<span class="greekheb">καὶ μέλλει ἀναβ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπαγει</span>). Finally, the important point of the interpretation—which, of course, is not itself without mystery, but is given after the manner of <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm" title="Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred three score and six.">Revelation 13:18</a>, because of which, also, just as there, the allusion (<a href="/revelation/17-9.htm" title="And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.">Revelation 17:9</a>) is justified, in that it here pertains to an understanding endowed with wisdom—recurs for the third time in <a href="/revelation/17-11.htm" title="And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.">Revelation 17:11</a>, where, notwithstanding the more minute determination that the beast is to return in the person of a true king, yet the identity of the subject is unmistakably designated by the formulas <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἡν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν</span> and <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰς ἀπώλειαν ὑπάγει</span>. That explanation, therefore, is utterly mistaken, which understands the beast (<a href="/revelation/17-11.htm" title="And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.">Revelation 17:11</a>) differently from in <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a> (and <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a>); in no way is the distinction possible that <span class="greekheb">τὸ θηρίον</span> is at one time Satan himself, and directly afterwards antichrist.[3850] For the more accurate explanation of the subject; see on <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-18.htm" title="And the woman which you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.">Revelation 17:18</a>. In phraseology, the genitive <span class="greekheb">βλεπόντων</span> in <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a> is remarkable. Entirely similar is the construction neither of <a href="/luke/8-20.htm" title="And it was told him by certain which said, Your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to see you.">Luke 8:20</a>,—where the absolute gen. <span class="greekheb">λεγόντων</span> is in meaning construed with the impersonal <span class="greekheb">ἀπηγγέλη</span>,—nor of <a href="/matthew/1-18.htm" title="Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:18</a>,[3851] where the absolute genitive construction <span class="greekheb">μνηστευθείσης τῆς μητρός</span> precedes, and then, by a variation of construction, the subject is derived entirely from the first member (<span class="greekheb">εὑρέθη ἐν γαστρὶ ἕχουσα</span>), which is not modified by the parenthetical limitation <span class="greekheb">πρὶν ἤ συνελθεἰν αὐτους</span>. In this passage, however, the definite subject <span class="greekheb">οί κατοικοῦντες</span> precedes, and the clause <span class="greekheb">βλεπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θηρ</span>. explains what is predicated of those <span class="greekheb">κατοικοῦντες</span> (<span class="greekheb">θαυμασθήσονται</span>), so that, according to the symmetry of the construction, only the nom. <span class="greekheb">βλἑποντες</span> can be expected; but the gen. is occasioned by the gen. parenthetical clause <span class="greekheb">ὡν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., even though it dare not also be said that the <span class="greekheb">βλεπόντων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is expressly construed into the relative clause.[3852] The nearest indication given within ch. 17,—which is also in harmony with ch. 13,—for the understanding of what is said concerning the beast in <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a> (and <a href="/revelation/17-11.htm" title="And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.">Revelation 17:11</a>), lies in <a href="/revelation/17-9.htm" title="And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.">Revelation 17:9</a> sq., where the seven heads of the beast are interpreted: “The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth, and there are seven kings.”[3853] The seven heads, therefore, which in <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a> sqq.,—where they appeared adorned with crowns,—indicated royal sovereigns, receive here a twofold reference:[3854] thereby both seven mountains and seven kings are to be understood. In connection with the heads appearing here without crowns, the first reference is without difficulty; while the other to the seven kings, which indeed is not indicated here by crowns, nevertheless finds an essentially identical foundation with <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a> sqq. in the description of the regal magnificence of the woman who sits upon the beast with seven heads. But at the same time, the reference to the seven mountains on which the woman sits serves to interpret the mystery of the woman and of the beast; for if, by the woman, the <span class="ital">city</span> mistress of the world (<a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>), of the Gentile empire forcing all inhabitants of the earth beneath her, be meant, and this city is designated as lying on seven hills, this significant point of the interpretation can be referred only to “the seven-hilled city,” to Rome, just as what is said (<a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space....">Revelation 17:10-11</a>) concerning the relations of the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεῖς</span>, in complete harmony with <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a> sqq., applies only to the Roman rulers of the world. Mysteriously, therefore, as this interpretation sounds, yet the first reference of the seven heads to the seven well-known mountains has been made prominent with the manifest intent to actually attest the interpretation promised in <a href="/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Accordingly the seven hills are not themselves taken into further consideration; the interpretation stops (<a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a> sq.) with the seven kings. The transferal, already mentioned on <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a> sqq., of the textual idea of seven <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΣΙΛΕῖς</span></span></span>, i.e., of seven <span class="ital">persons</span> who possess a kingdom, and that, too, the dominion of the world, to that of seven kingdoms or phases of the dominion of the world, depends, in Andr. and Beda, as well as in Hofmann, Ebrard, Hengstenb., and Auberlen,[3855] upon the presumption that the “temporal-historical” explanation of Hammond, Grot., Wetstein, Eichhorn, Ewald, Lücke, De Wette, Bleek, etc., removes the biblical conception of Apocalyptic prophecy.[3856] That this opposition is justified in <span class="ital">one</span> chief point, has been already referred to on <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm" title="And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.">Revelation 13:3</a>; but exegetically incorrect, and without foundation in a further theological respect to the idea of prophetical inspiration, is the opposition to the acknowledgment of the fact that the entire force of the context allows the <span class="greekheb">βασιλείς</span> to be regarded only as concrete personalities, and then, that the form in general of the antichristian world-power hovering before the prophetic gaze is that of the heathen-Roman Empire. The first has been correctly understood, e.g., by Coccejus, whom Auberlen certainly will not accuse of the “temporal-historical” exposition of the Apoc., and has turned it to the advantage of his “ecclesiastical-historical” exposition: “The seven kings,” says Coccejus, “are the primates of the churches of Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, Rome, France, and Spain.” On the other hand, however, many “temporal-historical” expositors cross over into the sphere of the “ecclesiastical-historical,” by finding, especially in <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-16.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.">Revelation 17:16</a>, predictions concerning the incursions of the Goths, etc.[3857] That the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΣΙΛΕῖς ἙΠΤΆ</span></span></span> are actually, as the expression declares,[3858] seven persons invested with the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία</span>, results especially from the description, <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a> (<span class="greekheb">οἱ πέντε</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ εἶς</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄλλος</span>), and most of all from <a href="/revelation/17-11.htm" title="And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.">Revelation 17:11</a>, since here the entire sense depends upon the fact that the still future eight kings are contemplated as the <span class="ital">human-personal</span> manifestation of the whole beast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Five of the seven kings “are fallen,” i.e., dead; “the one,” therefore the sixth in the series, “is,” i.e., he at present possesses the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία</span>, “the other,” therefore the last of the seven, “is not yet come,” he is not yet in possession of the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία</span>, he has not yet made his appearance as <span class="greekheb">βασιλεύς</span>: but he shall come as the seventh, “and when he cometh,[3859] he must continue a short space;” i.e., his dominion shall soon come to an end.[3860] But the seventh is followed by yet another, the eighth (<a href="/revelation/17-11.htm" title="And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.">Revelation 17:11</a>), who cannot be symbolized by a particular head on the beast,[3861] because, although connected with the seven (<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ἑπτά ὲστιν</span>), yet he has a different position from all those; he is not as one in their series, but in his person is the embodiment of the beast himself; he himself is the one in whom the beast rising out of the abyss,[3862] which now “is not,” shall again appear, of which also it shall then be said, just as <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a> of the beast as such: <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀπώλειαν ὑπάγει</span>, i.e., by the judgment at the Lord’s coming, he shall be delivered to everlasting destruction, and thus with him, then, the beast himself shall perish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Before the expressions made in <a href="/context/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is....">Revelation 17:8-11</a> concerning the beast and the seven (eight) kings are explained by their combination with one another, and with what is contained in <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a> sqq., the meaning of the phrase <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἑπτά ἐστιν</span> must be established. Hengstenb.’s explanation is incorrect: “His fate is that of the seven, viz., he must fall, he goes to ruin.” Too general is the explanation that the eighth—the eighth kingdom, as it is said—is to be of the same nature as the seven.[3863] But, on the other hand, the explanation which forms a decisive point in Ewald, De Wette, Volkm., Hilgenf., and the other expositors, who in the eighth king recognize the returned Nero,[3864] is not compatible with the words of the text. The formula <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ἑπτά ἐστιν</span> is supposed to declare: “He is one of the seven.” He has thus, and that, too, as one of the five fallen, already once existed, and shall return as a true king.[3865] But the more peculiar the idea, the more necessary would its unambiguous expression have been; and this would have been very easy to John; he would have written, according to the linguistic usage altogether customary with him,[3866] <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἶς ἐκ τῶν ἑπτά ἐστιν</span>. The fable of the return of Nero, which, in its actual foundations, must be regarded as far removed from <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm" title="And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.">Revelation 13:3</a>, is also here unjustified in a simply exegetical respect. Grot., has shown the correct way,[3867] by explaining the <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ἑπτά ἐστιν</span> with a comparison of <a href="/romans/9-10.htm" title="And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;">Romans 9:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm" title="And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;">Matthew 1:3</a>; <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/revelation/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel?

Though the seer cannot fully comprehend the terrible significance of the sign he sees, viz. that a portion of the Church is one with the hostile world (see on ver. 6), yet there are sufficient marks wherewith to identify it. The woman, the wilderness, the reliance upon the world power, the inscription, the similar description of Judah in <a href="/jeremiah/2.htm">Jeremiah 2</a> and 3. (see on ver. 6), might have made the interpretation plain. <span class="cmt_word">I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns;</span> <span class="accented">the ten horns</span> (cf. ver. 5, which declares that this essential unity is a <span class="accented">mystery</span>). Observe, too, that the "mystery of the woman and of the beast" is all one. (On the "beast," "the seven heads," and "the ten horns." see on previous verses, especially <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>.) In ver. 1 the harlot is said to sit on the waters; here the beast carries her. The two statements are really identical; both the beast and the waters represent the worldly power found among "peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues" (ver. 14). </body></html>
