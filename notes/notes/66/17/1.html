Babylon was the great city, whose splendour dazzled, and whose power destroyed Jerusalem (<a href="/context/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1-8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm" title="And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm" title="That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How has the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!">Isaiah 14:4</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/14-13.htm" title="For you have said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also on the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/47-5.htm" title="Sit you silent, and get you into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.">Isaiah 47:5-8</a>). Against Babylon the voices of the prophets were lifted up (<a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm" title="And, behold, here comes a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken to the ground.">Isaiah 21:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm" title="Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, said the LORD, which destroy all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.">Jeremiah 51:25</a>); she seemed to them the embodiment of splendid vice and resistless power; “the glory of kingdoms,” “the golden city,” “who exalted her throne above the stars of God,” “who sat as a lady given to pleasures, and flattering herself that she would see no sorrow.” In her greatness and her hostility to Jerusalem she became a type of later world-powers; and, in St. John’s vision, Babylon, in her purple and her pomp, in her luxurious ness and her tyranny, takes her place. And it is explained in the vision that Babylon is no longer the literal Babylon, but the power which has taken her place of pride and empire. That power was Rome. Rome was in St. John’s day just what Babylon had been in the days of the prophets—“the hammer of the whole earth,” the “golden cup that made all the earth drunken” (<a href="/jeremiah/50-23.htm" title="How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!">Jeremiah 50:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm" title="Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.">Jeremiah 51:7</a>; comp. <a href="/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a> of this chapter). At the same time, the way in which the Evangelist transfers to the Rome of his day the prophetic language which earlier prophets applied to ancient Babylon (compare these chapters, Revelation 17, 18, with Isaiah 47, <a href="/context/jeremiah/51-6.htm" title="Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.">Jeremiah 51:6-14</a>) ought to be sufficient to warn us against limited and local interpretations, even if the seven-headed wild beast did not show us that the world-power, like the moral principles of which Babylon and Rome were examples, is not confined to one age. If we remember this, we shall see that the Babylon of the Apocalypse, while, undoubtedly, Pagan Rome, cannot be limited to it. Is it, then, the question must be asked, Papal Rome? The answer is: In so far as Papal Rome has wielded tyrant power, turned persecutor, stood between the spirits of men and Christ, depraved men’s consciences, withheld the truth, connived at viciousness, sought aggrandisement, and been a political engine rather than a witness for the righteous King, she has inherited the features of Babylon. The recognition of these features led Dante to apply this very passage in the Apocalypse to Rome under the rule of worldly and tyrant popes, when he exclaimed to the shade of Nicholas III.

Neither was this an ordinary prostitute; she was <span class="ital">the great whore, with whom the kings of the earth, </span>both ancient and modern, <span class="ital">have committed fornication </span>— By partaking of her idolatry, and various kinds of wickedness. So Tyre is described, <a href="/isaiah/23-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.">Isaiah 23:17</a>, as <span class="ital">having committed fornication with all the kingdoms </span>of the world upon the face of <span class="ital">the earth. </span>Nay, not only the kings, but inferior persons, <span class="ital">the inhabiters of the earth, </span>the common people, <span class="ital">have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication </span>— No wine can more thoroughly intoxicate those who drink it, than false zeal does the followers of the great whore. Thus it was said of ancient Babylon, <span class="ital">The nations have drunk of her wine, therefore the nations are mad. </span>Fornication, in the usual style of Scripture, is idolatry; but if it be taken even literally, it is true that modern Rome openly allows the one as well as practises the other. Ancient Rome doth, in no respect, so well answer the character; for she ruled more with a rod of iron than with the wine of her fornication. Her ambition was for extending her empire, and not her religion. She permitted even the conquered nations to continue in the religion of their ancestors, and to worship their own gods after their own rituals. She may be said rather to have been corrupted by the importation of foreign vices and superstitions than to have established her own in other countries.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-6 Rome clearly appears to be meant in this chapter. Pagan Rome subdued and ruled with military power, not by art and flatteries. She left the nations in general to their ancient usages and worship. But it is well known that by crafty and politic management, with all kinds of deceit of unrighteousness, papal Rome has obtained and kept her rule over kings and nations. Here were allurements of worldly honour and riches, pomp and pride, suited to sensual and worldly minds. Prosperity, pomp, and splendour, feed the pride and lusts of the human heart, but are no security against the Divine vengeance. The golden cup represents the allurements, and delusions, by which this mystical Babylon has obtained and kept her influence, and seduced others to join her abominations. She is named, from her infamous practices, a mother of harlots; training them up to idolatry and all sorts of wickedness. She filled herself with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus. She intoxicated herself with it; and it was so pleasant to her, that she never was satisfied. We cannot but wonder at the oceans of Christian blood shed by men called Christians; yet when we consider these prophecies, these awful deeds testify to the truth of the gospel. And let all beware of a splendid, gainful, or fashionable religion. Let us avoid the mysteries of iniquity, and study diligently the great mystery of godliness, that we may learn humility and gratitude from the example of Christ. The more we seek to resemble him, the less we shall be liable to be deceived by antichrist.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials - See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/15-7.htm">Revelation 15:7</a>. Reference is again made to these angels in the same manner in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>, where one of them says that he would show to John "the bride, the Lamb's wife." No particular one is specified. The general idea seems to be, that to those seven angels was entrusted the execution of the last things, or the winding up of affairs introductory to the reign of God, and that the communications respecting those last events were properly made through them. It is clearly quite immaterial by which of these it is done. The expression "which had the seven vials," would seem to imply that though they had emptied the vials in the manner stated in the previous chapter, they still retained them in their hands.<p>And talked with me - Spake to me. The word "talk" would imply a more protracted conversation than occurred here.<p>Come hither - Greek, &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;  deuro - "Here, hither." This is a word merely calling the attention, as we should say now, "Here." It does not imply that John was to leave the place where he was.<p>I will shew unto thee - Partly by symbols, and partly by express statements; for this is the way in which, in fact, he showed him.<p>The judgment - The condemnation and calamity that will come upon her.<p>Of the great whore - It is not uncommon in the Scriptures to represent a city under the image of a woman - a pure and holy city under the image of a virgin or chaste female; a corrupt, idolatrous, and wicked city under the image of an abandoned or lewd woman. See the notes on <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; "How is the faithful city become an harlot!" Compare the notes on <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-18.htm">Revelation 17:18</a>, it is expressly said that "this woman is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth" - that is, as I suppose, papal Rome; and the design here is to represent it as resembling an abandoned female - fit representative of an apostate, corrupt, unfaithful church. Compare the notes on <a href="/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>.<p>That sitteth upon many waters - An image drawn either from Babylon, situated on the Euphrates, and encompassed by the many artificial rivers which had been made to irrigate the country, or Rome, situated on the Tiber. In <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a> these waters are said to represent the peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues over which the government symbolized by the woman ruled. See the notes on that verse. Waters are often used to symbolize nations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 17<p>Re 17:1-18.

Satan having failed by violence, tries too successfully to seduce her by the allurements of the world; unlike her Lord, she was overcome by this temptation; hence she is seen sitting on the scarlet-colored beast, no longer the wife, but the harlot; no longer Jerusalem, but spiritually Sodom (Re 11:8).<span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:...">Revelation 17:1-4</a></span> John’s vision of the great whore, sitting upon the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>scarlet coloured beast, arrayed in<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>purple and scarlet, with a golden cup in her hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/17-5.htm" title="And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.">Revelation 17:5</a></span> Her name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/17-6.htm" title="And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.">Revelation 17:6</a></span> She is drunken with the blood of saints.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/17-7.htm" title="And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel?

But the angel first of all shows the harlot in her antichristian form,—which is necessary, because the special view of the city, in distinction from that of the empire as a whole, is, at least in this definite form, new,—and not until afterwards does the judgment occur (cf. <a href="/revelation/18-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.">Revelation 18:1</a> sqq.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς πόρνης τῆς μεγάλης</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

The special description of the city is prepared already by such passages as <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a>, <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>;[3802] but the city appears as a harlot, because to this applies what has previously been said concerning it as Babylon the great (cf, <a href="/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ ὑδάτων πολλῶν</span>.

The truth is, the Antichristian Empire is conceived as embodying the various forms of evil that existed in previous earthly empires. They have existed and become great, in virtue of what was <span class="ital">good</span> in them: (see St Augustine’s <span class="ital">City of God</span>, V. xii. 3, 5, xv. &c.; Epist. cxxxviii. 17: cf. Plat. <span class="ital">Rep.</span> I. xxiii. pp. 351–2); they are the divinely appointed protectors of God’s people (<a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm" title="And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall you have peace.">Jeremiah 29:7</a>; <a href="/context/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers.

The Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar had (as no one can read the Book of Daniel without seeing) something nobler in it than mere conquering pride, and to this nobler element Isaiah does justice: but St John sees (it does not follow that the natural man will see) that in the New Babylon the baser element is supreme.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But another interpretation has been suggested. In <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm" title="And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.">Revelation 12:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm" title="And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.">Revelation 12:14</a> we found that the Woman, the City of God and the Mother of His Son, fled into the wilderness, and there was concealed through the time of the Beast’s reign: and some have thought that the Woman in the Wilderness whom we meet with here is actually the same as the one we then parted with—the faithful City become an harlot (<a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This view is an unpleasant one, and seems out of harmony with the tone either of chap. 12 or of this chapter. But it is supported by the argument, that the image of a harlot is most frequently, in the O. T. used of the unfaithful City of God: <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm" title="How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm" title="For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when on every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.">Jeremiah 2:20</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm" title="They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 3:1</a> sqq., <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm" title="The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.">Jeremiah 3:6</a> sqq.; <a href="/ezekiel/16-23.htm" title="And it came to pass after all your wickedness, (woe, woe to you! said the LORD GOD;)">Ezekiel 16:23</a>; Hosea 1-3; <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="/micah/1-7.htm" title="And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.">Micah 1:7</a> : while it is applied to heathen cities only in Isaiah 23 fin.; <a href="/nahum/3-4.htm" title="Because of the multitude of the prostitutions of the well favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that sells nations through her prostitutions, and families through her witchcrafts.">Nahum 3:4</a>, already quoted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the other hand, in almost all those passages it is insisted on, more or less expressly, that the whoredoms of unfaithful Israel have the special guilt of <span class="ital">adultery</span>: and of that there is no hint here, the Lord does not say of Babylon as of Aholibah that she was “Mine.” This seems to destroy the parallel with the former nine cases, which moreover is less close, as regards the details of language, than that with the two latter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And further, the identification of the two Women is only possible on the assumption, that the Mother of chap. 12 is the true Christian Church, and the Harlot of this chapter the apostate Christian Church of Rome. Now we have seen reason to reject the former view: nor does the latter appear any more tenable. This subject is discussed in the Introduction: it may be enough to refer to St John’s own words in I <a href="/context/ephesians/4-2.htm" title="With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;...">Ephesians 4:2-3</a>, as proving that the spirit of the theology (whatever may be said of the political attitude) of the existing Roman Church is, on the whole, of God—that it certainly is <span class="ital">not</span> the spirit of Antichrist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Yet it is hardly necessary, if it be possible, to restrict the application of this chapter to the Pagan Rome of the past. ‘The kings of the earth have committed fornication’ with other cities since.

This and the following chapters (to <a href="/revelation/19-21.htm">Revelation 19:21</a>) consist of visions which are really included under the seventh vial, but which, on account of their length and elaboration, may be considered apart from the other judgments of that vial. In the preceding chapters we have had placed before us a conspectus of three classes of ungodly people, and the three principles of evil in their abstract form, as represented by the world (the first beast), the flesh (the second beast), and the devil (the dragon). The personal final overthrow of the devil is described in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. and 18, are devoted to the description of the judgments of the two former - the world, in its character of the openly hostile persecutor of the Church of God; and the other portion of the ungodly who, while still professing Christianity, find excuses for conforming to the worship of the image of the beast. The first beast is, therefore, identical with Babylon, and represents, as we have seen, the openly hostile and persecuting world power of all ages, of which, in St. John's time, Rome was the foremost embodiment. The second beast is identical with the harlot, and represents faithless Christians, the apostate portion of the Church. The very <span class="accented">raison d'etre</span> of the Apocalypse is to deal with these two forms of evil; to declare the overthrow of the one, and to warn and, if possible, reclaim those under the influence of the other. In the latter case, the warning consists in setting forth the judgment in store for faithless Christians; and as this is the course pursued with the former also, the two merge into one, and indeed are declared to be one. The apostle in substance declares that, though there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> difference between the two forms of ungodliness, there is in reality no distinction to be made, but both are involved in one common final judgment. He thus twice solemnly asserts that the harlot is Babylon (vers. 5 and 18). The comments upon the following chapters will be based upon this hypothesis, the reasons for which will be brought out more clearly as we proceed. The opening words of this chapter leave no doubt that the visions which follow are connected with the vial judgments. The "one of the seven angels" may be the seventh angel, to whom it pertained to unfold the circumstances connected with the last judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment.</span> <span class="accented">Hither</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;</span>, without the verb, as in <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a> and <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>. Though this particular narration necessarily takes place after the account of the vials, yet we are not to understand that the events here related are subsequent to these related in the concluding verses of the previous chapter. Note the remarkable similarity between these words and these of <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>, and the contrast between the bride, the wife of the Lamb, and the harlot who is connected with the beast.

In <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, and <a href="/nahum/3-14.htm">Nahum 3:14</a> the term refers to Tyre and Nineveh respectively. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There is an intended contrast between the bride and the Lamb, and the harlot who allies herself with the beast (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A contrast is also probably intended between the woman clothed with the sun (<a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>.), bringing forth the man child, Christ Jesus the Saviour - the representation of the pure Church - and the harlot clothed in scarlet, the mother of harlots and abominations - the representation of the faithless part of the Church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Both the woman of <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. and the harlot of this chapter reside in the wilderness, that is, this world (see on Revelation 12:14); indeed, they are to men sometimes indistinguishable (cf. the parable of the wheat and tares). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The faithful Church, the bride, is called a city (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 9, 10</a>); so the faithless portion of the Church, the harlot, is identified with the city Babylon (<a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4, 5</a>). Other coincidences will be noted as we proceed. But it seems equally impossible to accept the view that this faithless portion of the Church refers to papal Rome, <span class="accented">and none other.</span> We must include all the faithless of God's Church in all time. If the fulfilment is to be limited at all, it seems more reasonable to suppose that the first reference of St. John was to the faithless members of the seven Churches to which he addresses the Apocalypse. But we are, no doubt, intended to see here a picture of the position of the unfaithful part of the Church wherever it exists, at any time, and which men are certainly not able always to specify and judge. On this point see Professor Milligan's 'Baird Lectures' for 1885, on "The Revelation of St. John." In lect. 5. he says, "But Babylon is not the Church of Rome in particular. Deeply, no doubt, that Church has sinned. ... Yet the interpretation is false .... Babylon cannot be Christian Rome; and nothing has been more injurious to the Protestant Churches than the impression that the two were identical, and that, by withdrawing from communion with the pope, they wholly freed themselves from alliance with the spiritual harlot. Babylon embraces much more than Rome, and illustrations of what she is lie nearer our own door. Wherever professedly Christian men have thought the world's favour better than its reproach; wherever they have esteemed its honours a more desirable possession than its shame; wherever they have courted ease rather than welcomed suffering, have loved self indulgence rather than self sacrifice, and have substituted covetousness in grasping for generosity in distributing what they had, - there the spirit of Babylon has been manifested. In short, we have in the great harlot city neither the Christian Church as a whole, nor the Romish Church in particular, but all who anywhere within the Church profess to be Christ's 'little flock' and are not, denying in their lives the main characteristic by which they ought to be distinguished - that they 'follow' Christ." (For the distinction between the harlot and Babylon, see above.) <span class="cmt_word">That sitteth upon many waters</span>. "The" is inserted in B and other manuscripts, probably on account of the reference in ver. 15, but is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, P, and others. This is the description of Babylon in <a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>, whence, doubtless, the expression is derived. In the place quoted, the sentence refers to the many canals of Babylon; but the interpretation of this passage is given in ver. 15, where the <span class="accented">waters</span> are stated to be "peoples." This fact sufficiently demonstrates that, though the imagery of the Apocalypse be taken from the Old Testament, it is not always safe to insist on an exactly similar interpretation; the symbols employed may be applied in an independent manner. That the harlot sits on many waters therefore shows us that the faithless portion of the Church is to be found distributed amongst "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Sitteth upon many waters<p>Said of Babylon, <a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>; the wealth of Babylon being caused both by the Euphrates and by a vast system of canals. The symbol is interpreted by some commentators as signifying Babylon, by others pagan Rome, Papal Rome, Jerusalem. Dante alludes to this passage in his address to the shade of Pope Nicholas III., in the Bolgia of the Simonists.<p>"The Evangelist you pastors had in mind,<p>When she who sitteth upon many waters<p>To fornicate with kings by him was seen.<p>The same who with the seven heads was born,<p>And power and strength from the ten horns received,<p>So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing."<p>"Inferno," xix., 106-110. </body></html>
