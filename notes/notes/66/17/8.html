It is the same idolatrous power revived again; but only in another form; and all the corrupt part of mankind, whose names were not enrolled as good citizens in the registers of heaven, are pleased at the revival of it; but in this last form it <span class="ital">shall go into perdition </span>— It shall not, as it did before, cease for a time and revive again, but shall be destroyed for ever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After this general account of the beast, follows an explanation of the particular emblems, with a short preface, intimating that they are deserving of the deepest attention, and are a proper exercise and trial of the understanding. <span class="ital">Here is the mind which hath wisdom, </span><a href="/revelation/17-9.htm" title="And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.">Revelation 17:9</a> — As it was said upon a former occasion, <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>, <span class="ital">Here is wisdom: let him that hath understanding count, </span>&c. The <span class="ital">seven heads </span>have a double signification: they are, primarily, <span class="ital">seven mountains on which the woman sitteth </span>— On which the capital city is seated; which all know to be the situation of Rome. It is observed too, that new Rome, or Constantinople, is situated on seven mountains: but these are very rarely mentioned, and mentioned only by obscure authors in comparison of the others; and besides the seven mountains, other particulars also must coincide, which cannot be found in Constantinople. It is evident, therefore, that the city <span class="ital">seated on seven mountains </span>must be Rome; and a plainer description could not be given of it without expressing the name, which there might be several wise reasons for concealing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As <span class="ital">the seven heads </span>signify <span class="ital">seven mountains, </span>so they also signify <span class="ital">seven kings </span>reigning over them. <span class="ital">And </span>they <span class="ital">are seven kings </span>— Or <span class="ital">kingdoms, </span>or <span class="ital">forms of government, </span>as the word imports, and hath been shown to import in former instances. <span class="ital">Five are fallen </span>— Five of these forms of government are already past; <span class="ital">and one is </span>— The sixth is now subsisting. The <span class="ital">five fallen are kings, </span>and <span class="ital">consuls, </span>and <span class="ital">dictators, </span>and <span class="ital">decemvirs, </span>and <span class="ital">military tribunes with consular authority; </span>as they are enumerated and distinguished by the two greatest Roman historians, Livy and Tacitus. The <span class="ital">sixth </span>is the power of the <span class="ital">Cesars </span>or <span class="ital">emperors, </span>which was subsisting at the time of the vision. An end was put to the imperial name, A.D. 476, by Odoacer. king of the Heruli. He and his successors, the Ostrogoths, assumed the title of kings of Italy; but though the name was changed the power still continued much the same. This, therefore, cannot well be called a new form of government; it may rather be considered as a continuation of the imperial power, or as a renovation of the kingly authority. <span class="ital">Consuls </span>are reckoned but one form of government, though their office was frequently suspended, and after a time restored again: and in the same manner <span class="ital">kings </span>may be counted but one form of government, though the name was resumed after an interval of so many years. A new form of government was not erected till Rome fell under the obedience of the eastern emperor, and the emperor’s lieutenant, the exarch of Ravenna, dissolved all the former magistracies, and constituted a duke of Rome, to govern the people, and to pay tribute to the exarchate of Ravenna. Rome had never experienced this form of government before; and this was, perhaps, <span class="ital">the other </span>which, in the apostle’s days, <span class="ital">was not yet come, and when he cometh he must continue a short space </span>— For Rome was reduced to a dukedom, tributary to the exarch of Ravenna, by Longinus, who was sent exarch A.D. 566 or 568; and the city revolted from the eastern emperor to the pope, A.D. 727; which is <span class="ital">a short space, </span>in comparison of the imperial power, which preceded, and lasted above five hundred years; and in comparison of the Papal power, which followed, and hath now continued about one thousand years. But still it may be doubted whether this is properly a new form of government, Rome being still subject to the imperial power, by being subject to the Greek emperor’s deputy, the exarch of Ravenna: <span class="ital">and, </span>according as you determine this point, <span class="ital">the beast that was, and is not </span>— <span class="ital">Was, </span>while idolatrous, and <span class="ital">was not, </span>while not idolatrous, will appear to be <span class="ital">the seventh </span>or <span class="ital">eighth. </span>If you reckon this a new form of government, the beast that now is, is <span class="ital">the eighth; </span>if you do not reckon this a new form of government, the beast is <span class="ital">of the seven; </span>but whether he be the <span class="ital">seventh </span>or <span class="ital">eighth, </span>he is the last form of government, <span class="ital">and goeth into perdition </span>— It appears evidently that the sixth form of government, which was subsisting in St. John’s time, is the imperial; and what form of government hath succeeded to that in Rome, and hath continued for <span class="ital">a long space </span>of time, but the Papal? The beast, therefore, upon which the woman rideth, is the Roman government in its last form; and this, all must acknowledge, is the Papal, and not the imperial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Having thus explained the mystery of <span class="ital">the seven heads, </span>the angel proceeds to the explanation of <span class="ital">the ten horns, </span>(<a href="/context/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast....">Revelation 17:12-14</a>,) <span class="ital">which, </span>says he, are <span class="ital">ten kings, </span>who <span class="ital">have received no kingdom as yet </span>— And consequently they were not in being at the time of the vision; and indeed the Roman empire was not divided into ten kingdoms till some time after it was become Christian. <span class="ital">But </span>they <span class="ital">receive power as kings one hour </span>— Or rather, at the same time, or for the same length of time; <span class="ital">with the beast </span>— It is true in both senses, they rise and fall together with the beast; and consequently they are not to be reckoned before the rise and establishment of the beast. Kingdoms they might be before, but they were not before kingdoms or <span class="ital">horns </span>of the beast, till they embraced his religion, and submitted to his authority; and the beast strengthened them, as they again strengthened the beast. It is upon the seventh or last head of the beast that the horns were seen growing together, that is, upon the Roman empire in its seventh or last form of government; and they are not, like the <span class="ital">heads, </span>successive, but contemporary kingdoms. <span class="ital">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast, </span><a href="/revelation/17-13.htm" title="These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength to the beast.">Revelation 17:13</a> — Which is easily understood and applied to the princes and states in communion with the Church of Rome. However they may differ in other respects, yet they agree in submitting implicitly to the authority of the Roman Church, and in defending its rights and prerogatives against all opposers. But where were ever ten kings or kingdoms who were all unanimous in their submissions to the Roman empire, and voluntarily contributed <span class="ital">their power and strength, </span>their forces and riches, to support and maintain it? <span class="ital">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, </span><a href="/revelation/17-14.htm" title="These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.">Revelation 17:14</a> — They persecute the true Church of Christ, but the true church shall in the end prevail and triumph over them; which particulars have been fulfilled in part already, and will be more fully accomplished hereafter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-14 The beast on which the woman sat was, and is not, and yet is. It was a seat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form, which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupid and blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within its influence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads, seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings, seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast, directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry again. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yet no kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken; but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ must reign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victory is, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme dominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare, are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The beast that thou sawest was, and is not - In the close of the verse it is added, "and yet is" - "the beast that was, and is not, and yet is." There are three things affirmed here: first, that there is a sense in which it might be said of the power here referred to, that it "was," or that, before this, it had an existence; second, that there was a sense in which it might be said that it is "not," that is, that it had become practically extinct; and third, that there is a sense in which that power would be so revived that it might be said that it "still is." The "beast" here referred to is the same that is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11-16</a>. That is, there was one great formidable power, having essentially the same origin, though manifested under somewhat different modifications, to one and all of which might, in their different manifestations, be given the same name, "the beast."<p>And shall ascend out of the bottomless pit - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  ek te&#772;s abussou. On the meaning of the word here used, see the notes on <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>. The meaning here is, that this power would seem to come up from the nether world. It would appear at one time to be extinct, but would revive again as if coming from the world over which Satan presides, and would, in its revived character, be such as might be expected from such an origin.<p>And go into perdition - That is, its end will be destruction. It will not be permanent, but will be overthrown and destroyed. The word perdition here is properly rendered by Prof. Stuart "destruction," but nothing is indicated by the word of the "nature" of the destruction that would come upon it.<p>And they that dwell on the earth - The inhabitants of the earth generally; that is, the matter referred to will be so remarkable as to attract general attention.<p>Shall wonder - It will be so contrary to the regular course of events, so difficult of explanation, so remarkable in itself, as to excite attention and surprise.<p>Whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world - See this explained in the notes on <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>. The idea seems to be, that those whose names are written in the book of life, or who are truly the friends of God, would not be drawn off in admiration of the beast, or in rendering homage to it.<p>When they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is - That is, the power that once was mighty; that had declined to such a state that it became, as it were, extinct; and that was revived again with so much of its original strength, that it might be said that it still exists. The fact of its being revived in this manner, as well as the nature of the power itself, seemed suited to excite this admiration. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. beast &#8230; was, and is not&#8212;(Compare Re 17:11). The time when the beast "is not" is the time during which it has "the deadly wound"; the time of the seventh head becoming Christian externally, when its beast-like character was put into suspension temporarily. The healing of its wound answers to its ascending out of the bottomless pit. The beast, or Antichristian world power, returns worse than ever, with satanic powers from hell (Re 11:7), not merely from the sea of convulsed nations (Re 13:1). Christian civilization gives the beast only a temporary wound, whence the deadly wound is always mentioned in connection with its being healed up the non-existence of the beast in connection with its reappearance; and Daniel does not even notice any change in the world power effected by Christianity. We are endangered on one side by the spurious Christianity of the harlot, on the other by the open Antichristianity of the beast; the third class is Christ's little flock."<p>go&#8212;So B, Vulgate, and Andreas read the future tense. But A and Iren&aelig;us, "goeth."<p>into perdition&#8212;The continuance of this revived seventh (that is, the eighth) head is short: it is therefore called "the son of perdition," who is essentially doomed to it almost immediately after his appearance.<p>names were&#8212;so Vulgate and Andreas. But A, B, Syriac, and Coptic read the singular, "name is."<p>written in&#8212;Greek, "upon."<p>which&#8212;rather, "when they behold the beast that it was," &c. So Vulgate.<p>was, and is not, and yet is&#8212;A, B, and Andreas read, "and shall come" (literally, "be present," namely, again: Greek, "kai parestai"). The Hebrew, "tetragrammaton," or sacred four letters in Jehovah, "who is, who was, and who is to come," the believer's object of worship, has its contrasted counterpart in the beast "who was, and is not, and shall be present," the object of the earth's worship [Bengel]. They exult with wonder in seeing that the beast which had seemed to have received its death blow from Christianity, is on the eve of reviving with greater power than ever on the ruins of that religion which tormented them (Re 11:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The beast that thou sawest; </span> this beast was the Roman empire, the <span class="ital">scarlet coloured beast</span> which carried the whore, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was, and is not</span>; <span class="ital">was</span> of old, in Rome’s pagan state, and <span class="ital">is not, </span> not in that form, not now pagan; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and yet is</span> (as is said in the close of the verse) the same in another form, idolatrous and persecuting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And shall ascend out of the bottomless pit; </span> either, out of the sea, which signifies a multitude of people; or, from hell; the word signifies both. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And go into perdition; </span> and shall certainly be destroyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, &c.:</span> but before he goes into perdition he shall so cheat the world, that the generality of the people shall wonder at the beast, <span class="ital">{see <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/8-8.htm" title="And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;">Revelation 8:8</a></span>}</span> setting aside those who are chosen of God to eternal salvation; the one hundred and forty-four thousand, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/14-3.htm" title="And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.">Revelation 14:3</a></span>.

It is added at the end of the verse where the same description is given, "and yet is"; this beast is to be understood not of the devil, who "was" the god of this world, "is not", being cast out by Christ, and yet is in being; for he, the dragon, is distinguished from this beast, and indeed from him the beast has his seat, power, and authority, <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> nor any particular emperor, as Domitian, a cruel and savage one, who was in power in Vespasian's time, when he was abroad, and then was out of it upon his return, and yet afterwards was in again, being as one sent from hell, and went at last into perdition; but the Roman empire itself is intended, as we have seen, which carried and supported the Papacy; and variously may this be interpreted; as that it was in the hands of the Romans originally, and long continued with them, but now "is not", in John's time, being in the hands of Trajan, a Spaniard, "and yet is" in being, Rome being the metropolis of it: it was a very powerful and flourishing empire, "and is not", being destroyed by the Goths and Vandals, "and yet is" a large empire under the jurisdiction of antichrist; it was an idolatrous empire, which encouraged the worshipping of Heathen gods, "and is not" guilty of the same idolatrous practices it was, as the worshipping of Jupiter, Mars, &amp;c. "and yet is" much given to idolatry in another way, worshipping the virgin Mary, and other saints; it "was" under kings, consuls, dictators, tribunes, decemvirs, and emperors, it "is not" in such a form of government, "and yet is" under its seventh head the pope; "Rome was", but "is not" the same it has been, in some respects, and yet is the same, for idolatry, cruelty, &amp;c. it has the image of old Rome, when Pagan, and under the power of the dragon; and though antichrist was not risen up in the empire to an head, to supreme power yet it was in being in the apostles' times, and began to work, and by degrees to show itself. In short, the meaning is, that this beast "was" the Roman empire, as Pagan, described by a dragon with seven heads, and ten horns, with crowns on the heads, but is not as yet in the Apostle John's time, as Papal, described with seven heads, and ten horns, and crowns on the horns. <p>And shall ascend out of the bottomless pit: out of hell, from whence the antichristian beast has its power; see <a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a> otherwise all civil power is from God, but not antichristian power, that is from the devil: <p>and go into perdition; everlasting destruction, the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; this will be the end of the beast, <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>. <p>and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder; the inhabitants of the Roman empire, earthly minded men, shall have the beast in great veneration, and follow and worship him; see <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a><p>whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world; none but reprobates, not any of the elect of God, are the admirers and worshippers of antichrist; See Gill on <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>. <p>when they beheld the beast that was, and is not, and yet is; the Roman empire in glory, under the emperors, destroyed by the Goths, and revived in the Papacy.

The first is a distinction of this beast from all that ever have been at any time: which distinction is contained in this verse: The second is a delineation or painting out of the beast by things present, by which he might even at that time be known by the godly: and this delineation is according to his heads in Re 17:12-14. This beast is that empire of Rome, of which I spoke in see Geneva (15) Re 13:11 according to the mutations and changes of which then had already happened, the Holy Spirit has distinguished and set out the same. The apostle distinguishes this beast from all others in these words the beast which thou saw, was and is not. For so I expound the words of the apostle for the evidence's sake, as I will further declare in the notes following.<p>(13) The meaning is, that beast which you saw before in Re 13:1 and which you have now seen, was (was I say) from Julius Caesar in respect to beginning, rising up, station, glory, dominion, manner and family, from the house of Julius: and yet is not now the same, if you look to the house and family: for the dominion of this family was translated to another, after the death of Nero from that other to a third, from a third to a fourth, and so on, was varied and altered by innumerable changes. Finally, the Empire is one, as it were one beast: but exceedingly varied by kindreds, families, and persons. It was therefore (says John) in the kindred or house of Julius: and now it is not in that kindred, but translated to another.<p>(14) As if he should say, Also this same that is, shall shortly not be: but shall ascend out of the depth, or out of the sea (as was said) in Re 13:1 that is, shall be a new stock from among the nations without difference and shall in the same state go to into destruction, or run and perish: and so shall successively new princes or emperors come and go, arise and fall, the body of the beast remaining still, but tossed with many frequent alterations, as no man can but marvel that this beast was able to stand and hold out, in so many mutations, verily no empire that ever was tossed with so many changes, and as it were with so many tempests of the sea, ever continued so long.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/revelation/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>.

Such an identification was natural in the ancient world especially, where a king and his capital or state were interchangeable terms.

True, he <span class="ital">goes to perdition</span> eventually, but not before all except the elect have succumbed to the fascination of his second advent. The Beast of the source here is evidently the antichrist figure of <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a> (also a Jewish source) transformed into Nero redivivus.

But when we find that the belief in Nero’s destined return was held by Christians for the next four centuries, if not longer, when it had quite passed out of the minds of pagans, it becomes probable that St John <span class="ital">was</span> answerable for <span class="ital">their</span> belief; at any rate, they grounded it on his words. And it is possible that he means to tell us, that the Antichrist who is to come will actually be Nero risen from the dead (we notice, that in the words of the text his death, the reality of which is historically certain, is not denied, but affirmed): more probably, Antichrist will be a new Nero in the same way as he will be a new Antiochus, an enemy of God as they were, typified by them inasmuch as they were actuated by his spirit. It is needless to suppose with M. Renan that Nero is called “the Beast” in allusion to a loathsome atrocity said to be committed by him disguised as one: the analogy of Daniel 7 is what determines the image.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall ascend out of the bottomless pit</span>] <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>, where see note.

To the problem there given there may be added a certain secondary course of the number of the beast, from the completion of his rising out of the sea, in the time of Alexander III., A. 1169, to A. 1836. (2.) That which I said above, on ch. <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>, Proposition 10, Observ. 29, may be compared.

It is not so clear respecting <span class="ital">M</span>. and <span class="ital">Pet</span>. 3 only. See App. Crit. Ed. ii. on this passage. Erasmus himself, if he were alive, would, as I think, yield the victory to so many MSS., which are now accessible, and would wonder at his followers, who so superstitiously preserve the readings formerly established by him with difficulty. When I deny, <span class="ital">that the particle</span> <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span> <span class="ital">is anywhere used by John</span>, Wolf retorts, that not even the word <span class="greekheb">παρέσται</span> is used by John.[190] But the two cases are dissimilar. For no idiomatic usage excludes the verb <span class="greekheb">παρέσται</span>. The Hebrew usage, which John greatly follows, almost everywhere renders the particle <span class="ital">although</span>, by <span class="greekheb">ו </span>or <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, according to Noldii Concord, pp. 292, 293, not by <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span>. Another argument is to be added, which plainly refutes the construction of Erasmus, <span class="greekheb">καίπερ ἐστίν</span>. For all the passages of the New Testament teach, that <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span> is not construed with a verb, but with a participle: <a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm" title="Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.">2 Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-5.htm" title="And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:">Hebrews 7:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-17.htm" title="For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.">Hebrews 12:17</a>; and especially <a href="/philippians/3-4.htm" title="Though I might also have confidence in the flesh.

The nature of the particle does not permit it: for even the simple words, of which <span class="greekheb">καίπερ</span> is compounded, namely <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> (for <span class="ital">although</span>) less frequently, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡ</span></span></span> (in Devarius), never take a verb joined with them. A more weighty argument is, that the conjecture <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊΠΕΡ</span></span></span> takes away much from the sentiment: for <span class="ital">the</span> wonder of them that dwell on the earth is excited not so much by that, that <span class="ital">the beast was and is not</span>, as by this, that the beast <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΈΣΤΑΙ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">will be present</span>. Enough of criticism: but not however to no purpose. The passage is momentous. That tetragrammaton, <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span>, LORD, has a magnificent periphrasis, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, <span class="ital">who is, and who was, and who is to come</span>. But the dwellers on the earth wonder at the beast, as though a kind of antitetragrammaton; for <span class="ital">he was, and is not, and will be present</span>.

Three stages are marked out in the existence of this world power: first, it <span class="accented">was</span>; second, it <span class="accented">is not</span> now; thirdly, it reappears, to be cast into perdition. The first period describes the condition of things before the sacrifice of Christ.

A further downfall is, therefore, prepared for it - that which will take place at the last day, when it "will ascend from the abyss to go into perdition." This nonexistence, contemporaneously with existence and subsequent reappearance, is exactly what is described in the wound healed (<a href="/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>; see also the remainder of this verse). The period, therefore, embraced in these words is that of the whole existence of this world.
