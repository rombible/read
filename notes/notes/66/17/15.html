The easily-moved passions or the fickle crowd, its generous, unreasoning impulses, are used by subtle and seductive enemies. “Men never so much need to be theocratic as when they are most democratic,” said De Tocqueville.

She herself glories in the title of the <span class="ital">catholic </span>church, and exults in the number of her votaries, as a certain proof of the true religion.

She was that great city which reigned over the kings of the earth, when John had this vision; and every one knows Rome to be that city. Believers will be received to the glory of the Lord, when wicked men will be destroyed in a most awful manner; their joining together in sin, will be turned to hatred and rage, and they will eagerly assist in tormenting each other.

The meaning here is:<p>(a) that these waters represent a multitude of people. This is a common and an obvious symbol - for outspread seas or raging floods would naturally represent such a multitude. See <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-2.htm">Jeremiah 47:2</a>. Compare Iliad, v. 394. The sense here is, that vast numbers of people would be subject to the power here represented by the woman.<p>(b) They would be composed of different nations, and would be of different languages, It is unnecessary to show that this, in both respects, is applicable to the papacy. Nations have been, and are subject to its control, and nations speaking a large part of the languages of the world. Perhaps under no one government - not even the Babylonian, the Macedonian, or the ancient Roman - was there so great a diversity of people, speaking so many different languages, and having so different an origin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Also, contrast the "many waters" Re 19:6, "Alleluia."<p>peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues&#8212;The "peoples," &c., here mark the universality of the spiritual fornication of the Church. The "tongues" remind us of the original Babel, the confusion of tongues, the beginning of Babylon, and the first commencement of idolatrous apostasy after the flood, as the tower was doubtless dedicated to the deified heavens. Thus, Babylon is the appropriate name of the harlot. The Pope, as the chief representative of the harlot, claims a double supremacy over all peoples, typified by the "two swords" according to the interpretation of Boniface VIII in the Bull, "Unam Sanctam," and represented by the two keys: spiritual as the universal bishop, whence he is crowned with the miter; and temporal, whence he is also crowned with the tiara in token of his imperial supremacy. Contrast with the Pope's diadems the "many diadems" of Him who alone has claim to, and shall exercise when He shall come, the twofold dominion (Re 19:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> John saw <span class="ital">the great whore</span> sitting upon <span class="ital">seven mountains, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/revelation/17-9.htm" title="And here is the mind which has wisdom.

So, "he drew me out of many waters", <a href="/psalms/18-16.htm">Psalm 18:16</a> is by the Targum on the place explained, he delivered me from many people.

By a continuation of his discourse (<span class="greekheb">καὶ λεγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>.), the angel interprets first of all the waters where John beheld the harlot, and announces then the judgment impending over the harlot, which, according to God’s decree, is to be executed by the ten kings in confederacy with the beast. Then, finally, the chief figure in the vision, ch 17, the harlot herself, is expressly explained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰ ὕδατα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

The <span class="greekheb">οὖτοι μισ</span>., as to its meaning, belongs to the kings to be understood among the horns (<a href="/context/revelation/17-13.htm" title="These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength to the beast....">Revelation 17:13-14</a>); these are the decisive chief subject, so that the determination of subject, besides presented in the <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ θηρίον</span>, does not come further into consideration with respect to the form of the expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἠρημωμένην ποιήσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ γυμνὴν</span>.
