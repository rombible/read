and when he shall come, he must continue a short time.</span> It has been debated whether these kings are individual sovereigns, or forms of government, or kingdoms The last view is the one adopted in this Commentary. The wild beast belongs to no one age, but is a power which has risen in every age; the seven heads represent the successive culminations of the world-power. Our space is insufficient to discuss here the whole question. But the language here used and the passages in the earlier prophets, which may be called the parent passages of the present vision, favour the interpretation that great world-kingdoms are intended. The language favours this view. It is said that the “kings fell.” The word is the one which has been used for political catastrophe: the cities of the nations fell (<a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>); Babylon, it is cried, has fallen (<a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a>). It suits the overthrow of empires, and is so used in the LXX.; to apply it to individual kings is to ask that it shall be equivalent to “they died.” It is to be noticed that the four beasts of Daniel (<a href="/context/daniel/7-3.htm" title="And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.">Daniel 7:3-8</a>) are declared to be four kings (<a href="/revelation/17-17.htm" title="For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.">Revelation 17:17</a>), but these kings are not individual kings, but represent kingdoms. (See <a href="/daniel/7-23.htm" title="Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.">Daniel 7:23</a>). This brings us to the drift of the parent passage. Daniel saw four wild beasts rise from the sea; they represented the then great world-power Babylon, and its three successors, Persia, Greece, and Rome. This is a guide to us here, as most commentators admit; but two great world-powers had preceded Babylon, viz., Egypt and Assyria: these figure in the ancient prophecies as forces hostile to the righteous King. St. John, whose visions took the range of the world’s drama, could not see the representative of the ever rising spirit of worldly hostility to God’s chosen without seeing Egypt and Assyria included. The voices of Moses and Isaiah called to him across the centuries that in these the world principle of their day found its clearest and strongest manifestation. In various empires the world-power showed itself: in Egypt, the house of bondage (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm" title="I am the LORD your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.">Exodus 20:2</a>); in Assyria, that exalted herself against God (<a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm" title="Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 37:23</a>); in Babylon, the hammer of the whole earth (<a href="/jeremiah/50-23.htm" title="How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!">Jeremiah 50:23</a>); in Persia, and in Greece; and in succession these kingdoms fell, only to be succeeded by another—Rome. Five fell; the one is. But what is the seventh, the other who is not yet come? We must recall the appearance of the wild beast. It had seven heads and ten horns. Where were these ten horns? It seems generally admitted that they were all on the seventh head. The seventh head, which represents the seventh kingdom, or manifestation of the world principle which is described as not yet come, then, was different in appearance from the others. It was ten-horned. It had not the same unity of appearance as the others. Now the ten horns are explained as ten kings or minor powers (<a href="/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a>). The conclusion, therefore, is that the seventh head must be rather an aggregation of monarchies than a single universal empire. This agrees with Daniel’s prophecy that out of the fourth kingdom, which corresponds, as we have seen, with the sixth head of the wild beast here, ten kings should arise (<a href="/daniel/7-7.htm" title="After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.">Daniel 7:7</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/7-23.htm" title="Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.">Daniel 7:23-24</a>).<p>The seventh kingdom (the ten-horned head) it is said will, when it arises, continue a “short time.” The short time is probably the same as the “one hour” in <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a>, where the ten kingdoms, represented by the ten horns, receive power one hour with the wild beast.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-14 The beast on which the woman sat was, and is not, and yet is. It was a seat of idolatry and persecution, and is not; not in the ancient form, which was pagan: yet it is; it is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and form. It would deceive into stupid and blind submission all the inhabitants of the earth within its influence, except the remnant of the elect. This beast was seven heads, seven mountains, the seven hills on which Rome stands; and seven kings, seven sorts of government. Five were gone by when this prophecy was written; one was then in being; the other was yet to come. This beast, directed by the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry again. It had ten horns, which are said to be ten kings who had as yet no kingdoms; they should not rise up till the Roman empire was broken; but should for a time be very zealous in her interest. Christ must reign till all enemies be put under his feet. The reason of the victory is, that he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has supreme dominion and power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to his control. His followers are called to this warfare, are fitted for it, and will be faithful in it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there are seven kings - That is, seven in all, as they are enumerated in this verse and the next. An eighth is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-11.htm">Revelation 17:11</a>, but it is, at the same time, said that this one so pertains to the seven, or is so properly in one sense of the number seven, though, in another sense, to be regarded as an eighth, that it may be properly reckoned as the seventh. The word "kings" - &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  basileis - may be understood, so far as the meaning of the word is concerned:<p>(a) literally, as denoting a king, or one who exercises royal authority;<p>(b) in a more general sense, as denoting one of distinguished honor - a viceroy, prince, leader, chief, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>,<a href="/matthew/2-9.htm">Matthew 2:9</a>; <a href="/luke/1-5.htm">Luke 1:5</a>; <a href="/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1</a>;<p>(c) in a still larger sense, as denoting a dynasty, a form of government, a mode of administration, as what, in fact, "rules."<p>See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, where the word "king" undoubtedly denotes a "dynasty," or "form of rule." The notion of ruling, or of authority, is undoubtedly in the word, for the verb &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  basileuo&#772; means "to rule," but the word may be applied to anything in which sovereignty resides. Thus it is applied to a king's son, to a military commander, to the gods, to a Greek archon, etc. See Passow. It would be contrary to the whole spirit of this passage, and to what is demanded by the proper meaning of the word, to insist that the word should denote literally kings, and that it could not be applied to emperors, or to dictators, or to dynasties.<p>Five are fallen - Have passed away as if fallen; that is, they have disappeared. The language would be applicable to rulers who have died, or who had been dethroned; or to dynasties or forms of government that had ceased to be. In the fulfillment of this, it would be necessary to find five such successive kings or rulers who had died, and who pertained to one sovereignty or nation; or five such dynasties or forms of administrations that had successively existed, but which had ceased.<p>And one is - That is, there is one - a sixth - that now reigns. The proper interpretation of this would be, that this existed in the time of the writer; that is, according to the view taken of the time of the writing of the Apocalypse (see Intro., section 2), at the close of the first century.<p>And the other is not yet come - The sixth one is to be succeeded by another in the same line, or occupying the same dominion.<p>And when he cometh - When that form of dominion is set up. No intimation is yet given as to the time when this would occur.<p>He must continue a short space - &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  oligon. A short time; his dominion will be of short duration. It is observable that this characteristic is stated as applicable only to this one of the seven; and the fair meaning would seem to be, that the time would be short as compared with the six that preceded, and as compared with the one that followed - the eighth - into which it was to be merged, <a href="/revelation/17-11.htm">Revelation 17:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. there are&#8212;Translate, "they (the seven heads) are seven kings."<p>five &#8230; one&#8212;Greek, "the five &#8230; the one"; the first five of the seven are fallen (a word applicable not to forms of government passing away, but to the fall of once powerful empires: Egypt, Eze 29:1-30:26; Assyria and Nineveh, Na 3:1-19; Babylon, Re 18:2; Jer 50:1-51:64; Medo-Persia, Da 8:3-7, 20-22; 10:13; 11:2; Greece, Da 11:4). Rome was "the one" existing in John's days. "Kings" is the Scripture phrase for kingdoms, because these kingdoms are generally represented in character by some one prominent head, as Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, Medo-Persia by Cyrus, Greece by Alexander, &c.<p>the other is not yet come&#8212;not as Alford, inaccurately representing Auberlen, the Christian empire beginning with Constantine; but, the Germanic-Slavonic empire beginning and continuing in its beast-like, that is, HEATHEN Antichristian character for only "a short space." The time when it is said of it, "it is not" (Re 17:11), is the time during which it is "wounded to death," and has the "deadly wound" (Re 13:3). The external Christianization of the migrating hordes from the North which descended on Rome, is the wound to the beast answering to the earth swallowing up the flood (heathen tribes) sent by the dragon, Satan, to drown the woman, the Church. The emphasis palpably is on "a short space," which therefore comes first in the Greek, not on "he must continue," as if his continuance for some [considerable] time were implied, as Alford wrongly thinks. The time of external Christianization (while the beast's wound continues) has lasted for centuries, ever since Constantine. Rome and the Greek Church have partially healed the wound by image worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And there are seven kings; </span> the <span class="ital">seven heads</span> do not only signify seven hills or mountains, but also <span class="ital">seven kings, </span> that is, (according to the best interpretation I meet with), seven forms of government which ruled Rome; the term <span class="ital">kings, </span> it Scripture, signifying rulers, whether the government was in single persons, or more, as <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm" title="And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.">Deu 33:5</a></span>.

This to me seemeth the most probable interpretation of this difficult text. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there are seven kings,.... The Arabic version renders it, "who are seven kings"; and it should be rendered, as it is by the Vulgate Latin, Syriac and Ethiopic versions, "and they are seven kings"; that is, the seven heads signify seven kings also, for they have in them a double representation, first of seven mountains, and then of seven kings; by which are meant not seven ages of the world, as from Adam to Noah; from Noah to Abraham; from Abraham to David; from David to the Babylonish captivity; from the Babylonish captivity to Christ; from Christ to antichrist; and from antichrist to the end of the world; the five first of which were gone in John's time, the sixth was then in being, and when the seventh shall come it will continue for a short time: this is a foolish and absurd interpretation of the Papists, who make the beast to be the devil, and these his seven heads; whereas he rather is the head, or god of the world: nor are seven emperors of Rome intended, which are differently reckoned, according to the different times John is supposed to have had this revelation. Grotius, who is followed by Hammond, supposes this was written in the times of Vespasian, and reckons them thus; Clandius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, and Titus; the first five of these were dead in John's time, one was then, the sixth, Vespasian, the then reigning emperor, and the other, Titus, was yet to come to the empire; and when he came to it, continued but a short time, two years and two mouths: others, who more rightly judge that John wrote in Domitian's time, reckon them after this manner; Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, and Nerva; the first five of these were dead; Domitian was then living, and Nerva, the other that was to come and succeed him, reigned but a little while, not quite two years; but to this sense must be objected, that there were other emperors before either Galba or Claudius; and before John's time there were more than five fallen or dead; according to the first account, there must be nine dead, and according to the latter eleven; for before Claudius there were Julius, Augustus, Tiberius, and Caius: besides, if these were the seven heads of the beast, the beast must have been long ago without any head, and consequently must have expired; whereas it is still in being, and will be under the fifth, sixth, and seventh vials, which are yet to come; it will be at the battle of Armageddon, and will be taken then, and cast alive into the lake of fire; to which may be added, that the beast, in the form in which John now saw it, was not yet risen in the times of these emperors; but by the seven heads are meant so many forms of government which took place successively in the Roman empire, and were all of them idolatrous heads, as kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, tribunes, emperors, and popes; it being usual for any sort of governors, or governments and monarchies, to be called kings, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>. <p>Five are fallen; or ceased, are no longer in being as kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, and tribunes; at least, the supreme power was not lodged in any bearing either of these names in John's time: <p>and one is; the Pagan emperors; an Heathen emperor, Domitian, then reigning, when John had this vision; and these continued to the opening of the sixth seal, which put an end to that succession, as Pagan, and till the woman brought forth the man child, or till Constantine's time: <p>and the other is not yet come; which some understand of the Christian emperors, who immediately succeeded the Pagan ones, and were another, and different from them, as to religion, though the form of government was the same, and were not another head; for they were not an idolatrous head, on which were names of blasphemy, but another king; for from the following verse it appears, that there are eight kings, and but seven heads, and therefore one of them should seem not to be a head; and these, when they came, continued but a short time in comparison of the Heathen emperors that reigned before them, and of the hope, or antichrist, who was to reign after them 1260 years; for they reigned not, put them all together, more than 150 years; and especially at Rome their stay was short, for Constantine removed from thence to Constantinople, in the nineteenth year of his empire. But these emperors, though in religion they differed from the others, yet their form of government and title were the same, and therefore must be included in the sixth head: according to some, Theodoricus the Ostrogoth, and his successors, are meant, who continued about an hundred years; others have thought that the exarchs of Ravenna, who rose up upon the destruction of the western empire, are intended, and who continued but a short time; but then these had not their seat at Rome, which it seems necessary each head of this beast should have; it is better, therefore, to understand this of the popes of Rome, the seventh and last head of the Roman empire; these were not yet come, in John's time, to their supreme dignity and authority: <p>and when he cometh he must continue a short space; forty two months, or 1260 days; that is, so many years, which, though a long time in itself, and in the account of man, yet with God, with whom a thousand years is as one day, and in comparison of the everlasting kingdom of Christ, and his people, it is but a short space; and so the reign of the beast, and of the ten kings with him, is said to be one hour, <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a> and this is said for the comfort of the saints, and to keep up their faith and patience under their sufferings in antichristian states. Mr. Daubuz makes these seven heads, or kings, signified by seven mountains, seven capital cities, which by degrees came to belong to the Roman empire; as first Rome itself, the capital of Italy; next Carthage, the capital of Africa; then Aege, the capital of Macedonia; after that Antiochia, the capital of the east; then Augustodunum, the capital of the Gauls; and Alexandria, the capital of Egypt; five of these six, with the monarchies belonging to them, were fallen; one, or the first of them now, was the mistress of all; and the other seventh was to come, namely, Byzantium, or Contantinople, which continued not long. This passage is so interpreted, as also the seven heads, in <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> by this writer. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{18}</span> And there are seven kings: <span class="cverse3">{19}</span> five are fallen, <span class="cverse3">{20}</span> and one is, <span class="cverse3">{21}</span> <i>and</i> the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</span><p>(18) The beginning of these kings or emperors is almost the same as the beginning of the Church of Christ, which I showed before in see Geneva (2) Re 11:1. Namely from the 25th year after the passion of Christ, at which time the temple and church of the Jews was overthrown. In this year it came to pass by the providence of God, that that saying The beast was, and is not was fulfilled before the destruction of the Jews immediately following, came to pass. That was 809 years from the building of the city of Rome at which time John counted the emperors who had been, when he wrote these things, and foretells two others next to come: and with this purpose, that when this particular prediction of things to come should take effect, the truth of all other predictions in the Church, might be the more confirmed. God in ancient times mentioned this sign in the Law and Jeremiah confirmed it in De 18:1-22, Jer 28:8.<p>(19) Whose names are these: the first, Servius Sulpitius Galba, who was the seventh emperor of the people of Rome, the second Marcus Salvius Otho, the third Avlus Vitellius, the fourth, Titus Flavius Vespasianus, the fifth, Titus Vespasianus his son, of his own name.<p>(20) Flavius Domitian, son of the first Vespasian. For in the latter end of his days John wrote these things, as witnesses Irenaus; Lib. 5 adversus hareses.<p>(21) Nerua, The empire being now translated from the family of Flavius.

On this view, the ten horns are all on one head: it is this ten-horned head which receives the deadly wound of <a href="/revelation/13-3.htm" title="And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.">Revelation 13:3</a> : i.e. the Beast is nearly slain (the Empire <span class="ital">as an evil and persecuting power</span> overthrown) by the conversion, first of the later emperors, and then of the sovereigns of Europe, to Christianity: but he revives—e.g. in Julian after Constantine, and again in the neo-paganism of the Renaissance and the persecutions of the Reformation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With all the elements of truth that must be acknowledged in this view, it seems hardly possible to doubt that the Beast, so closely united with the City of the Seven Hills, represents the <span class="ital">Roman</span> Empire particularly. On this view, the “kings” have been taken to represent <span class="ital">forms of government</span>—Rome having been successively governed, it is said, by kings, consuls, dictators, decemvirs, military tribunes, emperors, and Christian emperors (the last being taken, as before, to be the <span class="ital">wounded</span> head: some however make the conversion of Constantine a wound to the <span class="ital">sixth</span> head, and count the Ostrogoth kings as the seventh). But considering that the dictatorship, the decemvirate, and even the tribunate, were transitory episodes in the Roman government—the first avowedly exceptional, the second both exceptional and ephemeral, and all three, as well as the primitive monarchy, probably unknown to St John’s original readers,—this view does not appear even plausible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It remains then that the kings be taken as individual Emperors of Rome: (it must be remembered that though these were never called “kings” in Latin, the Greek equivalent title was constantly applied to the Emperors: see e.g. <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1 Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1 Peter 2:17</a>.) Who then were the first seven Emperors? According to the common reckoning, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Gaius (often called by modern writers by his nickname <span class="ital">Caligula</span>, “Little Boots”), Claudius, Nero, and Galba. But Julius Caesar, though he received the title of <span class="ital">Imperator</span> as the later Emperors did, cannot be considered, and is not considered by careful historians, as the first of the “Emperors,” if the Empire be spoken of as a settled form of government. His authority in the state, so far as it was constitutional at all, lay in his Dictatorship: which office was legally abolished immediately after his death, and never revived. Augustus, and the later Emperors, ruled not as Dictator, but as Chief of the Senate with the power of Tribune.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">five are fallen</span>] Augustus, Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius, and Nero. (It is argued that the word “fallen” is not “appropriate to Augustus and Tiberius, who died in their beds:” but see <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a>, mar.) Is then the “one who is” Galba? So he is generally understood by those who adopt this scheme of interpretation: and if so, the date of the vision (see Introduction) is fixed at a time between June a.d. 68, and the 15th of January 69, when Galba was murdered. He was succeeded by Otho, who certainly “continued a short space,” if he could be said to continue at all: he killed himself, on April 15th, when defeated by the army of Vitellius, who had revolted from Galba a few days before his murder by Otho.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the rest of the prophecy, on this view, received nothing that can be reckoned as even a typical fulfilment. Vitellius, despite many contemptible vices, was a good-natured man, and not a bad ruler, so far as he had energy to rule at all. He could not be considered as an incarnation of the Antichristian power, nor even as a revival of Nero, though he, as well as Otho, treated Nero’s memory with respect. And considering that Galba had only reigned in Rome for a few weeks before his death (though he had been acknowledged longer), that Otho <span class="ital">never</span> had an uncontested title, and Vitellius only from about the end of April to July 1st, it seems likelier that these three are passed over, as claimants of empire (and they had not been the only ones: see on <span class="ital"><a href="/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a></span>) rather than actual emperors. Thus, the sixth king will be Vespasian, who was proclaimed emperor on July 1st, a.d. 69: his troops gained a decisive victory over those of Vitellius late in October, and Rome was taken, and Vitellius killed, on Dec. 21st.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Vespasian reigned well and peaceably, and was succeeded by his elder son Titus, in June 79: who “continued a short space,” till Sept. 13th, a.d. 81, when he died, aged 40;—murdered, as some said, by his brother Domitian, who succeeded him, and who was regarded, by pagans and Christians alike, as a revival of Nero (Juv. iv. 38; Tert. <span class="ital">Apol.</span> c. 7). Like Nero, he persecuted the Christians: like Nero, he indulged in the most hideous vices: though unlike Nero, he had a strong sense of decorum, and was fanatically attached to the Roman religion. Further than this, the vision does not follow the fortunes of the Empire in detail. At the point where the type of Antichrist comes into the history, the prophecy introduces Antichrist himself: cf. Daniel 11, as understood by most orthodox interpreters.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">must continue a short space</span>] Both “continue” and “short” seem to be emphatic—his reign is to be short, but not ephemeral. Thus the designation seems more appropriate to Titus than to Otho. St Victorinus (in the present text) applies it to <span class="ital">Nerva</span>, who like Titus reigned mildly for only two years. But his successor Trajan (though he to a certain extent sanctioned the persecution of Christianity, and is said himself to have condemned St Ignatius) was anything but an Antichrist. It seems as though St Victorinus (or his editor) were making a rather clumsy attempt to reconcile the interpretation here given, which he was acquainted with as a tradition, with the general belief that St John was writing under Domitian.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/17.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ πέντε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ εἷς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄλλος</span>) The Article has a force relative to those <span class="ital">seven</span>, who are distributed into <span class="ital">five</span>, and <span class="ital">one</span>, and <span class="ital">the other</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὀλίγον</span>, <span class="ital">a short space</span>) This extends as far as the <span class="ital">hour</span>, in which not the other by himself, but the ten kings reign <span class="ital">with the beast</span>, <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a>.

But if mathematicians, musicians, painters, and all artists, bestow pains upon the smallest subjects, and seek elegance in the smallest matters IN PARTICULAR, why should we not comply with prophecy showing itself most admirable in the smallest calculations?

The phrase in ver. 9, "seven mountains," regarded the world power as one universal indivisible whole, without respect to particular times or modes in which it might be exhibited. In this phrase, "seven kings," we have the same world power viewed in its successive exhibitions by different nations; though here again we must be on our guard not to interpret the number <span class="accented">seven</span> literally of seven nations. The <span class="accented">kings</span> represent Worldly states or kingdoms; <span class="accented">seven</span>, again, betokens universality. We are thus told that this world power on which the woman relies is exhibited in the manifestation of power by successive nations, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Egyptian, Assyrian, Roman, etc., as many as have ever existed or shall exist; for this is the meaning of <span class="accented">seven. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come;</span> <span class="accented">the five</span>; <span class="accented">the one</span>; <span class="accented">the other.</span> Omit "and." Here, again, not literally <span class="accented">five.</span> The seer divides the whole series of antitheistic world powers into three groups, and he would say, some, probably the majority, of these are passed away; the second group embraces the world power as it is exhibited now, whether Roman, Jewish, or any other; in the third group are included those yet to come. Thus those writers who enumerate Egypt, Nineveh, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Syria, etc., in the first group, are partially correct, and only wrong in so far as they attempt to limit and define the kingdoms; and similarly also those who in the third group place the Roman empire after the barbarian invasions, or imperial Germany, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And when he cometh, he must continue a short space;</span> a <span class="accented">little while</span> (Revised Version).
