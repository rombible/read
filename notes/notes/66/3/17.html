Christ was about to reject them for being in that tepid state which, beginning with self-satisfaction, led on to self- deception. They were rich in worldly goods (unlike the Church in Smyrna), but their very wealth led them into a quiet unaggressively kind of religion; they were proud also of their intellectual wealth; self- complacent because in comfortable worldly circumstances, and became puffed up with a vain philosophy, they learned to be satisfied with their spiritual state, and to believe the best of themselves, and then to believe in themselves. Hypocrites they were, who did not know they were hypocrites. They thought themselves good; and this self-deception was their danger. “For,” to use Prof. Mozley’s words, “why should a man repent of his goodness? He may well repent, indeed, of his falsehood; but unhappily the falsehood of it is just the thing he does not see, and which he cannot see by the very law of his character.

Here our Lord Jesus styles himself, The Amen; one steady and unchangeable in all his purposes and promises. If religion is worth anything, it is worth every thing. Christ expects men should be in earnest. How many professors of gospel doctrine are neither hot nor cold; except as they are indifferent in needful matters, and hot and fiery in disputes about things of lesser moment! A severe punishment is threatened. They would give a false opinion of Christianity, as if it were an unholy religion; while others would conclude it could afford no real satisfaction, otherwise its professors would not have been heartless in it, or so ready to seek pleasure or happiness from the world. One cause of this indifference and inconsistency in religion is, self-conceit and self-delusion; Because thou sayest. What a difference between their thoughts of themselves, and the thoughts Christ had of them! How careful should we be not to cheat our owns souls! There are many in hell, who once thought themselves far in the way to heaven. Let us beg of God that we may not be left to flatter and deceive ourselves. Professors grow proud, as they become carnal and formal. Their state was wretched in itself. They were poor; really poor, when they said and thought they were rich. They could not see their state, nor their way, nor their danger, yet they thought they saw it. They had not the garment of justification, nor sanctification: they were exposed to sin and shame; their rags that would defile them. They were naked, without house or harbour, for they were without God, in whom alone the soul of man can find rest and safety. Good counsel was given by Christ to this sinful people. Happy those who take his counsel, for all others must perish in their sins. Christ lets them know where they might have true riches, and how they might have them. Some things must be parted with, but nothing valuable; and it is only to make room for receiving true riches. Part with sin and self-confidence, that you may be filled with his hidden treasure. They must receive from Christ the white raiment he purchased and provided for them; his own imputed righteousness for justification, and the garments of holiness and sanctification. Let them give themselves up to his word and Spirit, and their eyes shall be opened to see their way and their end. Let us examine ourselves by the rule of his word, and pray earnestly for the teaching of his Holy Spirit, to take away our pride, prejudices, and worldly lusts. Sinners ought to take the rebukes of God's word and rod, as tokens of his love to their souls. Christ stood without; knocking, by the dealings of his providence, the warnings and teaching of his word, and the influences of his Spirit. Christ still graciously, by his word and Spirit, comes to the door of the hearts of sinners. Those who open to him shall enjoy his presence. If what he finds would make but a poor feast, what he brings will supply a rich one. He will give fresh supplies of graces and comforts. In the conclusion is a promise to the overcoming believer. Christ himself had temptations and conflicts; he overcame them all, and was more than a conqueror. Those made like to Christ in his trials, shall be made like to him in glory. All is closed with the general demand of attention. And these counsels, while suited to the churches to which they were addressed, are deeply interesting to all men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because thou sayest, I am rich - So far as the language here is concerned, this may refer either to riches literally, or to spiritual riches; that is, to a boast of having religion enough. Prof. Stuart supposes that it refers to the former, and so do Wetstein, Vitringa, and others. Doddridge, Rosenmuller, and others, understand it in the latter sense. There is no doubt that there was much wealth in Laodicea, and that, as a people, they prided themselves on their riches. See the authorities in Wetstein on <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>, and Vitringa, p. 160. It is not easy to determine which is the true sense; but may it not have been that there was an allusion to both, and that, in every respect, they boasted that they had enough? May it not have been so much the characteristic of that people to boast of their wealth, that they carried the spirit into everything, and manifested it even in regard to religion? Is it not true that they who have much of this world's goods, when they make a profession of religion, are very apt to suppose that they are well off in everything, and to feel self-complacent and happy? And is not the possession of much wealth by an individual Christian, or a Christian church, likely to produce just the lukewarmness which it is said existed in the church at Laodicea? If we thus understand it, there will be an accordance with the well-known fact that Laodicea was distinguished for its riches, and, at the same time, with another fact, so common as to be almost universal, that the possession of great wealth tends to make a professed Christian self-complacent and satisfied in every respect; to make him feel that, although he may not have much religion, yet he is on the whole well off; and to produce, in religion, a state of just such lukewarmness as the Saviour here says was loathsome and odious.<p>And increased with goods - &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;  peploute&#772;ka - "am enriched." This is only a more emphatic and intensive way of saying the same thing. It has no reference to the kind of riches referred to, but merely denotes the confident manner in which they affirmed that they were rich.<p>And have need of nothing - Still an emphatic and intensive way of saying that they were rich. In all respects their needs were satisfied; they had enough of everything. They felt, therefore, no stimulus to effort; they sat down in contentment, self-complacency, and indifference. It is almost unavoidable that those who are rich in this world's goods should feel that they have need of nothing. There is no more common illusion among people than the feeling that if one has wealth he has everything; that there is no want of his nature which cannot be satisfied with that; and that he may now sit down in contentment and ease. Hence, the almost universal desire to be rich; hence the common feeling among those who are rich that there is no occasion for solicitude or care for anything else. Compare <a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>.<p>And knowest not - There is no just impression in regard to the real poverty and wretchedness of your condition.<p>That thou art wretched - The word "wretched" we now use to denote the actual consciousness of being miserable, as applicable to one who is sunk into deep distress or affliction. The word here, however, refers rather, to the condition itself than to the consciousness of that condition, for it is said that they did not know it. Their state was, in fact, a miserable state, and was suited to produce actual distress if they had had any just sense of it, though they thought that it was otherwise.<p>And miserable - This word has, with us now, a similar signification; but the term used here - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  ele&#772;inos - rather means a pitiable state than one actually felt to be so. The meaning is, that their condition was one that was suited to excite pity or compassion; not that they were actually miserable. Compare the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-19.htm">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>.<p>And poor - Notwithstanding all their boast of having enough. They really had not what was necessary to meet the actual needs of their nature, and, therefore, they were poor. Their worldly property could not meet the needs of their souls; and, with all their pretensions to piety, they had not religion enough to meet the necessities of their nature when calamities should come, or when death should approach; and they were, therefore, in the strictest sense of the term, poor.<p>And blind - That is, in a spiritual respect. They did not see the reality of their condition; they had no just views of themselves, of the character of God, of the way of salvation. This seems to be said in connection with the boast which they made in their own minds - that they had everything; that they wanted nothing. One of the great blessings of life is clearness of vision, and their boast that they had everything must have included that; but the speaker here says that they lacked that indispensable thing to completeness of character and to full enjoyment. With all their boasting, they were actually blind - and how could one who was in that state say that he "had need of nothing?"<p>And naked - Of course, spiritually. Salvation is often represented as a garment <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11-12</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/7-13.htm">Revelation 7:13-14</a>; and the declaration here is equivalent to saying that they had no religion. They had nothing to cover the nakedness of the soul, and in respect to the real needs of their nature they were like one who had no clothing in reference to cold, and heat, and storms, and to the shame of nakedness. How could such an one be regarded as rich? We may learn from this instructive verse:<p>(1) That people may think themselves to be rich, and yet, in fact, be miserably poor. They may have the wealth of this world in abundance, and yet have nothing that really will meet their needs in disappointment, bereavement, sickness, death; the needs of their never-dying soul; their needs in eternity. What had the "rich fool," as he is commonly termed, in the parable, when he came to die? <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16</a> ff. What had "Dives," as he is commonly termed, to meet the needs of his nature when he went down to hell? <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a> ff.<p>(2) people may have much property, and think that they have all they want, and yet be wretched. In the sense that their condition is a wretched condition, this is always true; and in the sense that they are consciously wretched, this may be, and often is, true also.<p>(3) people may have great property, and yet be miserable. This is true in the sense that their condition is a pitiable one, and in the sense that they are actually unhappy. There is no more pitiable condition than that where one has great property, and is self-complacent and proud, and who has nevertheless no God, no Saviour, no hope of heaven, and who perhaps that very day may "lift up his eyes in hell, being in torments"; and it need not be added that there is no greater actual misery in this world than what sometimes finds its way into the palaces of the rich. He greatly errs who thinks that misery is confined to the cottages of the poor.<p>(4) people may be rich, and think they have all that they want, and yet be blind to their condition. They really have no distinct vision of anything. They have no just views of God, of themselves, of their duty, of this world, or of the next. In most important respects they are in a worse condition than the inmates of an asylum for the blind, for they may have clear views of God and of heaven. Mental darkness is a greater calamity than the loss of natural vision; and there is many an one who is surrounded by all that affluence can give, who never yet had one correct view of his own character, of his God, or of the reality of his condition, and whose condition might have been far better if he had actually been born blind.<p>(5) there may be gorgeous robes of adorning, and yet real nakedness. With all the decorations that wealth can impart, there may be a nakedness of the soul as real as that of the body would be if, without a rag to cover it, it were exposed to cold, and storm, and shame. The soul destitute of the robes of salvation, is in a worse condition than the body without raiment; for how can it bear the storms of wrath that shall beat upon it forever, and the shame of its exposure in the last dread day? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

In worldly goods, which occasioned her lukewarmness, as riches often do, and her vanity, pride, and arrogance, afterwards expressed. Laodicea was a very rich city, and so will be this church state, through the accession of kings and princes, and great men of the earth unto it, in the former period: riches seldom do any good to the churches of Christ, they did not in Constantine's time; and it seems that even at the close of the spiritual reign of Christ they will be of bad consequence, since they will usher in the Laodicean church state: or her meaning is, that she was rich in spiritual things; not in grace, but in external gifts, which still remained, upon the very great pouring forth of the Spirit in the last church state; and in good works, on which she too much trusted for salvation, placing her righteousness in them: she is one whom the Jews (c) call , "rich in the law": <p>and increased with goods: with outward peace and prosperity, with much natural and divine light and knowledge, with the purity of Gospel ordinances, even beyond the former church state in her own imagination: <p>and have need of nothing: contenting herself with these external things: true believers, as considered in Christ, stand in need of nothing indeed, they are complete in him, and have everything in him; but, as considered in themselves, they are daily in need of daily food for their souls, as for their bodies, of fresh light and life, strength and comfort, and of new supplies of grace; wherefore this church shows great ignorance of herself, as well as great pride and arrogance to express herself in this manner: <p>and knowest not that thou art wretched; as all men are in a state of nature and unregeneracy; which may be the case of many professors, and they be ignorant of it; as to be under a sentence of wrath, obnoxious to the curses of the law, in danger of hell and destruction, lost and undone, and unable to extricate themselves out of such a state: true believers account themselves wretched, as the Apostle Paul did, on account of indwelling sin, and the plague of their own hearts, which the members of this church, the greater part of them, were ignorant of: <p>and miserable; a miserable man is one that is attended with outward afflictions, but this was not the case of this church; and with spiritual poverty, blindness, and nakedness, and this was her case; some persons neither know their misery, nor their need of mercy: <p>and poor; not in purse, nor in spirit, nor with respect to outward afflictions, nor as to her church state, but in a spiritual sense; one whom the Jews call a (d) , "poor in the law"; as such may be said to be who have nothing to eat that is fit to eat; nothing to wear but rags, and have no money to buy either; who are in debt, and not able to pay, nor to help themselves on any account; and this may be the case of professors, and yet not known and considered by them: <p>and blind; natural men are blind as to a saving knowledge of God in Christ, as to the way of salvation by Christ, as to the plague of their own hearts, as to the work of the Spirit of God upon the soul, and as to the truths of the Gospel, in the power of them; but here it regards blindness with respect to her church state, and its imperfection: <p>and naked; sin has stripped man of his moral clothing; man's own righteousness will not cover his nakedness; and whoever is destitute of the righteousness of Christ is a naked person, <p>(c) Yalkut Simeoni, par. 2. fol. 106. 2.((d) Vajikra Rabba, sect. 34. fol. 173. 4. vid.

But this would not be the case, had the church fallen into the grossest mammon-worship, and entirely forgotten any higher need beyond that of their earthly riches. A church, on the contrary, which trusts in its spiritual riches, and still has the consciousness of having obtained these riches, will not be entirely without them,[1587] but is, of course, implicated in an arrogant self-deception concerning its spiritual wealth. The church is in reality not rich;[1588] for, if it were, it would not say so, as in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a>.

The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣῪ</span></span></span> has an emphatic position: just thou, thou who regardest thyself so rich.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΤΑΛΑΊΠΩΡΟς</span></span></span>. This adjective occurs in the N. T., besides here, only in <a href="/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24</a>.

First of all, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑΛΑΙΠ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΛΕΕΙΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> stand in sharp opposition to the final words of boasting, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΔ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΧΡΕΊΑΝ ἜΧΩ</span></span></span>; then the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΠΤΩΧΌς</span></span></span> to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΟΥΣ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸΜῚ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΕΠΛΟΎΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>; while the ideas of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΥΦΛΌς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΥΜΝΌς</span></span></span> are combined with that of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΤΩΧΌς</span></span></span>, since spiritual poverty essentially identical with spiritual misery may be considered spiritual blindness and nakedness. Thus what the Lord judges concerning the true character of the church appears most definitely expressed in the three items <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΤΩΧΌς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤΥΦΛΌς</span></span></span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΥΜΝΌς</span></span></span>; hence the advice which now follows (<a href="/revelation/3-18.htm" title="I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.">Revelation 3:18</a>) revolves about the same, as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΥΣΊΟΝ</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΠΛΟΥΤΉΣῌς</span></span></span> applies to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΤΩΧΌς</span></span></span>, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἹΜΆΤΙΑ</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΓΥΜΝΌΤΗΤΟς ΣΟΥ</span></span></span> to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΥΜΝΌς</span></span></span>, and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΛΛΟΎΡΙΟΝ</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἽΝΑ ΒΛΈΠῌς</span></span></span> to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΥΦΛΌς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΣΥΜΒΟΥΛΕΎΩ</span></span></span>. Not without a certain irony,[1594] provoked by the arrogant imagination of the one so miserable and poor. Beng. finds in the expression an indication of estrangement, since it is only to strangers that advice, while to those who are one’s own, a command, is given;—inapplicable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΟΡΆΣΑΙ</span></span></span>. The Roman-Catholic idea of a <span class="ital">meritum de congruo</span> can be derived from the <span class="greekheb">ἀγράσαι</span> only when by pressing the expression, and in opposition to the context (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΤΩΧΌς</span></span></span>), an equivalent purchase price is in some way stated; and this is defined as “good works,”[1595] or as “prayer, tears, repentance, good works.”[1596] But if the spiritual good to be obtained from the Lord be once regarded as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΥΣΊΟΝ</span></span></span>, the result is,—especially according to the type of <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>,—that the corresponding concrete idea of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΟΡΆΣΑΙ</span></span></span> is as readily designated as the purity of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΥΣΊΟΝ</span></span></span> by the metaphorical statement <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΠΥΡΩΜΈΝΟΝ ἘΚ ΠΥΡΌς</span></span></span>; and it is just as incorrect in the latter expression to think of a confirmation of faith in trouble,[1597] etc.,[1598] as to treat the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΟΡΆΣΑΙ</span></span></span> in an unevangelical sense. In accord with the sense, Beng. explains: “It costs no more than the surrender of the idea of one’s own wealth.”[1599]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡʼ ἘΜΟῦ</span></span></span>: As the only Saviour.

Spiritual good as that which actually makes rich (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ΠΛΟΥΤῆΣῇς</span></span></span>), in contradistinction to the poverty of the church. To interpret the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΥΣΊΟΝ</span></span></span> as “love,”[1600] or as “faith,”[1601] is too special.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΠΥΡΩΜΈΝΟΝ ἘΚ ΠΥΡΌς</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΥΡΎΩ</span></span></span> = <span class="greekheb">צָרַף</span>, <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm" title="And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.">Zechariah 13:9</a>. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ</span></span></span> represents the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠῦΡ</span></span></span> as the cause whence the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΥΡΟῦΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> proceeds;[1602] according to the sense, it is therefore correctly rendered “purified by fire.”[1603] The entire expression designates not “wisdom inflamed with love,”[1604] or “tested faith;”[1605] as, on the contrary, the exposition must be made, that it is only through faith that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΥΣ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΕΠΥΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΚ ΠΥΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is won: but as the purified gold is completely pure and truly precious, so is the spiritual good to be obtained of the Lord unconditionally holy and true, and eternally enriching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἹΜΑΤΊΑ ΛΕΥΚΆ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> Cf. <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm" title="You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.">Revelation 3:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know.

Only in the figurative mode of presentation, and not in the proper sense, are the “white garments” to be distinguished from the “gold,” just as nakedness is in reality nothing but poverty. The remark of Ebrard is arbitrary, that “the command is to be executed in the reverse order from that in which it is given. The ultimate end, to become rich, viz., in good fruits that have some value before God, is first named; for this, gold must be bought. But before gold can be considered, garments must first be purchased in order to cover the nakedness; and as the covering of the nakedness cannot be accomplished before the eyes are open, eyesalve must first of all be applied.” But the “gold” is mentioned first only because, with respect to fancied riches and actual poverty (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a>), this is the nearest thought; but the succession of the particular items neither in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a> nor <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm" title="I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.">Revelation 3:18</a> is to be urged, since the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΥΦΛΌς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΥΜΝΌς</span></span></span> are connected with the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΤΩΧΌς</span></span></span>, in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a>, in a different order from the corresponding members in <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm" title="I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.">Revelation 3:18</a>.

In classical writers, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΛΛΎΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span>. The word designates a substance brought to the long round form of a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΛΛΎΡΑ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">roll</span> (e.g., breadcake), which being mixed with various drugs was used for anointing the eyes.[1606] The Jewish designation <span class="ital">(</span>קילורית) קולורין agrees with the form <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΛΛΟΎΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span>. Here is meant, not the word of God itself,[1607] but the gift of the Holy Ghost which enlightens,[1608] offered indeed by means of the word, and that, too,[1609] already by the present word with its reproof[1610] and grace.[1611] Cf. <a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>. Even here the prefixed <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡʼ ἘΜΟῦ</span></span></span> applies,[1612] for the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Christ, sent by him.[1613] The correct knowledge attained by such enlightening (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ΒΛΈΠῌς</span></span></span>) is, however, in fact, at the same time the true treasure, spiritual riches.

Priding herself not merely on the fact but (as is implied) on the means by which it had been secured (<span class="ital">viz.</span>, personal skill, merit) and finally on the independent self-reliant position thus attained: a profuse certificate of merit, selfassigned.

It is irrelevant to connect the saying with the material wealth and resources of Laodicea, as exemplified in the fact that it was rebuilt by its citizens after the earthquake in 60–61 A.D. without help from the imperial authorities (Tacit. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> xiv. 27). For one thing, the incident is too far back; for another, the Apocalypse is concerned not with the cities but with the Christian churches. Such an allusion may have been in the writer’s mind, especially if the church included in its membership prosperous and influential citizens, since complacency and self-satisfaction are fostered by material comfort. “If wealthily then happily,” in Laodicea as in Padua. Still, these weeds spring from other soils as well. An inefficient ministry (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/4-17.htm" title=" And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.">Colossians 4:17</a>) and absence of persecution or of special difficulties at Laodicea probably helped to account for the church’s languid state. As John suggests, the church which is truly rich in spiritual and moral qualities does not plume itself upon them (<a href="/revelation/2-9.htm" title="I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.">Revelation 2:9</a>). <span class="greekheb">οὐκ οἶδας</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> the echo of this in <span class="ital">Oxyrhynchite Logia</span>, i. 3: <span class="greekheb">τυφλοί εἰσιν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν καὶ οὐ βλέπ</span>[<span class="greekheb">ουσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">πτωχοὶ καὶ οὐκ οἴδασιν τ</span>]<span class="greekheb">ὴν πτωχιαν</span> (?), where blindness and poverty and unconsciousness of both occur. <span class="greekheb">σύ</span>, emphatic; <span class="greekheb">ἐλεεινός</span>, “needing pity” rather than (as <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm" title="At the beginning of your supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show you; for you are greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright: for to you am I now sent.

Hence it is not necessary to interpret these words either of material wealth, or of fancied spiritual wealth, to the exclusion of the other. St <a href="/context/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons....">James 2:1-6</a> shews that in the first century, as in the nineteenth, the “respectable” classes found it easiest to be religious, to their own satisfaction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that thou art wretched</span>] Inadequate: read <span class="bld">that thou art the wretched and miserable one</span>, &c.: the one person truly to be called so, above all others—at least, above all the other six Churches.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:">Revelation 3:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅσι λέγεις</span>) This <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is not connected with the preceding words, in which their own <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is inserted, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι χλιαρὸς εἶ</span>; but with the following words, as the thing speaks for itself.

The Epistle is still addressed indirectly to the Laodicean Church, directly to the angel. No doubt spiritual riches are immediately referred to; but spiritual pride and lukewarmness are frequently produced by worldly prosperity, such as that which Archippus (if he be the angel addressed; see on ver. 14) and the Church over which he presided enjoyed. It is not enough for the wealthy Christian to contribute a portion of his wealth, and then to consider his task done and his reward sure. Greater zeal than this is requisite before he can deem his duty discharged. Moreover, the greater the zeal that exists, the less will be the inclination to rely upon what has been accomplished, or to think it sufficient; for when all has been done we are still to call ourselves unprofitable servants (<a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>; cf. <a href="/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>, "I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin"). <span class="cmt_word">And knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked</span>; <span class="accented">and knowest not that thou, even thou thyself, art the wretched one.</span> The self-satisfied spiritual pride of the Pharisee caused him to regard with complacent pity the condition of the publican. But he was mistaken; he himself was <span class="accented">the wretched one</span>, who was to be pitied. So with the Laodicean Church. How different the conduct of St. Paul, who recognized his own wretchedness (<a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>, where the same word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used)!
