Here our Lord Jesus styles himself, The Amen; one steady and unchangeable in all his purposes and promises. If religion is worth anything, it is worth every thing. Christ expects men should be in earnest. How many professors of gospel doctrine are neither hot nor cold; except as they are indifferent in needful matters, and hot and fiery in disputes about things of lesser moment! A severe punishment is threatened. They would give a false opinion of Christianity, as if it were an unholy religion; while others would conclude it could afford no real satisfaction, otherwise its professors would not have been heartless in it, or so ready to seek pleasure or happiness from the world. One cause of this indifference and inconsistency in religion is, self-conceit and self-delusion; Because thou sayest. What a difference between their thoughts of themselves, and the thoughts Christ had of them! How careful should we be not to cheat our owns souls! There are many in hell, who once thought themselves far in the way to heaven. Let us beg of God that we may not be left to flatter and deceive ourselves. Professors grow proud, as they become carnal and formal. Their state was wretched in itself. They were poor; really poor, when they said and thought they were rich. They could not see their state, nor their way, nor their danger, yet they thought they saw it. They had not the garment of justification, nor sanctification: they were exposed to sin and shame; their rags that would defile them. They were naked, without house or harbour, for they were without God, in whom alone the soul of man can find rest and safety. Good counsel was given by Christ to this sinful people. Happy those who take his counsel, for all others must perish in their sins. Christ lets them know where they might have true riches, and how they might have them. Some things must be parted with, but nothing valuable; and it is only to make room for receiving true riches. Part with sin and self-confidence, that you may be filled with his hidden treasure. They must receive from Christ the white raiment he purchased and provided for them; his own imputed righteousness for justification, and the garments of holiness and sanctification. Let them give themselves up to his word and Spirit, and their eyes shall be opened to see their way and their end. Let us examine ourselves by the rule of his word, and pray earnestly for the teaching of his Holy Spirit, to take away our pride, prejudices, and worldly lusts. Sinners ought to take the rebukes of God's word and rod, as tokens of his love to their souls. Christ stood without; knocking, by the dealings of his providence, the warnings and teaching of his word, and the influences of his Spirit. Christ still graciously, by his word and Spirit, comes to the door of the hearts of sinners. Those who open to him shall enjoy his presence. If what he finds would make but a poor feast, what he brings will supply a rich one. He will give fresh supplies of graces and comforts. In the conclusion is a promise to the overcoming believer. Christ himself had temptations and conflicts; he overcame them all, and was more than a conqueror. Those made like to Christ in his trials, shall be made like to him in glory. All is closed with the general demand of attention. And these counsels, while suited to the churches to which they were addressed, are deeply interesting to all men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten - Of course, only on the supposition that they deserve it. The meaning is, that it is a proof of love on his part, if his professed friends go astray, to recall them by admonitions and by trials. So a father calls back his children who are disobedient; and there is no higher proof of his love than when, with great pain to himself, he administers such chastisement as shall save his child. See the sentiment here expressed fully explained in the notes on <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>. The language is taken from <a href="/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>.<p>Be zealous therefore, and repent - Be earnest, strenuous, ardent in your purpose to exercise true repentance, and to turn from the error of your ways. Lose no time; spare no labor, that you may obtain such a state of mind that it shall not be necessary to bring upon you the severe discipline which always comes on those who continue lukewarm in religion. The truth taught here is, that when the professed followers of Christ have become lukewarm in his service, they should lose no time in returning to him, anti seeking his favor again. As sure as he has any true love for them, if this is not done he will bring upon them some heavy calamity, alike to rebuke them for their errors, and to recover them to himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

But in the case of Philadelphia (Re 3:9), "I have loved thee" (Greek, "egapesa") with the love of esteem, founded on the judgment. Compare the note in my English Gnomon of Bengel, Joh 21:15-17.<p>I rebuke&#8212;The "I" in the Greek stands first in the sentence emphatically. I in My dealings, so altogether unlike man's, in the case of all whom I love, rebuke.

The Greek, "paideu," which in classical Greek means to instruct, in the New Testament means to instruct by chastisement (Heb 12:5, 6). David was rebuked unto conviction, when he cried, "I have sinned against the Lord"; the chastening followed when his child was taken from him (2Sa 12:13, 14). In the divine chastening, the sinner at one and the same time winces under the rod and learns righteousness.<p>be zealous&#8212;habitually. Present tense in the Greek, of a lifelong course of zeal. The opposite of "lukewarm." The Greek by alliteration marks this: Laodicea had not been "hot" (Greek, "zestos"), she is therefore urged to "be zealous" (Greek, "zeleue"): both are derived from the same verb, Greek, "zeo," "to boil."<p>repent&#8212;Greek aorist: of an act to be once for all done, and done at once.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I rebuke and chasten; </span> elegcw kai paideuw the words may be translated, I convince and instruct, or deal with them as children; but it also signifies to <span class="ital">chasten, </span> and is so translated, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.">1 Corinthians 11:32</a> <a href="/hebrews/12-7.htm" title="If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?">Hebrews 12:7</a></span>; we translate it <span class="ital">learn, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1 Timothy 1:20</a></span>.

The persons the objects of Christ's love here intended are not angels, but the sons of men; and these not all of them, yet many of them, even all who are his own by his Father's gift and his own purchase; and who are called his church, and sometimes represented as such who love him and obey his commands: the instances of his love to them are many; as his suretyship engagements for them, his assumption of their nature, dying in their room and stead, paying their debts, procuring their peace and pardon, bringing in a righteousness for them, purchasing their persons, his intercession for them, preparations in heaven, supplies of grace, and frequent visits in a kind and familiar manner; and as for the nature of his love, it is free and sovereign, everlasting and immutable, and it is matchless and inconceivable, it is strong and affectionate, and as his Father loved him; and such are rebuked by Christ, not in a way of wrath, but in a tender manner, in order to bring them under a conviction of their sin and of their duty, and of their folly in trusting in, or loving any creature more than himself, and of all their wrong ways; and they are chastened by him, not in a vindictive, but in a fatherly way, which is instructive and teaching to them, and for their good. This seems to refer to some afflictions which Christ was about to bring upon this church, by some means or another, to awaken her out of her sloth and security, and which would be in love to her, and the end be to rouse her zeal and bring her to repentance. Some think this respects the Gog and Magog army, which will encompass the camp of the saints, and the beloved city; but that will not be till after the thousand years' reign, and besides will be no affliction to them; rather it designs the unchurching them, signified by spewing them out of his mouth, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>, <p>be zealous, therefore, and repent; zeal was what was wanting in this church; which is nothing else than hot, fervent, and ardent love, love in a flame; whereas she was neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, Christ would have her be "zealous" for God; for his cause and interest, for his Gospel, ordinances, and the discipline of his house, and against everything that is evil; against all false worship, all errors in doctrine, all sin and iniquity; and to be zealous of good works, and in the worship of God, both private and public: and "repent"; in an evangelical way, of her lukewarnmess, remissness, and supineness; of her pride, arrogance, and vain boastings of herself; and of her self-sufficience, self-dependence, and self-confidence. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> zealous therefore, and repent.</span><p>(k) Zeal is set against those who are neither hot nor cold.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/revelation/3-19.htm" title="As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.">Revelation 3:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐγώ</span> emphatically prefixed.

Grot. says incorrectly: “<span class="greekheb">φιλῶ</span>, not absolutely, but relatively; i.e., those whom I have not altogether determined, because of their long-continued sins, to cast away and harden.” Upon a similar misunderstanding rests the remark of Vitringa, that the kind address is directed only to the better part of the church. On the contrary, the entire church is still an object of the seeking love of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχω καὶ παιδεύω</span>. The distinction between the two expressions does not lie in the <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχειν</span> occurring by means of words, and the <span class="greekheb">παιδεύειν</span> by chastisements;[1614] but the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΙΔΕΎΕΙΝ</span></span></span> designating discipline, i.e., education in general,[1615] may occur as well by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΈΓΧΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, as by perceptible chastisements, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΑΣΤΙΓΟῦΝ</span></span></span>.[1616] The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΈΓΧΕΙΝ</span></span></span>[1617] occurs when the wrong is so placed before the eyes of any one that he must acknowledge it. From <a href="/revelation/3-15.htm" title="I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I would you were cold or hot.">Revelation 3:15</a> on, the Lord has exercised his <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΈΓΧΕΙΝ</span></span></span> by completely disclosing the faults of the church; yet he expressly says that this, as well as his entire <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΙΔΕΎΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, proceeds from love. It is nowhere said that in this he has already employed, or will employ, what are the proper means of chastisement (blows). On the other hand, to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΙΔΕΎΕΙΝ</span></span></span> belongs the advice of <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm" title="I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.">Revelation 3:18</a>. Yet this advice contains the express assurance, that, with the Lord, gold, etc., shall not be lacking. Hence not only the relentless <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΈΓΧΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, but also the tendering of grace, is a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΙΔΕΎΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, which testifies to the Lord’s love. But if the Lord thus manifests himself to the “lukewarm” church, it follows that this (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΝ</span></span></span>) has to do what the command expressly says: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΉΛΕΝΕ ΟὟΝ ΚΑῚ ΜΕΤΑΝΌΗΣΟΝ</span></span></span>. The words contain not a hysteron proteron,[1618] but require of the church which is convicted of lukewarmness, an ardent zeal, enkindled by the love manifested by the Lord, and, as the proof of this zeal, a true change of mind.[1619]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1614] Blows, Luke 23; <a href="/luke/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;">Luke 16:22</a>.

Such a reproof as he has given in Christ’s name, and the discipline it involves (<span class="greekheb">παιδεύω</span>, wider than <span class="greekheb">ἐλ</span>.) are really evidence of affection, not of antipathy or rejection. This is the method of God at least (<span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>, emphatic; “whatever others do”), with whom censure does not mean hostility. <span class="greekheb">φιλῶ</span>, the substitution of this synonym (contrast <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm" title="For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and whips every son whom he receives.">Hebrews 12:6</a>) for the LXX <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷ</span> is remarkable in view of the latter term’s usage in the Apocalypse; the other variation <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχω καὶ παιδεύω</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐλ</span>.

In the latter passage, the divine love sustains and safeguards those who are loyal; here it inflicts painful wounds upon the unworthy, to regain their loyalty. <span class="greekheb">ζήλευε</span> (pres.) = a habit, <span class="greekheb">μετανόησον</span> (aor.) = a definite change once for all. The connexion (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>) seems to be: let the foregoing rebuke open your eyes at once to the need of repentance, and also to the fact that it is really love on my part which prompts me thus to expose and to chastise you; such a sense of my loving concern, as well as of your own plight, should kindle an eager heat of indignation (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.">2 Corinthians 8:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλα ζῆλον</span>) gathering into a flame of repentance that will burn up indifference and inconsistency (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Weinel, 188 f.). The urgent need of immediate repentance rests not only on the special character of the temptation to which the local Christians were succumbing (“It is a great grace to find out that we are lukewarm, but we are lost if we do not act with vigour. It is like going to sleep in the snow, almost a pleasant, tingling feeling at the first, and then—lost forever,” Faber), but on the fact that this warning was their last chance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[907] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[908] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[909] Codex Alexandrinus (sæc. v.), at the British Museum, published in photographic facsimile by Sir E.

In every other case, the Lord has noted both the good and the evil in the Church, and generally the good first: here He does nothing but find fault, but He adds in effect, “Do not suppose from this that I do not love you.” The word “rebuke” is more often rendered “reprove:” see e.g. <a href="/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm" title="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.">Ephesians 5:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-13.htm" title="But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatever does make manifest is light.">Ephesians 5:13</a> : its meaning here is exactly what we express by “working conviction of sin.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be zealous therefore, and repent</span>] Shake off thy languid “lukewarm” temper: then thou wilt be able to start on a new life of righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/revelation/3-19.htm" title="As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.">Revelation 3:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Φιλῶ</span>) In the case of the Philadelphian Church, He (<a href="/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>) <span class="greekheb">ἠγάπησε</span> (<span class="ital">esteemed</span> it): in the case of the Laodicean, He <span class="greekheb">φιλεῖ</span> (<span class="ital">loves</span> it).

This verse is a solace and encouragement for the Laodi-ceans. They were required to make the sacrifices demanded of them, not so much that they might be punished for their transgressions, but to prove themselves of the number of God's elect. The stern reproof administered was a pruning, which was an evidence of God's loving care for them; the final sentence, "Cut it down," had not yet gone forth. But though thus intended for encouragement rather than condemnation, yet it could not but contain implied reproach, however tender. No one can be exhorted to change his path and to seek that which is holy without being reminded that he is unholy and has wandered from the right way. Those in Laodicea who took this message to heart must needs think of their <span class="accented">unchastened life</span> - the life full of prosperity and self-satisfied security, into which so little <span class="accented">zeal</span> had been infused, in which so little need for <span class="accented">repentance</span> bad been felt. The Church, indeed, needed some of that chastening, that persecution, and hardship, which should arouse her from the perilous slumber of ease into which she had fallen, and call forth some zeal and self-sacrifice, the frequent and natural result of opposition. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As many as Ilove<p>In the Greek order I stands first as emphatic.<p>Rebuke (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;)<p>See on <a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>.
