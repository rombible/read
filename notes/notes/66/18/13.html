The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And cinnamon - Cinnamon is the aromatic bark of the Laurus Cinnamomam, which grows in Arabia, India, and especially in the island of Ceylon. It was formerly, as it is now, a valuable article in the Oriental trade.<p>And odours - Aromatics employed in religious worship, and for making perfumes. Mr. Gibbon (vol. i. p. 34) mentions, among the articles of commerce and luxury, in the age of the Antonines, "a variety of aromatics that were consumed in religious worship and the pomp of funerals." It is unnecessary to say that the use of such odors has been always common at Rome.<p>And ointments - Unguents - as spikenard, etc. These were in common use among the ancients. See the <a href="/matthew/14-7.htm">Matthew 14:7</a> note; <a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> note.<p>And frankincense - See the notes on <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>. It is unnecessary to say that incense has been always much used in public worship in Rome, and that it has been, therefore, a valuable article of commerce there.<p>And wine - An article of commerce and luxury in all ages.<p>And oil - That is, olive oil. This, in ancient times, and in Oriental countries particularly, was an important article of commerce.<p>And fine flour - The word here means the best and finest kind of flour.<p>And beasts, and sheep, and horses - Also important articles of merchandise.<p>And chariots - The word used here - &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  redo&#772;n - means, properly a carriage with four wheels, or a carriage drawn by mules (Prof. Stuart). It was properly a traveling carriage. The word is of Gallic origin (Quinctil. 1:9; Cic. Mil. 10; Att. v. 17; 6:1. See Adam's Rom. Ant. p. 525). It was an article of luxury.<p>And slaves - The Greek here is &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  so&#772;mato&#772;n - "of bodies." Prof. Stuart renders it "grooms," and supposes that it refers to a particular kind of slaves who were employed in taking care of horses and carriages. The word properly denotes body - an animal body - whether of the human body, living or dead, or the body of a beast; and then the external man - the person, the individual. In later usage, it comes to denote a slave (see Robinson, Lexicon), and in this sense it is used here. The traffic in slaves was common in ancient times, as it is now. We know that this traffic was carried on to a large extent in ancient Rome, the city which John probably had in his eye in this description. See Gibbon, Dec. and Fall, vol. 1, pp. 25, 26. Athenaeus, as quoted by Mr. Gibbon (p. 26), says that "he knew very many Romans who possessed, not for use, but for ostentation, ten, and even twenty thousand slaves." It should be said here, however, that although this refers evidently to traffic in slaves, it is not necessary to suppose that it would be literally characteristic of papal Rome. All this is symbolical, designed to exhibit the papacy under the image of a great city, with what was customary in such a city, or with what most naturally presented itself to the imagination of John as found in such a city; and it is no more necessary to suppose that the papacy would be engaged in the traffic of slaves, than in the traffic of cinnamon, or fine flour, or sheep and horses.<p>And souls of men - The word used and rendered "souls" - &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;  psuchas - though commonly denoting the "soul" (properly the "breath" or "vital principle"), is also employed to denote the living thing - the animal - in which the soul or vital principle resides; and hence may denote a person or a man. Under this form it is used to denote a "servant" or "slave." See Robinson, Lexicon. Prof. Robinson supposes that the word here means "female slaves," in distinction from those designated by the previous word. Prof. Stuart (in loco) supposes that the previous word denotes a particular kind of slaves - those who had the care of horses - and that the word here is used in a generic sense, denoting slaves in general. This kind of traffic in the "persons" or souls of people is mentioned as characterizing ancient Tyre, in <a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; "Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants; they traded in the persons of men." It is not quite clear why, in the passage before us, this traffic is mentioned in two forms, as that of the bodies and the souls of people but it would seem most probable that the writer meant to designate all that would properly come under this traffic, whether male or female slaves were bought and sold; whether they were for servitude, or for the gladiatorial sports (see Wetstein, in loco); whatever might be the kind of servitude that they might be employed in, and whatever might be their condition in life. The use of the two words would include all that is implied in the traffic, for, in most important senses, it extends to the body and the soul. In slavery both are purchased; both are supposed, so far as he can avail himself of them, to become the property of the master. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. cinnamon&#8212;designed by God for better purposes: being an ingredient in the holy anointing oil, and a plant in the garden of the Beloved (So 4:14); but desecrated to vile uses by the adulteress (Pr 7:17).<p>odours&#8212;of incense.

The Romish priests pretend to redeem souls out of purgatory for such a sum of money, and sell pardons and indulgences, say Mass, and promise heaven itself for money; and this they get at the expense of men's souls, by their false doctrine and superstitious worship, and so make merchandise of them, as is said of the false teachers, <a href="/2_peter/2-3.htm">2 Peter 2:3</a> moreover, as by "slaves", or bodies, in the preceding clause, are meant such who serve with their bodies, either by way of attendance, or in unnatural lust; so by "souls" of men may be meant men of soul, of great natural wit and understanding, of great parts, abilities, and learning, with which they serve the man of sin, and his interest, such as Bellarmine, and others. <p>(k) Misn.

Neither is <span class="ital">rheda</span>, or, according to Isidore, <span class="ital">reda</span>, a Greek word, as Andreas of Cæsareia sufficiently teaches on this passage, explaining <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ῬΈΔΑΝ</span></span></span>, for the sake of the Greeks, by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὌΧΗΜΑ</span></span></span>, as Theophylact does <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΥΣΤΩΔΊΑΝ</span></span></span>, by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΥΛΑΚῊΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/matthew/27-65.htm" title="Pilate said to them, You have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as you can.">Matthew 27:65</a>. Nor did <span class="ital">rheda</span> sound with less novelty among the Greeks, than that word <span class="greekheb">ὄχημα</span> would sound in the Latin language. It is owing to this that the Greek copyists wrote in this place <span class="greekheb">ῥεδῶν</span> with such variations.[203] The modern Greek version, <span class="greekheb">ἀμάξια</span>. <span class="ital">Many Gallic words prevailed, as</span> rheda, <span class="ital">which Cicero uses</span>, says Quintil. l. i. c. 5; but Isidore: <span class="ital">the reda is a kind of four-wheeled carriage; these the ancients called</span> retæ, <span class="ital">because they had</span> rotæ [wheels]: l. xx. 12. The Arabian version, better acquainted with Greek than with Latin, substituted <span class="ital">of mules and camels</span>. The word thus introduced into the Latin state, and therefore become Latin, is not without design used in this passage. This stricture indeed attacks Rome, and the luxury which is peculiar to Rome. Jerome on Isaiah 66 : <span class="ital">With Gallic waggon, and war-chariots, and horses of Cappadocia and Spain; and carriages of Italy</span> [REDIS ITALIÆ], etc. On the Hebrews, meant by the use of Hebrew words, comp. note on ch. <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>.— <span class="greekheb">καὶ σωμάτων</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ψυχὰς ἀνθρώπων</span>) The Greeks often say <span class="greekheb">σώματα</span> instead of <span class="ital">slaves</span>: <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/10-10.htm" title="Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money:">Tob 10:10</a> (11), <span class="greekheb">σώματα καὶ κτήνη καὶ ἀργύριον</span>: and thus LXX., <a href="/genesis/36-6.htm" title="And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.">Genesis 36:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">πάντα τὰ σώματα τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ</span>. The same again, <a href="/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐνεμπορεύονταί σοι ἐν ψυχαῖς ἀνθρώπων</span>. In both these passages <span class="greekheb">נפש </span>and <span class="greekheb">אדם נפש </span>are the words in the Hebrew. <span class="greekheb">Ψυχαὶ ἀνθρώπων</span> are used for <span class="ital">carcases, the dead</span>, <a href="/numbers/9-6.htm" title="And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:">Numbers 9:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm" title="He that touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.">Numbers 19:11</a>, but also for the <span class="ital">living</span>, <a href="/leviticus/24-17.htm" title="And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 24:17</a>, especially captives or <span class="ital">slaves</span>, <a href="/numbers/31-35.htm" title="And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.">Numbers 31:35</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-40.htm" title="And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons.">Numbers 31:40</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-46.htm" title="And sixteen thousand persons;)">Numbers 31:46</a>. In this passage, where merchants are introduced complaining, the <span class="ital">bodies</span> are slaves, used for carrying merchandise or their masters: <span class="ital">the souls of men</span> are slaves, in so far as they are in themselves counted as merchandise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[202] AC Vulg.
