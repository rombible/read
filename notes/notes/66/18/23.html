The apostles, who are honoured and daily worshipped at Rome in an idolatrous manner, will rejoice in her fall. The fall of Babylon was an act of God's justice. And because it was a final ruin, this enemy should never molest them any more; of this they were assured by a sign.

The origin of this representation is probably the description of Tyre in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>.<p>For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived - This is stated as a reason for the ruin that had come upon her. It is a common representation of papal Rome that she has deceived or deluded the nations of the earth (see the notes on <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>), and no representation ever made accords more with facts as they have occurred.
