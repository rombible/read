Another angel comes from heaven. This seems to be Christ himself, coming to destroy his enemies, and to shed abroad the light of his gospel through all nations. The wickedness of this Babylon was very great; she had forsaken the true God, and set up idols, and had drawn all sorts of men into spiritual adultery, and by her wealth and luxury kept them in her interest. The spiritual merchandise, by which multitudes have wickedly lived in wealth, by the sins and follies of mankind, seems principally intended. Fair warning is given to all that expect mercy from God, that they should not only come out of this Babylon, but assist in her destruction. God may have a people even in Babylon. But God's people shall be called out of Babylon, and called effectually, while those that partake with wicked men in their sins, must receive of their plagues.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And after these things - After the vision referred to in the previous chapter.<p>I saw another angel come down from heaven - Different from the one that had last appeared, and therefore coming to make a new communication to him.
