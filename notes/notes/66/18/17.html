It is the outcry of those who call to mind, with pain, a glory that was great, but now is gone. It is not to be taken as meaning “what city has suffered as she has?” but rather is it the recollection of her former splendour—“how great she was.” This lingering of the mind over delights now vanished is one subtle element of misery. So the hapless Francesca thought—<p>“There is no greater woe,<p>Than to remember days of happiness<p>Amid affliction.” <span class= "ital">Inf.</span> v. 121-3.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:9-19 The mourners had shared Babylon's sensual pleasures, and gained by her wealth and trade. The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in one hour - In a very brief period - so short, that it seemed to them to be but one hour. In the prediction <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>, it is said that it would be "in one day" (see the notes on that place); here it is said that, to the on-lookers, it seemed to be but an hour. There is no inconsistency, therefore, between the two statements.<p>So great riches is come to nought - All the accumulated wealth of so great and rich a city. This should have been united with <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-16.htm">Revelation 18:16</a>, as it is a part of the lamentation of the merchants, and as the lamentation of the mariners commences in the other part of the verse. It is so divided in the Greek Testaments.<p>And every ship-master - This introduces the lamentation of the mariners, who would, of course, be deeply interested in the destruction of a city with which they had been accustomed to trade, and by carrying merchandise to which they had been enriched. The word "ship-master" - &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  kuberne&#772;te&#772;s - means, properly, a "governor"; then a governor of a ship - the "steersman" or "pilot," <a href="/acts/27-11.htm">Acts 27:11</a>.<p>And all the company in ships - Prof. Stuart renders this "coasters." There is here, however, an important difference in the reading of the text. The commonly received text is, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  pas epi to&#772;n ploio&#772;n ho homilos - "the whole company in ships," as in our common version; the reading which is now commonly adopted, and which is found in Griesbach, Hahn, and Tittmann, is &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  ho epi topon pleo&#772;n - "he who sails to a place"; that is, he who sails from one place to another along the coast, or who does not venture out far to sea; and thus the phrase would denote a secondary class of sea-captains or officers - those less venturesome, or experienced, or bold than others. There can be little doubt that this is the correct reading (compare Wetatein, in loco); and hence the class of seamen here referred to is "coasters." Such seamen would naturally be employed where there was a great and luxurious maritime city, and would have a deep interest in its fall.<p>And sailors - Common seamen.<p>And as many as trade by sea - In any kind of craft, whether employed in a near or a remote trade.<p>Stood afar off - notes on <a href="/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. is come to naught&#8212;Greek, "is desolated."<p>shipmaster&#8212;Greek, "steersman," or "pilot."<p>all the company in ships&#8212;A, C, Vulgate, and Syriac read, "Every one who saileth to a place" (B has "&#8230; to the place"), every voyager.

The Authorized Version has little support. The Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">And every one that saileth anywhither. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And sailors, and as many as trade by sea;</span> <span class="accented">as many as work the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> gain their living by means of the sea. Thus are enumerated all who are connected with the sea in any capacity (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stood afar off.</span> Like the kings (ver. 10) and the merchants (ver. 15), and doubtless for the same reason; viz. to avoid being overwhelmed in the destruction of the city. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shipmaster (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9; to govern.
