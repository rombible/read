Jeremiah enjoined Seraiah to bind the prophetic roll to a great stone, and cast them together into the Euphrates. The meaning of the act was explained—“Thus shall Babylon sink and shall not rise,” &c. (<a href="/context/jeremiah/51-63.htm" title="And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of Euphrates:">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>). The great dead mass, sinking helplessly by the law of its own weight, signified a fall past recovery. So Pharaoh and his host sank like lead in the mighty waters. It is the doom Christ foreshadowed as awaiting those who caused His children to fall (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm" title="But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.">Matthew 18:6</a>). The mighty angel, strong to lift the ponderous stone, throws it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence (or, <span class= "ital">with a bound</span>) shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown, and shall not be found any more. At one bound, without a single resting-stage in its downward career, without chance or power of recovery, the vast world-city would fall. She who sat as a queen upon many waters, sinks as a stone in the mighty waters. She will not be found any more. The words “any more,” or “no more,” are repeated in these verses no less than six times, like a funeral knell over the departed greatness which is described.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:20-24 That which is matter of rejoicing to the servants of God on earth, is matter of rejoicing to the angels in heaven. The apostles, who are honoured and daily worshipped at Rome in an idolatrous manner, will rejoice in her fall. The fall of Babylon was an act of God's justice. And because it was a final ruin, this enemy should never molest them any more; of this they were assured by a sign. Let us take warning from the things which brought others to destruction, and let us set our affections on things above, when we consider the changeable nature of earthly things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And a mighty angel - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a>.

This accords with all the representations in this book, that violence will be employed to overthrow the papal power. See <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16-17</a>. The origin of this image is probably <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>; "And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates; and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring on her." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. a&#8212;Greek, "one."<p>millstone&#8212;Compare the judgment on the Egyptian hosts at the Red Sea, Ex 15:5, 10; Ne 9:11, and the foretold doom of Babylon, the world power, Jer 51:63, 64.<p>with violence&#8212;Greek, "with impetus."

Finally, a mighty angel in representing the impending sudden destruction of the great city, by casting a great stone into the sea, not only in his speech explaining this symbolical act, describes, by individual vivid features, the transformation into desolate silence of the pleasure and magnificence that have hitherto prevailed, but also points definitely to the guilt of the city as the ground of the judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ἄγγελος ἰσχυοὸς</span>.

By the comparison <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ῶς ΜΎΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΜΈΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, the greatness of the stone is illustrated.[4004] The meaning of the act[4005] is described well by Andr., since he holds to the literal interpretation of the angel: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘἈΠΕΡ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΦΗΣῚΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ΜΎΛΟς ΚΑΤΑΔΎΕΙ ὉΡΜΉΜΑΤΙ ΕἸς ΤῊΝ ΘΆΛΑΣΣΑΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΟὝΤΩ ΚΑῚ Ἡ Τῆς ΒΑΒΥΛῶΝΟς ΤΑΎΤΗς ἈΘΡΌΟΝ ἜΣΤΑΙ ΚΑΘΑΊΡΕΣΙς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὬΣΤΕ ΜΉΤΕ ἼΧΝΟς ΑὐΤῆς ΦΥΛΑΧΘῆΝΑΙ ΕἸς ΤῸ ΜΕΤΈΠΕΙΤΑ</span></span></span>.[4006] Here it is likewise remarkable that Andr. does not see that he is led to substitute for the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΜΎΛΟς</span></span></span>, which is unusual as a designation of a millstone, that which is ordinarily employed, and how he correctly paraphrases the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΜΉΜΑΤΙ</span></span></span>[4007] by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΘΡΌΟΝ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Concerning <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΜῊ</span></span></span> with aor. subj., <a href="/revelation/18-21.htm" title="And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.">Revelation 18:21</a> sqq.,[4008] see Winer, p. 471.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The description, <a href="/revelation/18-22.htm" title="And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsman, of whatever craft he be, shall be found any more in you; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you;">Revelation 18:22</a> sqq., which refers not only to objects of pleasure and luxury, but also to daily wants and natural relations of life, has the model of <a href="/ezekiel/26-13.htm" title="And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard.">Ezekiel 26:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-10.htm" title="Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.">Jeremiah 25:10</a>,[4009] as its foundation; the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΡΉΜΩΣΙς</span></span></span> of the city (<a href="/revelation/18-16.htm" title="And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!">Revelation 18:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-19.htm" title="And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.">Revelation 18:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-16.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.">Revelation 17:16</a>)[4010] is illustrated in a concrete way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Πᾶς ΤΕΧΝΊΤΗς ΠΑΣ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤΈΧΝΗς</span></span></span>.

This, however, is stated in a threefold way from <a href="/revelation/18-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.">Revelation 18:1</a> on:[4012] first, the unprecedented luxury in which the city had indulged, because of its wealth;[4013] then the licentiousness into which she had led astray all nations and kings, as she brought all the world thither to her service and to acknowledge her as the divine queen;[4014] finally, her bloody hostility to the saints.[4015] All three points[4016] the angel emphasizes, sealing, as it were, his announcement of judgment with this establishment of guilt; the first, in the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΟἹ ἜΜΠΟΡΟΊ ΣΟΥ ἮΣΑΝ ΟἹ ΜΕΓΙΣΤᾶΝΕς Τῆς Γῆς</span></span></span>,[4017] “because thy merchants were the great men of the earth,” i.e., because they who brought thee the objects of thy luxurious life found in thy wealth and extravagance a source of their own wealth, which made them the great men of the earth;[4018] the second, in the words <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν τῇ φαρμακείᾳ σου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., which cannot be understood as a foundation of what immediately precedes,[4019] but are co-ordinate with the first expression <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οἱ ἔαποροι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., since here the same object is described as in <a href="/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm" title="And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:">Revelation 17:4</a>, and the seductive sorcery[4020] is in fact nothing else than the intoxicating wine of the harlot.
