The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The merchants of these things - Who trafficked in these things, and who supplied the city with them, <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11</a>.<p>Which were made rich by her - By traffic with her.<p>Shall stand afar off - <a href="/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10</a>.<p>For fear of her torment - Struck with terror by her torment, so that they did not dare to approach her, <a href="/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. of these things&#8212;of the things mentioned, Re 18:12, 13.<p>which&#8212;"who."<p>made rich by&#8212;Greek, "derived riches from her."<p>stand afar off for the fear&#8212;(Compare Re 18:10).<p>wailing&#8212;Greek, "mourning."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not knowing how to help her, and fearing lest the buyers and sellers should he punished both alike; yet bewailing themselves that their trading is destroyed, and they are like to buy such pennyworths no more. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The merchants of these things,....
