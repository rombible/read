The kings of the earth, whom she flattered into idolatry, allowing them to be tyrannical over their subjects, while obedient to her; and the merchants, those who trafficked for her indulgences, pardons, and honours; these mourn. Babylon's friends partook her sinful pleasures and profits, but are not willing to share her plagues. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly spirit, and that sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they do not lament for the anger of God, but for the loss of outward comforts. The magnificence and riches of the ungodly will avail them nothing, but will render the vengeance harder to be borne. The spiritual merchandise is here alluded to, when not only slaves, but the souls of men, are mentioned as articles of commerce, to the destroying the souls of millions. Nor has this been peculiar to the Roman antichrist, and only her guilt. But let prosperous traders learn, with all their gains, to get the unsearchable riches of Christ; otherwise; even in this life, they may have to mourn that riches make to themselves wings and fly away, and that all the fruits their souls lusted after, are departed from them. Death, at any rate, will soon end their commerce, and all the riches of the ungodly will be exchanged, not only for the coffin and the worm, but for the fire that cannot be quenched.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the fruits that thy soul lusted after - Literally, "the fruits of the desire of thy soul." The word rendered "fruits" - &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  opo&#772;ra - properly means, "late summer; dog-days," the time when Sirius, or the Dog-star, is predominant. In the East this is the season when the fruits ripen, and hence the word comes to denote fruit. The reference is to any kind of fruit that would be brought for traffic into a great city, and that would be regarded as an article of luxury.<p>Are departed from thee - That is, they are no more brought for sale into the city.<p>And all things which were dainty and goodly - These words "characterize all kinds of furniture and clothing which were gilt, or plated, or embroidered, and therefore were bright or splendid" (Prof. Stuart).<p>And thou shalt find them no more at all - The address here is decidedly to the city itself.

Only here in the New Testament. Compare the compound &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; autumn (trees).

Hence, literally, fat. Only here in the New Testament. Homer uses it once in the sense of oily or shiny with oil, as the skin anointed after a bath. "Their heads and their fair faces shining" ("Odyssey," xv., 332). So Aristophanes ("Plutus," 616), and of oily, unctuous dishes ("Frogs," 163). Of the oily smoothness of a calm sea, as by Theocritus. The phrase &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; shining feet, i.e., smooth, without wrinkle, is frequent in Homer. Thus, of Agamemnon rising from his bed. "Beneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals" ("Iliad," ii., 44). Also of the condition of life; rich, comfortable: so Homer, of a prosperous old age, "Odyssey," xi., 136. Of things, bright, fresh. Of soil, fruitful. The city of Athens was called &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, a favorite epithet. Aristophanes plays upon the two senses bright and greasy, saying that if any one flatteringly calls Athens bright, he attaches to it the honor of sardines - oiliness ("Acharnians," 638, 9).<p>Goodly (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;)<p>A too indefinite rendering. Better, Rev., sumptuous. See on <a href="/luke/23-11.htm">Luke 23:11</a>; see on <a href="/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>. Mostly in the New Testament of clothing.
