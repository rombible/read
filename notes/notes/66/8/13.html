Several interpreters suppose this part of the vision to be a representation of some faithful witnesses against the superstition, idolatry, and growing corruptions of those times; and that the dreadfulness of the woes of the three remaining trumpets is proclaimed to the corrupt members of the church, because as they were endued, by the divine revelation, with more knowledge than before, being all Christians by name, they therefore deserved to suffer more for their crimes than plain heathen, such as were chiefly concerned in the former judgments. Be this as it may, whether this angel was designed to represent any such faithful witnesses against these corruptions, and to signify that such should arise, or not, it must at least be allowed, as Bishop Newton observes, that the design of this messenger, in conformity with the design of the angels that sounded the preceding trumpets, was to raise men’s attention especially to the three following trumpets, predicting events of a more calamitous nature, or more terrible plagues, than any of the preceding, and therefore distinguished from them by the name of <span class="ital">woes. </span>And they are not woes of a light or common nature, but such in the extreme; for the Hebrews, having no superlative degree, in the manner of other languages, express their superlative by repeating the positive three times, as in this place. The foregoing calamities relate chiefly to the downfall of the western empire, the two following to the downfall of the eastern empire. The foregoing are described more succinctly, and contain a less compass of time; the following are set forth with more particular circumstances, and are of longer duration, as well as larger description. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:7-13 The first angel sounded the first trumpet, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood. A storm of heresies, a mixture of dreadful errors falling on the church, or a tempest of destruction. The second angel sounded, and a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood. By this mountain some understand leaders of the persecutions; others, Rome sacked by the Goths and Vandals, with great slaughter and cruelty. The third angel sounded, and there fell a star from heaven. Some take this to be an eminent governor; others take it to be some person in power who corrupted the churches of Christ. The doctrines of the gospel, the springs of spiritual life, comfort, and vigour, to the souls of men, are corrupted and made bitter by the mixture of dangerous errors, so that the souls of men find ruin where they sought refreshment. The fourth angel sounded, and darkness fell upon the great lights of heaven, that give light to the world, the sun, and the moon, and the stars. The guides and governors are placed higher than the people, and are to dispense light, and kind influences to them. Where the gospel comes to a people, and has not proper effects on their hearts and lives, it is followed with dreadful judgments. God gives alarm by the written word, by ministers, by men's own consciences, and by the signs of the times; so that if people are surprised, it is their own fault. The anger of God makes all comforts bitter, and even life itself burdensome. But God, in this world, sets bounds to the most terrible judgments. Corruption of doctrine and worship in the church are great judgments, and also are the usual causes and tokens of other judgments coming on a people. Before the other three trumpets were sounded, there was solemn warning how terrible the calamities would be that should follow. If lesser judgments do not take effect the church and the world must expect greater; and when God comes to punish the world, the inhabitants shall tremble before him. Let sinners take warning to flee from the wrath to come; let believers learn to value and to be thankful for their privileges; and let them patiently continue in well doing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I beheld - My attention was attracted by a new vision.<p>And heard an angel flying, ... - I heard the voice of an angel making this proclamation.<p>Woe, woe, woe - That is, there will be great woe. The repetition of the word is intensive, and the idea is, that the sounding of the three remaining trumpets would indicate great and fearful calamities. These three are grouped together as if they pertained to a similar series of events, as the first four had been. The two classes are separated from each other by this interval and by this proclamation - implying that the first series had been completed, and that there would be some interval, either of space or time, before the other series would come upon the world. All that is fairly implied here would be fulfilled by the supposition that the former referred to the West, and that the latter pertained to the East, and were to follow when those should have been completed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. an angel&#8212;A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic read for "angel," which is supported by none of the oldest manuscripts, "an eagle": the symbol of judgment descending fatally from on high; the king of birds pouncing on the prey.

From the sounding of the fourth trumpet, to the sounding of the fifth, was a space of a hundred and thirty five years, that is, from the deposition of Augustulus, A.

Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.">Revelation 12:12</a>—though as usual one series of phenomena melts irregularly at the close into another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">an angel</span>] Read, <span class="bld">an eagle</span>: or more literally <span class="bld">one eagle</span>. But apparently there was a tendency in late Hebrew for the numeral to sink, as in modern languages, into a mere indefinite article; and here, and perhaps in one or two other places, we seem to have it so used in the N. T.: e.g. <a href="/matthew/8-19.htm" title="And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.">Matthew 8:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-69.htm" title="Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.">Matthew 26:69</a>, and probably <a href="/revelation/9-18.htm" title="By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.">Revelation 9:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through the midst of heaven</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">in mid-heaven</span>: it is a single compound word. It occurs again in <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm" title="And I saw another angel fly in the middle of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,">Revelation 14:6</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm" title="And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the middle of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;">Revelation 19:17</a>, and nowhere else in the N. T.: but in the later classical Greek it is not uncommon for the position of the sun at noonday. Yet the last of the places cited from this book, where all natural birds are said to fly “in mid-heaven,” seems rather as if St John used it of the <span class="ital">air</span>, the space between earth and sky.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Woe, woe, woe</span>] We see by <a href="/revelation/9-12.htm" title="One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.">Revelation 9:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/11-14.htm" title="The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.">Revelation 11:14</a> that three <span class="ital">distinct</span> woes are meant, one for each of the three trumpets.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/revelation/8-13.htm" title="And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the middle of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!">Revelation 8:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀετοῦ</span>) Others, <span class="greekheb">ἀγγέλου</span>.[94] But see App. Crit. Ed. ii. on this passage. The <span class="ital">Italian</span> Version, and other most ancient authorities, widely apart from each other in age and clime, and in very great numbers, clearly vindicate the reading <span class="greekheb">ἀετοῦ</span> from all suspicion of a gloss. <span class="ital">Another angel flying in the midst of heaven</span>, ch. <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm" title="And I saw another angel fly in the middle of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,">Revelation 14:6</a>, altogether refers to the present passage: but the reading <span class="greekheb">ἀετοῦ</span> does not destroy this reference. The very appellation, an <span class="ital">eagle</span>, and not an <span class="ital">angel</span>, in this former passage, shows that it is not an <span class="ital">angel</span>, in the proper sense’ of the expression, who is meant; and the reference in the other passage to this former one teaches, that by the word <span class="ital">another angel</span> is denoted, an illustrious herald belonging to the human race, as distinguished interpreters acknowledge.—<span class="greekheb">μεσουρανήματι</span>) <span class="greekheb">Μεσουράνημα</span> is a verbal, derived from the verb <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΣΟΥΡΑΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, which is said respecting a star which has risen three signs of the zodiac before the sun, and thus possesses the meridian, as Tzetzes demonstrates in his Exegesis of Hesiod, on the passage,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[94] AB Vulg. Memph. Syr. support <span class="greekheb">ἀετοῦ</span>. Rec.

The second woe is more disastrous than the first; the third than the second.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span>, <span class="ital">upon the earth</span>) D. Lange says: Bengel <span class="ital">not only refers to past times the three woes, which refer to the vengeance yet to come upon the beast and the whore, but he also recalls the beginning of the papacy itself to the third woe, and so declares that the third woe has come a thousand years ago, and more than this. But when it is said of the second woe</span>, <a href="/revelation/11-14.htm" title="The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.">Revelation 11:14</a>, “The second woe is past; behold the third woe cometh quickly:” <span class="ital">and immediately after the seventh trumpet follows, which refers to the completion of the judgments, and the enlargement of the kingdom of Christ, it can easily be imagined that the third woe cannot be thrown back so far</span>.—Epicr. p. 406. I reply: The three woes have reference to the <span class="ital">inhabiters of the earth;</span> and I have shown that they have come long ago, and that the third woe has come, not indeed a thousand years ago, but yet almost eight hundred. The trumpet of the seventh angel, after the second woe is past, first sets forth things which are most desirable: then it describes the <span class="ital">third</span> woe; and when that is exhausted, a completion of the judgments is made and an enlargement of the kingdom of Christ. The interpretation of the Divine of Halle changes this order; and, without any cause, restricts the three woes denounced against <span class="ital">the inhabiters of earth</span> to the last times of the enemies; and accounts as the second woe the rage of the beast, which is really in the third woe. By which method the well-arranged order of the text is violently disjointed.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς σάλπιγγος</span>, of the <span class="ital">trumpet</span>) The singular number, put distributively for the plural, <span class="ital">of the trumpets</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld, and heard an angel.</span> "An eagle" (Revised Version) is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, etc., while "angel" is found in P, 1, 16, 34, 47, etc. One manuscript (13) has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. St. John sees <span class="accented">one eagle</span>, the symbol of what is swift and unerring in swooping upon its prey. Thus <a href="/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, "The eagle that hasteth to the prey" (see also <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). This is the meaning of the appearance of <span class="accented">the eagle</span>, which announces the swiftness and certainty of the coming woes. De Wette and others unnecessarily understand "an angel in the form of an eagle." De Lyra interprets it as St. John himself. Wordsworth, relying chiefly on the force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>, believes that Christ is signified; but it is extremely doubtful whether the force of the numeral can be pressed so far. Others see a reference to the Roman legions, etc. The figure may have been suggested by <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Flying through the midst of heaven;</span> <span class="accented">flying in mid heaven</span> (Revised Version). Not "midway between earth and heaven," but "in the direct line of the sun." The word is found only here and in <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a> and Revelation 19:17. In the former it is rendered as in this place, in the latter it is translated "in the sun." The eagle is thus plainly visible to all. <span class="cmt_word">Saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth!</span> "Woe" is followed by "inhabiters" in the accusative case, according to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B; though the dative is read in A, P, and some cursives. "The inhabiters of the earth" are the ungodly, the worldly, those on whom God's wrath had been invoked by the saints at rest (<a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>), whose prayer is now answered The triple denunciation renders the threatened judgments more emphatic and terrible. <span class="cmt_word">By reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound;</span> Greek, <span class="accented">out of the other voices</span> (denoting front whence the woe proceeds) <span class="accented">who are yet to sound.</span> "Trumpet," in the singular, because taken distributively - "of each trumpet."
