The first is <span class= "ital">purity</span>: they are virgins. The expression can hardly be limited to the unmarried, as the 144,000 represent the wide society of the choice ones of God. They are those whose hearts have been made as the hearts of little children (<a href="/context/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?">Matthew 18:1-4</a>), who have that purity of heart which Christ declared to be blessed, and which St. James declared to be the first mark of heavenly wisdom (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>, and <a href="/james/3-17.htm" title="But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.">James 3:17</a>). The next is <span class= "ital">implicit obedience:</span> they follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. Some, indeed, take this to be a kind of heavenly reward: they shall be the nearer companions of the Lamb. But it is better to take it as describing their complete consecration to Christ. They are those who are with Christ, who have tasted the cup that their Lord tasted, and have taken up their cross and followed Him (<a href="/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22</a>; <a href="/luke/14-27.htm" title="And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:27</a>; <a href="/context/john/12-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.">John 12:24-26</a>). It is well to weigh these words; it is in the “wheresoever” that we may test the reality of our Christian life. Here lies the cross that Christ bids us take up. Here is the echo of Christ’s words, “Whosoever forsaketh not all he hath cannot be My disciple.” The third mark is <span class= "ital">separation, </span>or unworldliness: they were purchased from among men, as a firstfruit to God and to the Lamb. They were a chosen generation, a peculiar people (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1Peter 2:9</a>), as the Israel of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The fourth feature is <span class= "ital">utter truthfulness:</span> in their mouth no guile or no falsehood. (Comp. Psalms 14 and <a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1-2</a>.) The verse emphatically ends with “They are blameless.” The words “before the throne of God” must be omitted. (Comp. <a href="/context/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14-15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; and <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>.)<p>We have seen the servants of God; we have marked their character; we are now to see the weapon which is to be employed in the conflict against the enemies of Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 Mount Sion is the gospel church. Christ is with his church, and in the midst of her in all her troubles, therefore she is not consumed. His presence secures perseverance. His people appear honourably. They have the name of God written in their foreheads; they make a bold and open profession of their faith in God and Christ, and this is followed by suitable actings. There were persons in the darkest times, who ventured and laid down their lives for the worship and truth of the gospel of Christ. They kept themselves clean from the wicked abominations of the followers of antichrist. Their hearts were right with God; and they were freely pardoned in Christ; he is glorified in them, and they in him. May it be our prayer, our endeavour, our ambition, to be found in this honourable company. Those who are really sanctified and justified are meant here, for no hypocrite, however plausible, can be accounted to be without fault before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These are they - In this verse, and in the following verse, the writer states the leading characteristics of those who are saved. The general idea is, that they are chaste; that they are the followers of the Lamb; that they are redeemed from among people; and that they are without guile.<p>Which were not defiled with women - Who were chaste. The word "defiled" here determines the meaning of the passage, as denoting that they were not guilty of illicit sexual intercourse with women. It is unnecessary to show that this is a virtue everywhere required in the Bible, and everywhere stated as among the characteristics of the redeemed. On no point are there more frequent exhortations in the Scriptures than on this; on no point is there more solicitude manifested that the professed friends of the Saviour should be without blame. Compare the <a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a> note; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-32</a> notes; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a> note; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a> note. See also <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>. This passage cannot be adduced in favor of celibacy, whether among the clergy or laity, or in favor of monastic principles in any form; for the thing that is specified is, that they were not "defiled with women," and a lawful connection of the sexes, such as marriage, is not defilement. See the notes on <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>. The word rendered here "defiled" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  emolunthe&#772;san, from &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  moluno&#772; - is a word that cannot be applied to the marriage relation. It means properly to "soil, to stain, to defile." <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>; "their conscience being weak, is defiled." <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>; "which have not defiled their garments." The word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament, except in the passage before us, and it will be seen at once that it cannot be applied to that which is lawful and proper, and consequently that it cannot be construed as an expression against marriage and in favor of celibacy. It is a word that is properly expressive of illicit sexual intercourse - of impurity and unchastity of life - and the statement is, that they who are saved are not impure and unchaste.<p>For they are virgins - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  parthenoi. This is the masculine form, but this form is found in the later Greek and in the Christian fathers. See Suidas and Suicer, Thes. The meaning of the word, when found in the feminine form, is well understood. It denotes a virgin, a maiden, and thence it is used to denote what is chaste and pure: virgin modesty; virgin gold; virgin soil; virgin blush; virgin shame. The word in the masculine form must have a similar meaning as applied to men, and may denote:<p>(a) those who are unmarried;<p>(b) those who are chaste and pure in general.<p>The word is applied by Suidas to Abel and Melchizedek. "The sense," says DeWette, in loco, "cannot be that all these 144,000 had lived an unmarried life; for how could the apostle Peter, and others who were married, have been excluded? But the reference must be to those who held themselves from all impurity - "unkeuschheit und hurerei" - which, in the view of the apostles, was closely connected with idolatry." Compare Bleek, Beitr. i. 185. Prof. Stuart supposes that the main reference here is to those who had kept themselves from idolatry, and who were thus pure. It seems to me, however, that the most obvious meaning is the correct one, that it refers to the redeemed as chaste, and thus brings into view one of the prominent things in which Christians are distinguished from the devotees of nearly every other form of religion, and, indeed, exclusively from the world at large. This passage, also, cannot be adduced in favor of the monastic system, because:<p>(a) whatever may be said anywhere of the purity of virgins, there is no such commendation of it as to imply that the married life is impure;<p>(b) it cannot be supposed that God meant in any way to reflect on the married life as in itself impure or dishonorable;<p>(c) the language does not demand such an interpretation; and,<p>(d) the facts in regard to the monastic life have shown that it has had very little pretensions to a claim of virgin purity.<p>These are they which follow the Lamb - This is another characteristic of those who are redeemed - that they are followers of the Lamb of God. That is, they are his disciples; they imitate his example; they obey his instructions; they yield to his laws; they receive him as their counselor and their guide. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>.<p>Whithersoever he goeth - As sheep follow the shepherd. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>. It is one characteristic of true Christians that they follow the Saviour wherever he leads them. Be it into trouble, into danger, into difficult duty; be it in Christian or pagan lands; be it in pleasant paths, or in roads rough and difficult, they commit themselves wholly to his guidance, and submit themselves wholly to his will.<p>These were redeemed from among men - This is another characteristic of those who are seen on Mount Zion. They are there because they are redeemed, and they have the character of the redeemed. They are not there in virtue of rank or blood <a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; not on the ground of their own works <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>; but because they are redeemed unto God by the blood of his Son. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-10</a>. None will be there of whom it cannot be said that they are "redeemed"; none will be absent who have been truly redeemed from sin.<p>Being the first-fruits unto God - On the meaning of the word "first-fruits," see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>. The meaning here would seem to be, that the hundred and forty-four thousand were not to be regarded as the whole of the number that was saved, but that they were representatives of the redeemed. They had the same characteristics which all the redeemed must have; they were a pledge that all the redeemed would be there. Prof. Stuart supposes that the sense is, that they were, as it were, "an offering especially acceptable to God." The former explanation, however, meets all the circumstances of the case, and is more in accordance with the usual meaning of the word.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. virgins&#8212;spiritually (Mt 25:1); in contrast to the apostate Church, Babylon (Re 14:8), spiritually "a harlot" (Re 17:1-5; Isa 1:21; contrast 2Co 11:2; Eph 5:25-27).

For first of all, as the foundation of the whole history, is described the standing of the Lamb with his army and retinue in five verses, after his worthy acts which he has done and yet does in most mighty manner, while he overthrows Antichrist with the spirit of his mouth, in the rest of this chapter and in the two following. To the description of the Lamb, are propounded three things: his situation, place and attendance: for the rest are expounded in the former visions, especially in the fifth chapter.<p>(2) Prepared to do his office see Ac 7:56, in the midst of the church, which mount Zion pictured before.<p>(3) This retinue of the Lamb is described first by divine mark<p>(as before in) Re 7:2 in this verse.

They followed the Lamb as a guide to all goodness, cleaved to him and are holy to him, as by grace redeemed by him.

The disposition attempted now also by Ew. ii., whereby three members appear (1. <span class="greekheb">οὐτοί εἰσ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; 2. <span class="greekheb">οὖτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰσ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; 3. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">στόμ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), is in violation of the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ μετὰ γυναικῶν οὑκ ἐμολύνθησαν</span>. According to <a href="/leviticus/15-18.htm" title="The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:18</a>, the sexual union in itself, even that in wedlock, was regarded as defiling.[3446]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΘΈΝΟΙ</span></span></span>. This predicate was not seldom ascribed also to men.[3447] In order to avoid the thoughts forced from the word, and not seldom made the best of by Catholic interpreters in the sense of monastic asceticism,[3448] it is regarded either directly as figurative,[3449] and referring to spiritual purity, especially to abstaining from the worship of idols,[3450] or, if we abide by the proper sense of the words, to sexual purity, as an example of all virtues.[3451] Hofm. attempts to remove the difficulty by saying that the declaration is concerning believers of the last time,[3452] to whom celibacy will become a moral necessity, because of the special circumstances of those times. But nothing is said here concerning Christians of that time. The expedient of Bleek[3453] and De Wette, who regard it as referring to abstinence from all lewdness, as it was ordinarily combined with the worship of idols, is forbidden by the expression <span class="greekheb">μετὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γυναικῶν</span>, which is altogether general.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nothing else seems to remain than with Augustine,[3454] Jerome,[3455] Beda, Andr., to explain it in the proper sense, and to acknowledge the idea, to which also other points in the text lead,[3456] that entire abstinence from all sexual intercourse belongs to the distinguished holiness of that one hundred and forty-four thousand,[3457] because of which they enjoy also distinguished blessedness. [See Note LXXV., p. 404.] This is declared by the words immediately following: <span class="greekheb">οὖτοι εἰσιν οἱ ἀκολουθοῦντες τῷ ἀρνίῳ ὅπου ἂν ὑπάγει</span>. There is generally found here a description of the obedience of believers who follow the Lamb even to the cross and to death;[3458] but because of the present tense, which here expresses the present condition,—while the holy manifestation in the earthly life is designated by the aor.,—there can be meant only a description of the blessed reward which those who have died are enjoying[3459] with the Lamb.[3460] It is meant that everywhere whither the Lamb goes, there that chosen one hundred and forty-four thousand accompany him; whether it be that a certain space in heaven remain inaccessible to other saints, or that the latter do not form the constant retinue of the Lamb, at least not in the same way as the former.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὙΤΟΙ ἨΓΟΡΆΣΘΗΣΑΝ</span> Ἀ̓<span class="greekheb">ΠῸ ΤῶΝ ἈΝΘΡΏΠΩΝ ἈΠΑΡΧῊ Τῷ Θ</span>., <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> What applies to all the redeemed, viz., that they have been bought unto God by the blood of the Lamb, from among men, of the earth (<a href="/revelation/14-3.htm" title="And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.">Revelation 14:3</a>), or from all nations and kindreds (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>), applies in an eminent sense to the one hundred and forty-four thousand: they are bought as an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΑΡΧΉ</span></span></span>. They appear, therefore, not as the select first fruits from the entire world,[3461] but from believers, or, at any rate, from the blessed. The correlate to the <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχή</span> is afforded by the context: <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἠγορασμένων</span>. As such select first fruits the one hundred and forty-four thousand appear, with respect both to their peculiar holiness (<span class="greekheb">παρθένοι</span>), and also their peculiar blessedness (<span class="greekheb">ἀκολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρν</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Besides distinguished virginity, in <a href="/revelation/14-5.htm" title="And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.">Revelation 14:5</a> another peculiar perfection is mentioned, which that multitude had manifested in their earthly life (<span class="greekheb">εὑρέθη</span>, aor.); viz., perfect truthfulness never clouded by a lie. The expression <span class="greekheb">ψεῦδος</span>[3462] is to be taken in its general sense, and not to be limited to the lies of idolatry,[3463] heresy, or denial of Christ.[3464] A contrast is easily conceivable to the sphere of falsehood in which the seducing false prophet[3465] moves, with the worshippers of the beast accepting his lies.[3466] Cf. also, in <a href="/revelation/9-21.htm" title="Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.">Revelation 9:21</a>, in an enumeration of the characteristic sins of the inhabitants of the earth, the juxtaposition of <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> and <span class="greekheb">κλέμματα</span>.[3467]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄμωμοι γάρ εἰσιν</span>.

Possibly the too far-reaching statement of the writer of the Apocalypse is occasioned by the fact that he wishes to emphasize in the highest degree the contrast with the worshippers of the beast, i.e., the Gentiles, with their sexual abominations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3458] Cf. <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>.

It was adopted in ecclesiastical language, and applied e.g. to St John himself. It is best to understand the word literally. St <a href="/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.

No disparagement of holy matrimony is implied. Marriage is lowered by the Fall from what God meant it to be (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>), and so, like other things which God made very good, has its own evils and dangers; but it does not follow that it is here conceived as in any sense defilement—they who are virgins <span class="ital">à fortiori</span> are “not defiled with women.” It is noticeable that we owe to the two celibate apostles the highest consecration of marriage, see <a href="/context/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body....">Ephesians 5:23-33</a>, and the last two chapters of this Book.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">being the firstfruits</span>] This seems to imply, as is required by the view that “virgins” strictly speaking are meant, that the 144,000 do not represent the <span class="ital">whole</span> number of the Elect, but a specially sanctified number from among them. See on <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.</span> There is little doubt that these words are intended in a spiritual sense. In the Old Testament the employment of the figure of adultery and fornication to denote spiritual unfaithfulness is common (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-9.htm">Jeremiah 3:9</a>, etc.). St. John elsewhere in the Apocalypse makes use of the same symbolism (cf. <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>," That woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols;" also <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5, 6</a>). Similarly, also, St. John pictures the faithful Church as the bride adorned for her Husband the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). So also St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), "I espoused you as a chaste virgin to one Husband, Christ." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "virgins," is a word equally applicable to men or women. This verse, therefore, seems to describe those who are free from spiritual impurity and unfaithfulness; those who have not worshipped the beast and his image. Alford, however, thinks the words should be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.</span> These words describe the great source of the bliss of the redeemed, viz. that they are continually in the presence of Christ. This is their reward for following him on earth; but the words must not be taken as referring to the earthly course of the saints (as Bengel, De Wette, Hengstenberg, and others). <span class="cmt_word">These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">these were purchased from among men, the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</span> Some have erroneously concluded that a reference is made to a portion of the redeemed to whom special honour is conceded; or to some who attain to glory before the rest. <span class="accented">The firstfruits</span> were the best of their kind (<a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>), selected from the rest, and consecrated to the service of God. So the redeemed are the best of their kind; they who have proved themselves faithful to God, who voluntarily separated themselves from the world, and consecrated themselves to the service of God while in the world, and who are thus afterwards separated by him and consecrated to his service forever. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Were not defiled (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb means properly to besmear or besmirch, and is never used in a good sense, as &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (<a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>; Jde 1:8), which in classical Greek is sometimes applied to staining with color.
