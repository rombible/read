And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came forth blood out of the winepress as far as the bridles of the horses, from a thousand six hundred furlongs</span> (stadii). The outflow of the blood of the grapes pressed reached over a distance of sixteen hundred stadii. The treading of the winepress was a figure representing vengeance; the red juice of the grape strongly suggested the shedding of blood. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/63-2.htm" title="Why are you red in your apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the winefat?">Isaiah 63:2-4</a>.) The winepresses stood usually outside the city: it is so represented here, not without an allusion to those who fall under the weight of this judgment because they have refused the defence of the true city and sanctuary. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a> and <a href="/context/psalms/132-17.htm" title="There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.">Psalm 132:17-18</a>.) The distance (sixteen hundred stadii), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>four multiplied into itself and then multiplied by a hundred, is symbolical (such seems the most probable meaning) of a judgment complete and full, and reaching to all corners of the earth—“the whole world, of which Satan is called the prince, is judged, and condemned, and punished” (Dr. Currey). In the vintage and harvest is a piercing discrimination between the faithful fruit-bearing children of the King and the cowardly or selfish, whose hearts are for self and not for Christ, but who yield themselves servants to sin.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:14-20 Warnings and judgments not having produced reformation, the sins of the nations are filled up, and they become ripe for judgments, represented by a harvest, an emblem which is used to signify the gathering of the righteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. The harvest time is when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, then the wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by a vintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them no longer. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity, probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience of God towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, though lasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sure proof of judgment at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth - That is, into that part of the earth which might be represented by a vineyard; or the earth considered as having been the abode of wicked men.<p>And cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God - See <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-6</a>. That is, the wine-press where the grapes are crushed, and where the juice, resembling blood, flows out, may be used as a symbol to denote the destruction of the wicked in the last day; and as the numbers will be immensely great, it is called the "great wine-press of divine wrath." The symbol appears to be used here alike with reference to the color of the wine resembling blood, and the pressure necessary to force it out; and thus employed it is one of the most striking emblems conceivable to denote the final destruction of the wicked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. "The vine" is what is the subject of judgment because its grapes are not what God looked for considering its careful culture, but "wild grapes" (Isa 5:1-30). The apostate world of Christendom, not the world of heathendom who have not heard of Christ, is the object of judgment. Compare the emblem, Re 19:15; Isa 63:2, 3; Joe 3:13.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Dr. More thinks the sense of this is, that men were pressed in conscience upon the sharp conviction of Christ’s powerful ministers, with sorrow for their sins, and so felt the wrath of God in them. But Mr. Mede, with whom (as to the sense of this text) I rather agree, tells us, that the treading of the vintage, in parabolical Scripture, constantly signifies a cruel, bloody, and deadly slaughter; he thinks that it is the same slaughter mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/19-19.htm" title="And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army....">Revelation 19:19-21</a></span>, as to which, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/14-15.htm" title="And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time is come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.">Revelation 14:15</a></span>, much the same metaphor is used, <span class="ital">he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath, of Almighty God.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth,....

It is doubtful whether we ought to see in this anything more than a mere slip of grammar. Possibly the word is of either gender. It is connected with the festival of Bacchus. Wordsworth, however, accounts for the masculine form of the adjective by supposing that the writer wishes to give a stronger force to the word, and to emphasize the terrible nature of the wrath of God. We have the same image in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, and it seems derived from <a href="/isaiah/58.htm">Isaiah 58</a>, and <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>. Destruction by an enemy is alluded to as the gathering of grapes in <a href="/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>.
