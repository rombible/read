The church above, making suitable reflections on the grand events which are foretold in this book, greatly serves to raise the attention of real Christians, and to teach the high concern they have in them. Thus is the church on earth instructed, animated, and encouraged, by the sentiments, temper, and devotion of the church in heaven. <span class="ital">And I heard a voice </span>— Or <span class="ital">sound, from heaven </span>— Sounding clearer and clearer; first at a distance; <span class="ital">as the sound of many waters — </span>Or <span class="ital">thunders; </span>and afterward, being nearer, it was as of <span class="ital">harpers harping on their harps </span>— It sounded vocally and instrumentally at once. <span class="ital">And they sung — </span>With voices and instruments of music; <span class="ital">as it were a new song </span>— The Christian song, which they sung before, chap. 5.; <span class="ital">and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand </span>— Those who had been the true spiritual worshippers of the one true God, through the one true Mediator, Jesus Christ; all the rest of mankind offering up their devotions to other objects, and through other mediators; or not worshipping with a truly spiritual worship; <span class="ital">which were redeemed from the earth — </span>From this present evil world, being bought by the blood of Christ, and delivered from the guilt and power of sin by the word and Spirit of God. <span class="ital">These are they which were not </span>— Or, <span class="ital">had not been, defiled with women </span>— It seems that one kind of defilement, and the most alluring temptation, is put for every other. Or rather, the meaning is, that they had kept themselves pure from the stains and pollutions of spiritual whoredom, or idolatry, with which the other parts of the world were miserably debauched and corrupted. <span class="ital">These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth </span>— Who are nearest to him; or rather, the meaning is, who followed the Lamb in all things while on earth; who adhered constantly to the religion of Christ, in all conditions and in all places, whether in adversity or prosperity; whether in conventicles and deserts, or in churches and cities. <span class="ital">These were redeemed from among men </span>— Rescued from the corruptions prevalent among mankind, and consecrated as <span class="ital">the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb </span>— An earnest and assurance of a more plentiful harvest in succeeding times. <span class="ital">And in their mouth was found no guile </span>— They were as free from hypocrisy as from idolatry; <span class="ital">for they were without fault before the throne of God </span>— They resembled their blessed Redeemer, who <span class="ital">did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth, </span>(<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm" title="Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:">1 Peter 2:22</a>,) and were, as the apostle requires Christians to be, <span class="ital">blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke,</span> &c., <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Php 2:15</a>. But possibly it may be asked, Where did such a church ever exist, especially before the Reformation? To which it may be replied, That it hath existed, and not only in idea, history demonstrates; as it hath been before evinced that there hath been, in every age, some true worshippers of God, and faithful servants of Jesus Christ; and as Elijah did not know the seven thousand who had never bowed the knee to Baal, so there may have been more true Christians than were always visible.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-5 Mount Sion is the gospel church. Christ is with his church, and in the midst of her in all her troubles, therefore she is not consumed. His presence secures perseverance. His people appear honourably. They have the name of God written in their foreheads; they make a bold and open profession of their faith in God and Christ, and this is followed by suitable actings. There were persons in the darkest times, who ventured and laid down their lives for the worship and truth of the gospel of Christ. They kept themselves clean from the wicked abominations of the followers of antichrist. Their hearts were right with God; and they were freely pardoned in Christ; he is glorified in them, and they in him. May it be our prayer, our endeavour, our ambition, to be found in this honourable company. Those who are really sanctified and justified are meant here, for no hypocrite, however plausible, can be accounted to be without fault before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I looked - My attention was drawn to a new vision.

The Lamb Seen on Zion with the 144,000. Their Song. The Gospel Proclaimed before the End by One Angel: The Fall of Babylon, by Another: The Doom of the Beast Worshippers, by a Third. The Blessedness of the Dead in the Lord. The Harvest. The Vintage.<p>In contrast to the beast, false prophet, and apostate Church (Re 13:1-18) and introductory to the announcement of judgments about to descend on them and the world (Re 14:8-11, anticipatory of Re 18:2-6), stand here the redeemed, "the divine kernel of humanity, the positive fruits of the history of the world and the Church" [Auberlen]. The fourteenth through sixteenth chapters describe the preparations for the Messianic judgment. As the fourteenth chapter begins with the 144,000 of Israel (compare Re 7:4-8, no longer exposed to trial as then, but now triumphant), so the fifteenth chapter begins with those who have overcome from among the Gentiles (compare Re 15:1-5 with Re 7:9-17); the two classes of elect forming together the whole company of transfigured saints who shall reign with Christ.<p>1. a&#8212;A, B, C, Coptic, and Origen read, "the."<p>Lamb &#8230; on &#8230; Sion&#8212;having left His position "in the midst of the throne," and now taking His stand on Sion.<p>his Father's name&#8212;A, B, and C read, "His name and His Father's name."<p>in&#8212;Greek, "upon." God's and Christ's name here answers to the seal "upon their foreheads" in Re 7:3. As the 144,000 of Israel are "the first-fruits" (Re 14:4), so "the harvest" (Re 14:15) is the general assembly of Gentile saints to be translated by Christ as His first act in assuming His kingdom, prior to His judgment (Re 16:17-21, the last seven vials) on the Antichristian world, in executing which His saints shall share. As Noah and Lot were taken seasonably out of the judgment, but exposed to the trial to the last moment [De Burgh], so those who shall reign with Christ shall first suffer with Him, being delivered out of the judgments, but not out of the trials. The Jews are meant by "the saints of the Most High": against them Antichrist makes war, changing their times and laws; for true Israelites cannot join in the idolatry of the beast, any more than true Christians. The common affliction will draw closely together, in opposing the beast's worship, the Old Testament and New Testament people of God. Thus the way is paved for Israel's conversion. This last utter scattering of the holy people's power leads them, under the Spirit, to seek Messiah, and to cry at His approach, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord."<span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads....">Revelation 14:1-5</a></span> The Lamb with his company standing on Mount Sion,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/14-6.htm" title="And I saw another angel fly in the middle of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,">Revelation 14:6</a>,7</span> an angel preacheth the gospel,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a></span> another proclaimeth the fall of Babylon,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/14-9.htm" title="And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,...">Revelation 14:9-12</a></span> and a third, the punishment of them that worship the beast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a></span> The blessedness of those that die in the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle....">Revelation 14:14-16</a></span> The harvest of the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/14-17.htm" title="And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle....">Revelation 14:17-20</a></span> The vintage and winepress of God’s wrath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God, in this part of the vision, showeth his servant John, that during the whole reign of antichrist, till the voice mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Babylon is fallen, </span> should be heard, notwithstanding all his rage, he would preserve his church, though it would be but a small number, bearing no better proportion to the whole world than one hundred and forty-four thousand (the number of those sealed of each tribe of Israel, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree....">Revelation 7:1-17</a></span>) bare to whole Israel, which were above six hundred thousand upon both their numberings, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/1-26.htm" title="Of the children of Judah, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;">Numbers 1:26</a></span>.

To the description of the Lamb, are propounded three things: his situation, place and attendance: for the rest are expounded in the former visions, especially in the fifth chapter.<p>(2) Prepared to do his office see Ac 7:56, in the midst of the church, which mount Zion pictured before.<p>(3) This retinue of the Lamb is described first by divine mark<p>(as before in) Re 7:2 in this verse. Then by divine occupation, in that every one in his retinue most earnestly and sweetly Re 14:2 glorify the Lamb with a special song before God and his elect angels. Flesh and blood cannot hear this song, nor understand, Re 14:3. Lastly by their deeds done before, and their sanctification in that they were virgins, pure from spiritual and bodily fornication, that is, from impiety and unrighteousness. They followed the Lamb as a guide to all goodness, cleaved to him and are holy to him, as by grace redeemed by him. In truth and simplicity of Christ they have exercised all these things, sanctimony of life, the guidance of the Lamb, a thankful remembrance of redemption by him and finally (to conclude in a word) they are blameless before the Lord, Re 14:4,5.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰδον</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἰδού</span>.

Since the Lamb appears as the leader of the glorified,[3422] not only does the contrast between Christ and Satan, with his dragon-form, stand forth in startling relief; but the form of the Lamb also reminds us that the Lord himself has by his sufferings and death attained the victory,[3423] therefore his people must follow him; and that the redemption of believers (<a href="/revelation/14-4.htm" title="These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.

The failure to acknowledge the proper significance of the entire vision is connected no less with the arbitrary presumption that Mount Zion is to be regarded in heaven,[3427] than with the allegorizing interpretation, according to which Mount Zion is regarded as the Christian Church.[3428] Vitringa unites the reference of the whole to the true Church,[3429] with the correct acknowledgment[3430] that the locality represented in the vision is meant properly. Cf. similar local designations within the vision, which are to be understood with absolute literalness, <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm" title="And I saw another angel fly in the middle of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,">Revelation 14:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.">Revelation 13:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm" title="And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars:">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>. The holy place named, the home of the O. T.—and, therefore, also of the N. T.[3431]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Church, is adapted like no other place for that which is displayed to the gazing John. With the Lamb there appear one hundred and forty-four thousand who have the name of the Lamb, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. These one hundred and forty-four thousand are, according to the usual conception,[3432] identical with those mentioned in ch. <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>. The number is the same; the seal there mentioned on the foreheads may be combined with the names of God which the followers of the Lamb have written on their foreheads; also the place, Mount Zion, appears to apply especially to glorified believers from Israel. But there are weighty reasons for the distinction of the one hundred and forty-four thousand in our text from those named in <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>.[3433] [See, for the contrary, Note LIII., p 256, on ch. <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>.] 1. If John had wished here to designate those already mentioned in <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>, he would have expressed this definitely by the article.

This was the more necessary, because here a particular description of the one hundred and forty-four <span class="greekheb">χιλιάδες</span> follows (ε͂<span class="greekheb">χουσαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), which could lead to an identity with the sealed only in case it be conceived that the seal had as an inscription the twofold names here designated; a conception which in itself has no difficulty, but is remote therefrom, because the sign of the seal has a designation and significance <span class="ital">different</span> from this sign of the name: there the fidelity, not to be affected by the impending trouble, is sealed, while here the name of God expresses the eternal and blessed belonging of believers to their heavenly Lord,[3434] in contrast with those who have made themselves bondsmen of the beast. (<a href="/revelation/14-9.htm" title="And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,">Revelation 14:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-11.htm" title="And the smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.">Revelation 14:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm" title="And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:">Revelation 13:16</a> sq.) 2.

But it is rather to be said that in this passage only the schematic <span class="ital">number</span>, which as a designation of a mass suits mainly believers out of Israel (cf. <a href="/context/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel....">Revelation 7:4-8</a>), is transferred to such as have completed their course, and designates not only the definite description, <a href="/revelation/14-3.htm" title="And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.">Revelation 14:3</a> sqq., but especially also the antithesis lying in the entire context to the heathen worshippers of the beast, as those <span class="ital">springing from the heathen</span>.[3436] This select band (cf. <a href="/revelation/14-4.htm" title="These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.

I reply: If a name, which <span class="ital">is being burnt in</span>, can be expressed by <span class="greekheb">καιόμενον</span>, that <span class="ital">which has been burnt in</span> cannot thus be expressed. It is a matter of little consequence: it is admitted to be a gloss on both sides; the only question is as to its origin. My own view serves towards vindicating the reading respecting <span class="ital">the name of the Lamb</span>. Some one, relying on the reading of Erasmus, which does not contain <span class="ital">the name of the Lamb</span>, ventured to hope that the name of <span class="ital">the Father</span>, and not that of <span class="ital">the Lamb</span>, would hereafter come into favour. That enemy of the Nicene faith, and of the glory of Christ, was deceived. Nay, indeed both <span class="ital">the name of the Lamb and the name of His Father</span> are written on the foreheads of the CXLIV. thousands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[152] 1 These words (<span class="ital">His name and</span>) are omitted by Rec.

Having described (<a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. and 13.) the trinity of enemies with which Christ and his people contend, the vision now passes on to depict the blessedness in store for the faithful Christian, and, on the other hand, the final fate of the dragon and his adherents. We are thus once more led to the final judgment. And just as in the former vision, after the assurance of the salvation of the faithful (<a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>.), came the denunciation of woe for the ungodly (<a href="/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8-11:14</a>), leading once more to a picture of the saved (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15-19</a>), so here we have the assured blessedness of the faithful portrayed (<a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-13</a>), followed by the judgments upon the ungodly (<a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14 - 18:24</a>), and leading on once more to a picture of the saints in glory (<a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Zion;</span> <span class="accented">and behold, the Lamb standing on the Mount Zion</span>, as in the Revised Version.

Note the similarity to the description in <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. Here, as there, the hundred and forty-four thousand are those "redeemed from the earth" (ver. 3). The number denotes a large and perfect number; a multitude of which the total is complete (see on Revelation 7:4). In <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. the sealing in the forehead is described.

The scene is laid in a landscape. The background is formed by a Flemish city, probably intended to represent Jerusalem, and by churches and monasteries in the early Netherland style. The middle ground is occupied by trees, meadows, and green slopes. In the very center of the picture a square altar is hung with red damask and covered with a white cloth. Here stands a lamb, from whose breast a stream of blood issues into a crystal glass. Angels kneel round the altar with parti-colored wings and variegated dresses, many of them praying with joined hands, others holding aloft the emblems of the passion, two in front waving censers. From the right, behind the altar, issues a numerous band of female saints, all in rich and varied costumes, fair hair floating over their shoulders, and palms in their hands. Foremost may be noticed Sta. Barbara and Sta. Agnes. From the left advance popes, cardinals, bishops, monks, and minor clergy, with crosiers, crosses, and palms. In the center, near the base, a small octagonal fountain of stone projects a stream into a clear rill. Two groups are in adoration on each side of the fountain, - on the right, the twelve apostles kneeling barefoot, and an array of popes, cardinals, and bishops, with a miscellaneous crowd of church-people; on the left, kings and princes in various costumes. They are surrounded by a wilderness of flowering shrubs, lilies, and other plants. On the wings of the picture numerous worshippers move toward the place of worship, - crusaders, knights, kings, and princes, including the figures of the two artists on horseback. "Here, approaching from all sides, are seen that 'great multitude of all nations and hundreds and people and tongues' - the holy warriors and the holy pilgrims, coming in solemn processions from afar - with other throngs already arrived in the celestial plain, clothed in white robes, and holding palms in their hands. Their forms are like unto ours; the landscape around them is a mere transcript of the sweet face of our outer nature; the graceful wrought-iron fountain in the midst is such an one as still sends forth its streams in an ancient Flemish city; yet we feel these creatures to be beings from whose eyes God has wiped away all tears - who will hunger and thirst no more; our imagination invests these flowery meads with the peace and radiance of celestial precincts, while the streams of the fountain are converted into living waters, to which the Lamb Himself will lead His redeemed. Here, in short, where all is human and natural in form, the spiritual depths of our nature are stirred" (Mrs. Jameson, "History of Our Lord," ii., 339). </body></html>
