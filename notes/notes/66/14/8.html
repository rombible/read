Better, <span class= "ital">And another, a second, angel followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, who has given all the nations to drink of, </span>&c. The second angel follows on the first: the doom of the world-city, the metropolis of the empire of the world-power, follows the proclamation of the gospel. The principles of Christ’s gospel must undermine the world-power; the fall of some Babylon principle has almost always succeeded the age of spiritual revival. Pagan Rome goes down before the gospel. Civil freedom follows the wake of religious freedom, for Babylon belongs not to one age. Pagan Rome was Babylon to St. John; papal Rome was often Babylon to a later age. Dante, Savanarola, Tauler, Luther, felt her to be so in the days when their eyes were enlightened; but Babylon was not on the Euphrates alone: she has reared palaces on the Seine, and on the Thames, Tiber, and on the Bosphorus. She may yet erect her power in more imposing form; but faith in that gospel which is the power of God, will cast her down along with everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God. The influence of Babylon is declared in this: that she has given all nations to drink of deadly wine—the wine alike of her sin and of her doom, of her fornication and of the wrath which will overtake it. Babylon, then, is clearly an emblem of some principles which have been more or less accepted by all nations, and which will more or less involve all in the consequences of her fall. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-17.htm" title="And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.">Revelation 16:17</a>, where the features of this Babylon are more fully developed.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And there followed another angel </span>— As the admonitions of the first angel had not the proper effect upon the kingdom of the beast, a second angel is commissioned to proclaim the fall of the capital city, <span class="ital">saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city </span>— By <span class="ital">Babylon </span>is meant Rome, including the antichristian kingdom, the papal hierarchy seated there. Rome, considered in this light, is called Babylon, upon many accounts. Babylon was magnificent, strong, proud, powerful. So was Rome also. Babylon was first, Rome afterward, the residence of the emperors of a great part of the world. What Babylon was to Israel of old, Rome hath been both to the literal and spiritual Israel of God. Hence the liberty of the ancient Jews was connected with the overthrow of the Babylonish empire. And when Rome is finally overthrown, then the people of God will be at liberty. Whenever Babylon is mentioned in this book, <span class="ital">the great </span>is added, to teach us that Rome then commenced Babylon when it commenced <span class="ital">the great city; </span>when it swallowed up the Grecian monarchy and its fragments, Syria in particular; and, in consequence of this, obtained dominion over Jerusalem, about sixty years before the birth of Christ. Then it began, but it will not cease to be Babylon, till it is finally destroyed. Its spiritual greatness began in the fifth century, and increased from age to age. It seems it will come to its utmost height just before its final overthrow. <span class="ital">Her fornication </span>is her idolatry, invocation of saints and angels, worship of images, human traditions, with all that outward pomp, yea, and that fierce and bloody zeal, wherewith she pretends to serve God. But with spiritual fornication, as elsewhere, so in Rome, fleshly fornication is joined abundantly. Witness the stews there, licensed by the pope, which are no inconsiderable branch of his revenue. This is fitly compared to wine, because of its intoxicating nature. Of this <span class="ital">wine she hath, </span>indeed, <span class="ital">made all nations drink </span>— More especially by her later missions. We may observe, this <span class="ital">making them drink </span>is not ascribed to the beast, but to Babylon. For Rome itself, the Roman <span class="ital">inquisitions, congregations, </span>and <span class="ital">Jesuits, </span>continually propagate their idolatrous doctrines and practices, with or without the consent of this or that pope, who himself is not secure from their censure. But, as Bishop Newton observes, though Rome, with the antichristian power above described, was evidently here intended, it would not have been prudent to predict and denounce its destruction in open and direct terms; it was for many wise reasons done thus covertly under the name of Babylon, the great idolatress of the earth, and enemy of the people of God in former times. By the same figure of speech that the first angel cried, that <span class="ital">the hour of his judgment is come, </span>this second angel proclaims that <span class="ital">Babylon is fallen; </span>the sentence is as certain as if it was already executed. For greater certainty too it is repeated twice, <span class="ital">Babylon is fallen, is fallen; </span>as Joseph said, <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm" title="And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.">Genesis 41:32</a>, <span class="ital">that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, because the thing was established by God. </span>The reason then is added of this sentence against Babylon; <span class="ital">because she made all nations drink of the wine of her wrath, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">of the inflaming wine, of her fornication </span>— Hers was a kind of Circean cup with poisoned liquor, to intoxicate and inflame mankind to spiritual fornication. St. John, in these figures, copies the ancient prophets. In the same manner, and in the same words, did Isaiah foretel the fate of ancient Babylon, (<a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm" title="And, behold, here comes a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken to the ground.">Isaiah 21:9</a>,) <span class="ital">Babylon is fallen, is fallen; </span>and Jeremiah hath assigned much the same reason for her destruction, (<a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm" title="Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.">Jeremiah 51:7</a>,) <span class="ital">Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord’s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. </span>As by the first angel calling upon men to worship God, we understand the opposers of the worship of images in the eighth and ninth centuries, so by this second angel proclaiming the fall of mystic Babylon or Rome we understand particularly Peter Valdo, and those who concurred with him among the Waldenses and Albigenses; who were the first heralds, as I may say, of this proclamation, as they first of all, in the twelfth century, pronounced the Church of Rome to be the apocalyptic <span class="ital">Babylon, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth; </span>and for this cause not only departed from her communion themselves, but engaged great numbers also to follow their example, and laid the first foundation of the Reformation. Rome then began to fall; and as the ruin of Babylon was completed by degrees, so likewise will that of Rome; and these holy confessors and martyrs first paved the way to it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:6-13 The progress of the Reformation appears to be here set forth. The four proclamations are plain in their meaning; that all Christians may be encouraged, in the time of trial, to be faithful to their Lord. The gospel is the great means whereby men are brought to fear God, and to give glory to him. The preaching of the everlasting gospel shakes the foundations of antichrist in the world, and hastens its downfal. If any persist in being subject to the beast, and in promoting his cause, they must expect to be for ever miserable in soul and body. The believer is to venture or suffer any thing in obeying the commandments of God, and professing the faith of Jesus. May God bestow this patience upon us. Observe the description of those that are and shall be blessed: such as die in the Lord; die in the cause of Christ, in a state of union with Christ; such as are found in Christ when death comes. They rest from all sin, temptation, sorrow, and persecution; for there the wicked cease from troubling, there the weary are at rest. Their works follow them: do not go before as their title, or purchase, but follow them as proofs of their having lived and died in the Lord: the remembrance of them will be pleasant, and the reward far above all their services and sufferings. This is made sure by the testimony of the Spirit, witnessing with their spirits, and the written word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there followed another angel - That is, in the vision. It is not necessary to suppose that this would, in the fulfillment, succeed the other in time. The chapter is made up of a number of representations, all designed to illustrate the same general thing, and to produce the same general effect on the mind - that the gospel would be finally triumphant, and that, therefore, the hearts of the troubled and the afflicted should be comforted. The representation in this verse, bearing on this point, is, that Babylon, the great enemy, would fall to rise no more.<p>Babylon - This is the first time that the word "Babylon" occurs in this book, though it is repeatedly mentioned afterward, <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10</a>, <a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>. In reference to the literal Babylon, the word is used, in the New Testament, in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-11.htm">Matthew 1:11-13</a>; <a href="/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>. See Intro. to 1 Peter, section 2. Babylon was a well-known city on the Euphrates (for a full description of which see the notes on Isaiah, analysis of chapters 13 and 14), and was, in the days of its pride and glory, the head of the pagan world. In reference to the meaning of the word in this place, it may be remarked:<p>(1) That the general characteristics of Babylon were, that it was proud, haughty, insolent, oppressive. It was chiefly known and remembered by the Hebrew people as a power that had invaded the Holy Land; that had reduced its capital and temple to ruins; that had destroyed the independence of their country, subjecting it to the condition of a province, and that had carried away the inhabitants into a long and painful captivity. It became, therefore, the emblem of all that was haughty and oppressive, and especially of all that persecuted the church of God.<p>(2) the word must be used here to denote some power that resembled the ancient and literal Babylon in these characteristics. The literal Babylon was no more; but the name might be properly used to denote a similar power. We are to seek, therefore, in the application of this, for some power that had the same general characteristics which the literal Babylon had.<p>(3) in inquiring, then, what is referred to here by the word "Babylon," we may remark:<p>(a) that it could not be the literal Babylon on the Euphrates, for the whole representation here is of something future, and the literal Babylon had long since disappeared, never, according to the prophecies, to be rebuilt. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20-22</a>.<p>(b) All the circumstances require us to understand this of Rome, at some period of its history: for Rome, like Babylon, was the seat of empire, and the head of the pagan world; Rome was characterized by many of the same attributes as Babylon, being arrogant, proud, oppressive; Rome, like Babylon, was distinguished for its conquests, and for the fact that it made all other nations subject to its control; Rome had been, like Babylon, a desolating power, having destroyed the capital of the Holy Land, and burnt its beautiful temple, and reduced the country to a province. Rome, like Babylon of old, was the most formidable power with which the church had to contend. Yet.<p>(c) it is not, I suppose, Rome considered as pagan that is here meant, but Rome considered as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Alike in this book and in Daniel, Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power, standing in direct opposition to the gospel of Christ, resisting its progress in the world, and preventing its final prevalence. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. When that falls, the last enemy of the church will be destroyed, and the final triumph of the true religion will be speedy and complete. See <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-26.htm">Daniel 7:26-27</a>.<p>(d) So it was understood among the early Christians. Mr. Gibbon, speaking of the expectations of the early Christians about the end of the world, and the glory of the literal reign of the Messiah, says, "While the happiness and glory of a temporal reign were promised to the disciples of Christ, the most dreadful calamities were denounced against an unbelieving world. The edification of the New Jerusalem was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of the mystic Babylon; and as long as the emperors who reigned before Constantine persisted in the profession of idolatry, the epithet of Babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of Rome," vol. i. p. 263.<p>Is fallen - That is, an event appeared in vision as if a mighty city fell to rise no more.<p>Is fallen - This is repeated to give emphasis to the declaration, and to express the joyousness of that event.<p>That great city - Babylon in its glory was the largest city of the world. Rome, in its turn, also became the largest; and the expression used here denotes that the power here referred to would be properly represented by cities of their magnitude.<p>Because she made all nations drink of the wine - This language is probably taken from <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>; "Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of the wine, therefore the nations are mad." Babylon here, in accordance with the usual custom of the sacred writers when speaking of cities (see the notes on <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>), is represented as a female - here a female of abandoned character, holding in her hand a cup of wine to attract her lovers; that is, she allures and intoxicates them. This is a beautiful image to denote the influence of a great and corrupt city, and especially a city corrupt in its religion and devoted to idolatry and superstition, and may well be applied either to Babylon or Rome, literal or mystical.<p>Of the wrath - There seems an incongruity in the use of this word here, and Prof. Stuart proposes to render it "the inflammatory wine of her fornication"; that is, inebriating wine - wine that excited the passions and that led to uncleanness. He supposes that the word here used - &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  thumos - means "heat, inflammation," corresponding to the Hebrew &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;  che&#772;maah There are no instances, however, in the New Testament in which the word is used in this sense. The common and proper meaning is mind, soul, then mind agitated with passion or under the influence of desire - a violent commotion of mind, as wrath, anger, indignation (Robinson, Lexicon). The ground of the representation here seems to be that Yahweh is often described as giving to the nations in his wrath an intoxicating cup so that they should reel and stagger to their destruction. Compare <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>. The meaning here is, that the nations had drunk of that cup which brought on the wrath of God on account of her "fornication." Babylon is represented as a harlot, with a cup of wine in her hand, and the effect of drinking that cup was to expose them to the wrath of God, hence, called "the wine of the wrath of her fornication" - the alluring cup that was followed by wrath on account of her fornication.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. another&#8212;So Vulgate.

Others have thought that Luther, and the reformers of his times, are intended, who gave a deadly blow to Babylon, and she has been falling ever since: but to me it appears, that a set of ministers in the spiritual reign of Christ are meant, who will not only signify the fall of Babylon to be certain, and near at hand, but will live to see and declare her actual fall, as follows: <p>saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city; which is to be understood not of the world in general, which will not now be come to an end, for all nations of the world are distinguished from this Babylon in the next clause, and is only represented as a city, though a great one; nor of Babylon in Chaldea, which was fallen many hundreds of years before this vision; nor is there any likelihood of its being restored, nor any reason to believe that it will ever more be the seat of empire over all the nations and kings of the earth, as the Babylon mentioned in this book is, <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a> though undoubtedly the allusion is to that Babylon, and the very words are used which express the fall of it, and are taken from it; see <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a> but this is to be understood of Rome, which all along in this book is called the great city; see <a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a> and not of Rome Pagan, for that is fallen already; and the account of the fall of that is given before, at the opening of the sixth seal, and the casting the dragon out of heaven, upon the war there, between Michael and him, though Mr. Daubuz is of opinion that this is here meant; but of Rome Papal, called Babylon the great, <a href="/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a> and so the Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac and Arabic versions, read here; and the Romish antichrist is so called, because that city was famous for its pride and haughtiness, for its tyranny and cruelty, and for its idolatry; and indeed its name, which signifies "confusion", well agrees with the Papacy, which is a confused mixture of Judaism, Paganism, and Christianity: so Rome is called Babel in some ancient writings of the Jews (o), where some copies read "Babel", others read "Rome"; and Tertullian, who wrote long before the appearance of the Romish antichrist, says (p), with our John, Babylon is a figure of the Roman city: and of this it is said, that it "is fallen, is fallen"; which words are repeated for the certain confirmation of it, as matter of fact; for the fall of antichrist will certainly be in the spiritual reign of Christ, in the Philadelphian church state; See Gill on <a href="/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a> now will Babylon come in remembrance before God, and he will pour out the vials of his wrath upon her, and will give men an aversion to her; and through the preaching of the Gospel she will fall, just as the walls of Jericho fell at the sounding of the rams' horns: the reason of which fall will be, <p>because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication: by her "fornication" is meant the idolatry of the church of Rome; so the idolatry of Israel and Judah is often expressed in the Old Testament by fornication and whoredoms; see <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a> and the wine of it designs the alluring methods used to draw into it; such as the riches and honours, and pleasures of this world, promised to men, and the great appearances of holiness and religion, the deceivableness of unrighteousness, the miracles, signs, and lying wonders done by them, by which men are made sottish and stupid, and induced to believe a lie; just as wine intoxicates, and inclines and excites to lust: and by "the wrath" of it is meant either the heat of lust unto it, or the wrath of God against them which is stirred up by it; and now the aggravation of her sin is, that she not only drinks of this wine herself, or commits idolatry, being instigated to it by the allurements of it, though she hereby incurs the displeasure and wrath of God, but she draws all nations into the same idolatrous practices. <p>(o) Zohar in Numb. fol. 103. 4. &amp; Raya Mchimna, apud ib. in Exod. fol. 49. 3.((p) Adv.

It is a characteristic of the dramatic vividness of the scene, that every new point, which is to be proclaimed, is committed to a special angel.[3487] The angel now coming forward is distinguished by the compound formula <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΛΛΟς ΔΕΎΤΕΡΟς</span></span></span> from the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΛΛΟς ἌΓΓ</span></span></span>. mentioned in <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm" title="And I saw another angel fly in the middle of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,">Revelation 14:6</a>.[3488]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΠΕΣΕΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἜΠΕΣΕΝ ΒΑΒΥΛΏΝ Ἡ ΜΕΓΆΛΗ</span></span></span>. The cry,[3489] in a prophetical way, represents the sure and near impending judgment as already fulfilled.[3490] The name of the O. T. secular power is transferred to that of the N. T.,[3491] i.e., to Rome,[3492] by not only indicating by means of this name its ungodly nature,[3493] but also by the adjective <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΜΕΓΆΛΗ</span></span></span>, especially emphasizing how extent and fulness of power[3494] are powerless for the protection of the vain foundation of self-assertion[3495] from complete overthrow.[3496]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἣ ἘΚ ΤΟῦ ΟἽΝΟΥ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> As in the ancient prophets, alongside of the threatenings of punishment, the precise charges on which those threats rest are generally presented, so also here the guilt of great Babylon is established. The view portrayed in <a href="/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm" title="And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:">Revelation 17:4</a>, <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm" title="For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.">Revelation 18:3</a>, lies here already at the foundation. Babylon-Rome appears as a harlot who has seduced all the dwellers on earth to commit fornication with her: “<span class="ital">She made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication</span>.” The expression in <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm" title="For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.">Revelation 18:3</a> is incorrectly explained, if the <span class="greekheb">θυμοῦ</span> be regarded otherwise than in the firmly established sense of “<span class="ital">wrath</span>,” <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm" title="The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:">Revelation 14:10</a>.[3497] According to the linguistic usage of the Apoc., it is the glow and rage of <span class="ital">wrath</span>,[3498] and not any other passion, which is designated by <span class="greekheb">θυμός</span>. But it is impossible to seek this wrath in the harlot Babylon herself, and then to understand the <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> of cunning arts, dissembling love, with which wrathful Babylon destroys the nations.[3499] With perfect correctness, De Wette says that the entire expression depends upon a combination of two ideas: the wine of fornication,[3500] wherewith Babylon has intoxicated the nations, is at the same time characterized as a <span class="greekheb">οἰνος τοῦ θυμοῦ</span> (viz., of the Divine wrath), and it is, consequently, represented[3501] how the wine offered by the harlot Babylon to the nations, with which she has intoxicated them and led them to fornication with her, is also a wine which, because of the Divine wrath, has caused that drunkenness in the nations. It is analogous to what is instructively said in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>. The <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> is the idolatry practised with great Babylon, the all-ruling secular power.[3502]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3487] “Quot res nunciandæ, totidem nuncii” (Grot.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3488] Cf. examples in Wetst.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3489] <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm" title="And, behold, here comes a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen.

Because in those passages, where <span class="ital">the wrath of God</span> is treated of, <span class="greekheb">ὁ οἶνος τοῦ θυμοῦ</span> is usually said; for that reason here, and in ch. <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm" title="For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.">Revelation 18:3</a>, where the fornication of Babylon is treated of, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΟἾΝΟς ΤΟῦ ΘΥΜΟῦ</span></span></span> has also been inserted by the copyists.[160] But see App. Crit. Ed. ii. on this passage. Under the figure of a draught is often described <span class="ital">the anger of God</span>, and often <span class="ital">the impurity of</span> [spiritual] <span class="ital">whoredom</span>. It is in the former draught, and not the latter, that the word <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θυμοῦ</span> is used.—<span class="greekheb">πεπότικε</span>, <span class="ital">hath made to drink</span>) Luther says in the preface to Robert Barns’ Lives of the Pontiffs, “I indeed at first, who am not greatly versed or skilled in histories, attacked the Papacy, <span class="ital">a priori</span>, as the saying is, that is, from the Sacred Scriptures. Now I wonderfully rejoice, that others do the same <span class="ital">a posteriori</span>, that is, from histories. And I seem to myself altogether to triumph, when, as the light appears, I understand that histories are in agreement with the Scriptures.” And thus the history of the affairs of Rome, which is more and more brought forward into the light, serves to confirm the preaching of this second angel. But, laying aside party zeal, it is right that we should here especially weigh the things which were carried on in the East at the beginning of this century, by missions sent from <span class="ital">Rome</span>, rather than the Pontiff; and, on the other hand, the things which began to be carried on by evangelical missions. The impure draught given <span class="ital">to the nations</span> is followed by a purer draught.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[159] ABC<span class="ital">h</span> Vulg. reject <span class="greekheb">ἡ πόλις</span>, which Rec.

Each new scene is unfolded by its own special messenger. Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; <span class="accented">fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which made</span>, etc. The second "is fallen" is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, etc., but is inserted in A, P, some cursives, versions, and Fathers. Omit "city." <span class="accented">Babylon</span> is the type of the world power. Like so much of the Apocalypse, the image is supplied by the Book of Daniel. There the kingdom is spoken of as <span class="accented">great</span> (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>; cf. also <a href="/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>.). In its oppression of the Jewish nation, Babylon is a type of the world power which persecutes the Church of God. At the time when St. John wrote, this power was preeminently possessed and wielded by Rome, and that empire may thus be intended as the immediate antitype of Babylon. But the description is also applicable to the persecuting power of the world in all ages, and its denial of and opposition to God. Babylon is representative of the world, as Jerusalem is of the true Church of God. Alford observes, "Two things are mingled: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wine of her fornication, of which all nations have drunk (<a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wine of the wrath of God, which he shall give her to drink (ver. 10 and <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>). The latter is the retribution for the former; the former turns into the latter; they are treated as one and the same." The description seems taken from <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7, 8</a>, "Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed."
