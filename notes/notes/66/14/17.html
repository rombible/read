<span class="ital">he also having a sharp sickle </span>— To assist in this execution, and finish the destruction of the enemies of the truth. <span class="ital">And another angel, </span>just at that instant, <span class="ital">came out from the altar </span>— Of burnt-offering, from whence the martyrs had cried for vengeance. <span class="ital">Which </span>angel, it is said, <span class="ital">had power over fire </span>— This, according to Daubuz, is spoken in allusion to the office of that priest who was appointed by lot in the temple-service to take care of the fire upon the altar, and who was therefore called the priest over the fire. Grotius interprets it, habens ministerium iræ divinæ, <span class="ital">having the office of God’s vengeance. And he cried with a loud voice </span>— With great vehemence; <span class="ital">to him that had the sharp sickle </span>— Being sent to bring a message to him; <span class="ital">saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters, </span>&c. — Begin to put in execution the righteous judgments of God on this wicked generation; <span class="ital">for her grapes are fully ripe </span>— The time of God’s vengeance, his appointed time, is fully come, for the iniquities of the inhabitants of the earth have made them fully ripe for destruction. <span class="ital">And the angel thrust in his sickle </span>— Immediately upon this order the angel began to cut down those wicked persons whose iniquities had made them ripe for destruction; <span class="ital">and gathered </span>— Or lopped off the grapes of <span class="ital">the vine of the earth, and cast </span>them <span class="ital">into the great wine- press of the wrath of God </span>— Which seemed to stand ready to receive them; that is, delivered them over to divine vengeance, which should press them hard with grievous afflictions, as grapes are pressed in a wine-press. <span class="ital">And the wine-press was trodden without the city </span>— The images in this vision are very strong and expressive. The largest wine-presses used to be in some places out of the city. This expression, therefore, seems to intimate the great numbers that should be involved in this general destruction. <span class="ital">And</span> <span class="ital">the blood came out of the wine-press even unto the horses-bridles, </span>&c. — Which is a strong hyperbolical expression, to signify a vast slaughter and effusion of blood; a way of speaking not unknown to the Jews, for the Jerusalem Talmud, describing the woful slaughter which the Roman Emperor Adrian made of the Jews at the destruction of the city of Bitter, saith, that “the horses waded in blood up to the nostrils.” Nor are similar examples wanting even in classic authors; for Silius Italicus, speaking of Hannibal’s descent into Italy, useth a like expression of “the bridles flowing with much blood.” The stage where this bloody tragedy is acted is <span class="ital">without the city, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs, </span>which, as Mr. Mede ingeniously observes, is the measure of <span class="ital">stato dello chiesa, </span>or the state of the Roman Church, or St. Peter’s patrimony, which, reaching from the walls of Rome unto the river Po and the marshes of Verona, contains the space of two hundred Italian miles, which make exactly sixteen hundred furlongs. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:14-20 Warnings and judgments not having produced reformation, the sins of the nations are filled up, and they become ripe for judgments, represented by a harvest, an emblem which is used to signify the gathering of the righteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. The harvest time is when the corn is ripe; when the believers are ripe for heaven, then the wheat of the earth shall be gathered into Christ's garner. And by a vintage. The enemies of Christ and his church are not destroyed, till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he will spare them no longer. The wine-press is the wrath of God, some terrible calamity, probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. The patience of God towards sinners, is the greatest miracle in the world; but, though lasting, it will not be everlasting; and ripeness in sin is a sure proof of judgment at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And another angel - The fifth in order.

It is a strange conceit of Mr. Brightman's, that this angel is Thomas Lord Cromwell, in the days of King Henry the Eighth, a sincere favourer of pure religion; and that the following angel is Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, a martyr, that had power over fire; and that the vintage, here spoken of, refers to the destroying of religious houses, and disposing of abbey lands to other uses; which was done under the king's authority, by the former of these, at the instigation of the latter, when those who were set over that business made such havoc of the goods of the Papists, that their houses seemed to swim in their spoils, as in a river of pressed grapes. Dr. Goodwin much better interprets it of God's vengeance upon the carnal Protestants and professors of religion; since it is an angel out of the temple that will execute it, and another from the altar, zealous of God's worship, that will provoke to it; and since the winepress will be trodden without the city, the church; and which began in the wars in Germany, in the last age, and will have its full accomplishment when the whole outward court is given to the Gentiles; but how these, who are but a few, when compared with the wicked of the world, should be called the vine of the earth, I see not. Mr. Daubuz thinks this vision of the vintage has had, at least in part, its fulfilment in the late wars in the times of Queen Anne, the Popish countries being then made the seat of war, in which they suffered much; rather they come nearest to the truth of the matter, who take this to be the battle of the great God Almighty, under the sixth vial, <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a> fought by the word of God, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who will tread the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God, <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a> when the beast and false prophet will both be destroyed: but inasmuch as Babylon is before declared to be fallen, <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a> and since the gathering in of the Lord's wheat at the first resurrection is designed by the harvest, it is best to understand this vintage of the perdition of ungodly men by fire, at the conflagration of the world, which will be at the beginning of the thousand years' reign, and of the gathering of them in at the second resurrection, at the end of it, for the destruction of them in hell, soul and body. And by this "angel" is meant, not the saints of the most High; for though they may be said to come out of the temple, the church, and shall judge the world, yet they will not be employed in gathering together the wicked, and casting them into the lake of fire, or winepress of God's wrath: rather the ministering spirits are intended, who are the reapers at the end of the world, and who will gather the wicked, and bind them like tares in bundles, and cast them into the furnace of fire; though it is best to interpret this of Christ himself, who is often called an Angel in Scripture, as the Angel of God's presence; and the Angel of the covenant; and frequently in this book, as in <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a> because, as Mediator, he is God's messenger; and he may be said to do that, which he does by others, as instruments, as to gather the vine of the earth, and cast it into the winepress; and he may be said to "come out of the temple which is in heaven": whether this be understood of heaven itself, which the temple, and especially the most holy place in it, was a figure of; here Christ is, and from hence he is expected to come, and will come at the last day, as Judge of all the earth; or of the church of God, for here Christ dwells, and grants his gracious and spiritual presence until his second and personal coming, with all his saints: and now he will have them all with him, both quick and dead, and will be personally in his temple, the church, in the great congregation of the righteous, and out from among them will he display his power in the destruction of the wicked; and the rather he may be thought to be intended, since none but a divine person ever trod the winepress of God's wrath; see <a href="/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1</a> to which may be added what follows, <p>he also having a sharp sickle; the same who is described as like to the son of man, on a white cloud, with a golden crown on his head, and such a sickle in his hand, <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a> which is expressive of the same judiciary power and authority. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</span><p>(14) The other type (as I said in) see Geneva Re 14:14 is the vintage: the manner of which is the same as that which went before, except for this, that the grape gathering is more exact in seeking out everything, then is the harvest labour.

He came forth “out of the altar.”[3559] This idea is derived from the <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>, which is to be rendered here “from,”[3560] as little as the <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> in <a href="/revelation/9-13.htm" title="And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,">Revelation 9:13</a>. Its meaning is to be derived from the description (<a href="/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a> sqq.),[3561] in connection with the designation of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> which the angel has over fire.[3562] The same altar beneath which the souls of the martyrs lie, crying for vengeance, and from which not only the fire is taken which, cast upon the earth, gives the signal in general for the trumpet-visions announcing the beginning of the vengeance, but whence, also, in the sixth trumpet-vision especially, the voice sounds that calls forth a destructive army upon the earth, appears significantly in this passage as the proper <span class="ital">place</span> of an angel who transmits the command for the execution of judgment, and who, since he has power over fire,[3563] manifests himself as one whose sending brings an answer to the prayers of the martyrs, and thus, by his entire manner and appearance, recalls the blood-guilt of the enemies whose blood is now to cover the earth (<a href="/revelation/14-20.htm" title="And the wine press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even to the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.">Revelation 14:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΡΎΓΗΣΟΝ</span></span></span>. <a href="/luke/6-44.htm" title="For every tree is known by his own fruit.

Cf. <a href="/revelation/14-16.htm" title="And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.">Revelation 14:16</a>. Here, however, the figure is not limited to the mere cutting-off of the clusters, but the pressing also follows: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἜΒΑΛΕΝ ΕἸς ΤῊΝ ΛΗΝῸΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΥΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤῸΝ ΜΕΓ</span></span></span>. In reference to the remarkable combination of the masc. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΜΕΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> with the fem. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ΛΗΝ</span></span></span>,[3564] cf. Winer, p. 490, who explains the masc. by the fact that <span class="greekheb">ὁ λην</span>. also occurs. But a reason why this change of the gen. has happened is scarcely to be found. At all events, <a href="/proverbs/18-14.htm" title="The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?">Proverbs 18:14</a> should be recalled, where the word <span class="greekheb">רוּח</span> occurs first as masc. because the spirit appears in more forcible activity, and afterwards as fem., because, since it suffers from disease, it is represented in feminine weakness. So, too, the masc. <span class="greekheb">τόν μέγ</span>. could be attached to the ordinary feminine form <span class="greekheb">τὴν λην</span>., because this form appears appropriate to the representation of the wrath of God as active in the pressing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπατήθη ἡ λην</span>. The standing expression: cf. <a href="/joel/3-13.htm" title="Put you in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.">Joel 3:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/63-2.htm" title="Why are you red in your apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the winefat?">Isaiah 63:2</a> sq.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔξωθεν τῆς πόλεως</span>. “The city,” without further designation, cannot be Rome,[3565] but only Jerusalem; yet not the heavenly Jerusalem,[3566] also not Jerusalem so far as the holy city represents the Church,[3567] but the real, earthly Jerusalem, against which, as is stated in <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm" title="And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.">Revelation 20:9</a>, the hosts of the world rush, but will be annihilated there before the holy city.[3568] Incorrectly, Grotius: “This did not occur in the city, because there were no Jews there.”[3569]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αἰμα</span>. In <a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm" title="I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.">Isaiah 63:3</a>, LXX., the blood is also expressly mentioned, which is properly meant by the figure of the juice of grapes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τῶν χαλινῶν τῶν ἰππων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. How fearful the bloodshed is, is illustrated by designating it as a stream of blood which is so deep as to reach to the reins of the horses wading therein, while its extent is given as sixteen hundred furlongs.[3570] In this sense, the first expression, <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἵππ</span>., is understood by almost all expositors;[3571] but the reference to the extent of the stream of blood is not without difficulty. Passing by purely arbitrary explanations,[3572] only two possibilities are offered: either the designation of the measure must be regarded as schematical, whether it depend upon the adoption of an hyperbole not to be urged with respect to details,[3573] or the number four[3574] be considered as a root, and then the number 1,600 reduced to 4 × 4 × 100,[3575] or 40 × 40,[3576] or 4 × 400,[3577] be taken in the sense which Victorin.[3578] and Beda already have; or the sixteen hundred furlongs must be understood accurately and properly, so that the length of Palestine is designated,—according to the statement of Jerome, who[3579] says: “From Dan to Beersheba, which is extended scarcely to the distance of clx. miles.” In accordance with this are the explanations not only of Eichh., Heinr., Züll., Ewald, etc., who[3580] maintained that the scene of <a href="/revelation/14-20.htm" title="And the wine press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even to the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.">Revelation 14:20</a> is in the Holy Land, but also of C. a Lap., etc., who understand by the Holy Land the Church; and of Grot. and Beng., who, in a different respect, wanted to reach the meaning that the bloodshed occurred even beyond the boundaries of Palestine.[3581] But the entire explanation, based upon the statement of Jerome, is hardly tenable, because, if John had wished, by means of a geographical designation of length, to refer to the Holy Land, the number must have been accurate. But this is not the case; for, as a Roman mile contained eight furlongs,[3582] the one hundred and sixty Roman miles of Jerome would correspond to twelve hundred and eighty, but not to sixteen hundred stadia.[3583] It is highly probable, therefore, that the schematic number, which is intended to represent the vast extent of the stream of blood proceeding from the horns of the altar, has grown in a similar way from the number four, which refers to all four ends of the earth,[3584] to that in which, in <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a>, the number one hundred and forty-four thousand has been developed from the holy radical twelve.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3556] Cf. <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm" title="The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:">Revelation 14:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3557] De Wette.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3558] Against Hengstenb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3559] Mentioned in <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm" title="And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.">Revelation 8:3</a> sqq., <a href="/revelation/16-7.htm" title="And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.">Revelation 16:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3560] Ew. i., De Wette, Ebrard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3561] Cf. <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>, <a href="/revelation/9-13.htm" title="And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,">Revelation 9:13</a>, <a href="/revelation/16-7.htm" title="And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.">Revelation 16:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3562] <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πυρ</span>., as <a href="/revelation/11-6.htm" title="These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.">Revelation 11:6</a>; cf. <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
