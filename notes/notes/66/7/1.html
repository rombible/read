Better, And after this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, that there might not blow a wind upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.</span> In the sixth seal the winds had blown, and had shaken violently the fig-tree, causing its untimely figs to drop off: the untimely or winter figs represented those whose religious life was unequal to the strain of trial, and who failed in the crisis to which they were exposed. But is all the fruit shaken off? No; Christ had said that “if a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch;” but that those who abode in Him, purged by their trials, would bring forth more fruit, and the fruit which these bore was not a fruit easily shaken off, but fruit that should remain (<a href="/john/15-6.htm" title="If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.">John 15:6</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm" title="I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.">John 15:5</a>; <a href="/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16</a>). They would not be as winter figs, easily torn from the boughs, for their strength was in God: before the stormy winds of manifold trials had blown they had been sealed with the seal of the living God. This is the scene which is brought before us in this chapter. In it the care of God, who restrains from violence the winds, that they should net shake too soon the immature fruit, the tokens by which the sealed are known and the meaning of their sealing are set forth. The chapter, in fact, answers the solemn question of the last chapter: “Who is able to stand?” The winds are clearly emblems of days of trouble or judgment; as the winds sweep away the chaff and clear the atmosphere, so do judgments try the ungodly, who are like the chaff which the wind driveth away: the storm of God’s judgments shakes the mountains and the wilderness, and strips the oaks of the forest. (Comp. Psalms 29) These winds of judgment are ready to blow from all quarters (four corners of the earth), but they are restrained till the servants of God are sealed. For passages where winds are used as emblems of judgment, see especially <a href="/context/jeremiah/49-36.htm" title="And on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.">Jeremiah 49:36-37</a>, “Upon Elam I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven. And I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, saith the Lord.” Comp, also <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm" title="Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove on the great sea.">Daniel 7:2</a>, “I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.” But those tempests would not arise or shake a single leaf till the securing of God’s servants was accomplished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">After these things </span>— After the former discoveries made to me, which represented the providence of God toward his church and the world, till the downfall of the heathen Roman empire, the state of the church and the world immediately to succeed was also represented to me in the manner following: <span class="ital">— I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth </span>— That is, the north, the south, the east, and the west; <span class="ital">holding the four </span>cardinal <span class="ital">winds of the earth </span>— Keeping them in a state of restraint; <span class="ital">that the wind might not blow upon the earth </span>— That there might be the most entire and complete calm, to represent the peaceful state of things which should succeed the tumultuous and distressing revolutions which had been last discovered to me. Winds are emblems of commotions, and very properly, as they are the natural causes of storms. Thus this figurative expression is used and explained by <a href="/context/jeremiah/49-36.htm" title="And on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come....">Jeremiah 49:36-37</a>; <span class="ital">Upon Elam will I bring the four winds, from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds, &c., for I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, </span>&c. To <span class="ital">hold the winds, </span>therefore, <span class="ital">that they should not blow, </span>is a very proper prophetic emblem of a state of peace and tranquillity. This chapter, it must be observed, is still a continuation of the sixth seal, for the seventh seal is not opened till the beginning of the next chapter. It is a description of the state of the church in Constantine’s time, of the peace and protection that it should enjoy under the civil powers, and of the great accession that should be made to it, both of Jews and Gentiles. Eusebius is very copious upon this subject in several parts of his writings, and hath applied that passage of the psalmist in the version of the Seventy, (<a href="/context/psalms/46-8.htm" title="Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he has made in the earth....">Psalm 46:8-9</a>,) <span class="ital">Come hither, and behold the works of the Lord, what wonders he hath wrought in the earth; he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear asunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire; </span>which things, saith he, being manifestly fulfilled in our times, we rejoice over them. Lactantius also saith, in the same triumphant strain, “Tranquillity being restored throughout the world, the church which was lately ruined riseth again. Now, after the violent agitations of so great a tempest, a calm air and the desired light become resplendent. Now God hath relieved the afflicted. Now he hath wiped away the tears of the sorrowful.” These are testimonies of contemporary writers. Medals of Constantine are still preserved, with the head of this emperor on one side, and this inscription, CONSTANTINUS AUG., and on the reverse, BEATA TRANQUILLITAS, <span class="ital">Blessed Tranquillity.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-8 In the figurative language of Scripture, the blowing of the four winds together, means a dreadful and general destruction. But the destruction is delayed. Seals were used to mark for each person his own possessions. This mark is the witness of the Holy Ghost, printed in the hearts of believers. And the Lord would not suffer his people to be afflicted before they were marked, that they might be prepared against all conflicts. And, observe, of those who are thus sealed by the Spirit, the seal must be on the forehead, plainly to be seen alike by friends and foes, but not by the believer himself, except as he looks stedfastly in the glass of God's word. The number of those who were sealed, may be understood to stand for the remnant of people which God reserved. Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparison with the wicked world, yet it is a society really large, and to be still more enlarged. Here the universal church is figured under the type of Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And after these things - After the vision of the things referred to in the opening of the sixth seal. The natural interpretation would be, that what is here said of the angels and the winds occurred after those things which are described in the previous chapter. The exact chronology may not be always observed in these symbolical representations, but doubtless there is a general order which is observed.<p>I saw four angels - He does not describe their forms, but merely mentions their agency. This is, of course, a symbolical representation. We are not to suppose that it would be literally fulfilled, or that, at the time referred to by the vision, four celestial beings would be stationed in the four quarters of the world for the purpose of checking and restraining the winds that blow from the four points of the compass. The meaning is, that events would occur which would be properly represented by four angels standing in the four quarters of the world, and having power over the winds.<p>Standing on the four corners of the earth - This language is, of course, accommodated to the prevailing mode of speaking of the earth among the Hebrews. It was a common method among them to describe it as a vast plain, having four corners, those corners being the prominent points - north, south, east, and west. So we speak now of the four winds, the four quarters of the world, etc. The Hebrews spoke of the earth, as we do of the rising and setting of the sun and of the motions of the heavenly bodies, according to appearances, and without aiming at philosophical exactness. Compare the notes on <a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7</a>. With this view they spoke of the earth as an extended plain, and as having boundaries or corners, as a plain or field naturally has. Perhaps, also, they used this language with some allusion to an edifice, as having four corners; for they speak also of the earth as having foundations. The language which the Hebrews used was in accordance with the prevailing ideas and language of the ancients on the subject.<p>Holding the four winds of the earth - The winds blow in fact from every quarter, but it is convenient to speak of them as coming from the four principal points of the compass, and this method is adopted probably in every language. So among the Greeks and Latins, the winds were arranged under four classes - Zephyrus, Boreas, Notus, and Eurus - considered as under the control of a king, Aeolus. See Eschenburg, Man. Class. Literally, section 78, compare section 108. The angels here are represented as "holding" the winds - &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  kratountas. That is, they held them back when about to sweep over the earth, and to produce far-spread desolation. This is an allusion to a popular belief among the Hebrews, that the agency of the angels was employed everywhere. It is not suggested that the angels had raised the tempest here, but only that they now restrained and controlled it. The essential idea is, that they had plower over those winds, and that they were now exercising that power by keeping them back when they were about to spread desolation over the earth.<p>That the wind should not blow on the earth - That there should be a calm, as if the winds were held back.<p>Nor on the sea - Nowhere - neither on sea nor land. The sea and the land constitute the surface of the globe, and the language here, therefore, denotes that there would be a universal calm.<p>Nor on any tree - To injure it. The language used here is such as would denote a state of profound quiet; as when we say that it is so still that not a leaf of the trees moves.<p>In regard to the literal meaning of the symbol here employed there can be no great difficulty; as to its application there may be more. The winds are the proper symbols of wars and commotions. Compare <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36-37</a> the symbol is both used and explained: "And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life." So in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1-2</a>, a destroying wind is an emblem of destructive war: "I will raise up against Babylon a destroying wind, and will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land." Compare Horace, Odes, b. i. 14. The essential ideas, therefore, in this portion of the symbol, cannot be mistaken. They are two:<p>(1) that at the period of time here referred to - after the opening of the sixth seal and before the opening of the seventh - there would be a state of things which would be well represented by rising tempests and storms, which if unrestrained would spread desolation afar; and,<p>(2) that this impending ruin was held back as if by angels having control of those winds; that is, those tempests were not suffered to go forth to spread desolation over the world. A suspended tempest calamity held in check; armies hovering on the borders of a kingdom, but not allowed to proceed for a time; hordes of invaders detained, or stayed in their march, as if by some restraining power not their own, and from causes not within themselves - any of these things would be an obvious fulfilling of the meaning of the symbol. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Re 7:1-17. Sealing of the Elect of Israel. The Countless Multitude of the Gentile Elect.<p>1. And&#8212;so B and Syriac. But A, C, Vulgate, and Coptic omit "and."<p>after these things&#8212;A, B, C, and Coptic read, "after this." The two visions in this chapter come in as an episode after the sixth seal, and before the seventh seal. It is clear that, though "Israel" may elsewhere designate the spiritual Israel, "the elect (Church) on earth" [Alford], here, where the names of the tribes one by one are specified, these names cannot have any but the literal meaning. The second advent will be the time of the restoration of the kingdom to Israel, when the times of the Gentiles shall have been fulfilled, and the Jews shall at last say, "Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord." The period of the Lord's absence has been a blank in the history of the Jews as a nation. As then Revelation is the Book of the Second Advent [De Burgh], naturally mention of God's restored favor to Israel occurs among the events that usher in Christ's advent.<p>earth &#8230; sea &#8230; tree&#8212;The judgments to descend on these are in answer to the martyrs' prayer under the fifth seal.

After the opening of six of the seals of the sealed book, and after the demolition of Heathen deities, and of Heathen worship, and of Heathen magistrates, in the Roman empire, and the representation of these to John, he had the following vision; and which therefore does not refer to the preservation of the Christians, before and at the destruction of Jerusalem, which was under the first seal; nor to the security of the saints from the wrath of the Lamb, when it fell upon the Pagan worshippers, of all ranks and degrees, which was under the sixth seal, and was now over; but rather it respects an intermediate space of time between the sixth and seventh seal, as reaching from Constantine to Theodosius; for upon Constantine's being sole emperor, the church enjoyed great peace and tranquillity after the blustering storms of Pagan persecution ceased; and great numbers of God's elect were converted and sealed, and the winds of Heathen persecution were held, and blew no more, unless for a short time under the Emperor Julian; though the church was not free from the wind of error and heresy; and the storms of contention which arose about them, nor from the tempest of Arian persecutions, which were very grievous; wherefore this refers to what should be between the sixth and seventh seal, which brings on the seven trumpets: and now, before John sees that seal opened, a pause is made, and this vision is shown him, to fortify his mind, and all other saints, that are observers of these things, who by the opening of the following seal would see what judgments and plagues would come upon the empire, now become Christian, and what changes and revolutions would be made in it, and might fear that the church of God would be wholly swallowed up and lost; wherefore this vision is exhibited to show, that notwithstanding the devastations by the Goths and Vandals, and the rise, progress, and power of Mahomet, and the dreadful apostasy of the church of Rome, and all the miseries of it, and the plagues that should come upon the church for it; yet God would have throughout all this, and in, every age of time, a sealed number, a true church, hidden and secured, even until the seventh angel has sounded his trumpet, and time shall be no more, and the mystery of God will be finished. <p>I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any trees. Four angels are mentioned, in allusion to the four spirits of the heavens, in <a href="/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>; and though the earth is not a plain square with angles, but round and globular, yet it is said to have four corners, with respect to the four points of the heavens; and though there is but one wind, which blows sometimes one way, and sometimes another, yet four are named with regard to the above points, east, west, north, and south, from whence it blows. These are commonly called "the four winds of heaven", <a href="/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>; but here, of the earth, as in the Targum on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>, and he shall bring near the captivity of Judah,  , "from the four winds of the earth". And such things as are chiefly affected with winds are particularly observed, as the earth, upon which buildings are thrown down by them; and the sea, in which ships are wrecked; and trees, which by the violence of them, are blown down, and torn up by the roots. Some by these angels understand evil angels, who are sometimes called angels, without any additional epithet to distinguish them, and that because a desire of hurting seems to have been in them, as well as a power, <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; and who are, in every part of the world, seeking to do all the mischief they can; and may be said to hold the winds, not in a literal sense, for God only gathers the wind in his fist, and holds it there, and lets it loose at his pleasure; but in a mystical sense, as these may refer to the word, and the ministers of the word, whose progress and success are often hindered by Satan and is emissaries; and some particularly understand by them the four monarchies of the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman; others the four emperors, after that Dioclesian and Maximianus had resigned, as Maximinus, Galerius, Maxentius, and Licinius; others Mahomet, or the Turk, in the east, who hindered the Gospel by his wars and devastations, as well as by false worship; the kings of France and Spain on the west, by fire, and faggot, and sword; and the pope in the south, by bulls and excommunications; and the empire and emperors of Germany on the north, by public edicts; or, in general, all the Popish tribe, popes, cardinals, bishops, priests, monks, and friars, by their decrees, anathemas, sermons, writings, and lying miracles, did all they could that the Gospel might not be preached neither in the earth, on the continent, nor in the sea, or in the islands of it; or that any of the saints, the trees of righteousness, who lived in woods and mountainous places, or were forced to fly into woods, might have any advantage by it. But, after all, rather this is to be understood of good angels, and either of their restraining evil angels from doing mischief, see <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>; or keeping back the winds of false doctrines and heresies from the churches of Christ, in the several parts of the world; or rather, and which is the true sense, of their holding in the storms of calamities and war to the destruction of kingdoms, provinces, islands, and the several inhabitants of them, and intends a general peace throughout the world; see <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>. This mystical way of speaking seems to agree with the notions of the Jews, who speak of angels standing at the gates of the four winds,  "and the keys of the wind in their hands", whose names they give us (x); and make mention of , "the angels of the wind" (y); and the Magi among the Persians call the angel of the wind "Bad", or "Badran" (z). <p>(x) Raziel, fol. 36. 1. 2.

This section is a dialogue and bringing in for this whole chapter by occasion of the prediction and argument of the sixth seal. For first harm is withheld from the elect, Re 7:1-9. Then thanks are given by the elect for that cause Re 7:10-12. Lastly, the accomplishment of it is set forth to the end of the chapter. The first verse is a transition, speaking of the angels who keep the lesser parts from harm, until God commands. For, as in Eze 10:19, their faces and their wings reach up, continually waiting on and watching the countenance of God for their direction and every one of them goes into that part that is right before his face: wherever the Spirit goes, they go, they do not step out of the way, not so much as a foot breadth from the path commanded to them by God.<p>(a) On the four corners or coasts of the earth.<p>(2) That is, neither into the air, into which the trees grow.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">τέσσαρας ἀγγέλους</span>.

For thus Grot, says on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Γῆς</span></span></span>: “viz., Judaea;” on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΈΜΟΥς</span></span></span>: “The winds signify any sort of calamity.” The “sea” is “a great people, such as is that of Jerusalem especially;” the trees designate “what come from trees, as cities, but especially the temple:” in general, the times of peace under King Agrippa are meant. Böhmer regards the “earth” as Jews, the “sea” as heathen; therefore he says that the Christians still to be mentioned are designated by the “trees.” According to Beng., the earth is Asia, the sea Europe, the trees Africa. Hengstenb. also regards “the four winds of the earth” as symbols of the Divine judgments, viz., those described in ch. 6; the “sea” designates masses of people; the “trees” are magnates, <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm" title="And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;">Revelation 6:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But every kind of allegorizing is without the least foundation in the text. The winds which in their proper naturalness are, besides, expressly designated as “the four winds of the earth,” are not once personified here, as in <a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm" title="And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.">Zechariah 6:1</a> sqq.,—where, however, what is said dare not be taken as an allegory in the strict sense,—but as in <a href="/revelation/6-4.htm" title="And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given to him a great sword.">Revelation 6:4</a> an actual shedding of blood, and in <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm" title="And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, see, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;">Revelation 6:12</a> an actual earthquake, so here actual winds are meant, storms which are to have the mastery of the whole earth, as they are also ready to break loose from all four ends of the earth. But in the fact, that, after the dreadful signs of the sixth seal have led immediately to the day of the final judgment, now—as the description of this judgment is to be expected in the seventh, last seal—a visitation of like character, as in the sixth seal, is again set forth, and its infliction restrained until after the sealing of the servants of God from Israel, the intimation is already given that the actual occurrence of the final catastrophe will not be until after the course of a still further manifestation of preliminary afflictions, as they proceed from the seventh seal in long and connected sequence.[2253]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2246] Aret., Zeger, Laun., Calov., Beng., Rinck, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2247] Alcas., C. a Lap., Stern, Heinr., Züll., De Wette.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2248] Vitr., Ewald, Hengstenb., Ebrard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2249] <span class="greekheb">τέσσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">άγγ</span>. = “the four principal kingdoms of the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans;” <span class="greekheb">κρατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνεμ</span>. = “They allow no one to breathe according to the pleasure of his own right;” <span class="greekheb">γῆ</span> = “diversity of provinces;” <span class="greekheb">δένδρ</span>.: “diverse quality of men.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2250] “Hindering the doctors of the Church from preaching the word of God.” Cf. similar interpretations of <span class="greekheb">κρατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τεσσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνέμ</span>.; e.g., in Aret., who regards the wicked angels as the Pope, the Turks, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2251] Cf. <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm" title="And on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm" title="And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.">Zechariah 6:1</a> sqq.; <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm" title="Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove on the great sea.">Daniel 7:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2252] <span class="greekheb">κρατ</span>.

It is impossible and irrelevant to determine whether the winds’ blast and the sealing were already conjoined in the fragment or oral traditions which lay before this editor, or whether their combination is due to himself. They reflect the tradition underlying the synoptic apocalypse (<a href="/context/mark/13-24.htm" title="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,...">Mark 13:24-27</a>, etc., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm" title="And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, see, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;">Revelation 6:12</a> to <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a>), but here the safeguarding of the elect comes before, instead of alter, the advent, and the four winds are agents of destruction instead of mere geographical points; besides, the role of messiah is omitted altogether. It is assumed not merely that these angels are the spirits of the four winds (<a href="/zechariah/6-5.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.">Zechariah 6:5</a>, and repeatedly in Enoch, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, lxix. 22, “the spirits of the waters and of the winds and of all zephyrs”), but that some onset of the winds is imminent (<a href="/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> En. xviii. 22), as part of the horrors of the last catastrophe (for punitive winds, see <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/39-28.htm" title="There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which in their fury lay on sore strokes; in the time of destruction they pour out their force, and appease the wrath of him that made them.">Sir 39:28</a>).

If such allusions are not mere echoes of the present passage, they would appear to indicate a runlet of eschatological tradition flowing behind more important ideas. Or are the saints like trees of God (Ps. Sol. 14:2, 3) never to be uprooted by a wind or onset of foes (<span class="ital">ibid.</span> viii. 6)? It is no longer possible to be sure. In En. <a href="/revelation/18-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.">Revelation 18:1</a> f. by a semi-Babylonian touch, the four winds are identified with the four pillars of the heaven and the foundations of the earth; in Apoc. Bar. vi. 4, 5, four angels with lamps are restrained by another angel from lighting them (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also <span class="ital">E. Bi.</span> 5303). There seems to be no allusion to the notion of a blast (from the sea) as a form of mortal fate (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Oed. <span class="ital">Col.</span> 1659, 1660; <span class="ital">Iliad</span>, vi. 345 f.); on the contrary, the idea goes back to <a href="/zechariah/6-8.htm" title="Then cried he on me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.">Zechariah 6:8</a> (LXX), whence the prophet had already developed <a href="/context/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see....">Revelation 6:1-8</a>.

But the Apocalypse like Philo, stands severely apart from the current Stoic notion, adopted in Sib. iv. 172 f.; 2 Peter, etc., of a destruction of the world by means of a final conflagration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>The Vision of the Four Angels of the Four Winds. Chap. 7 <a href="/context/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree....">Revelation 7:1-3</a><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">four angels</span>] Presumably the Angels of the four winds, as we have other elemental Angels in <a href="/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18</a>, <a href="/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>. Cf. <a href="/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>, of which the probable sense is, “Who maketh His Angels winds,” i.e. sends them into the air to cause the wind to blow, so that the wind is the manifestation of their presence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on the four corners of the earth</span>] Probably the four cardinal points, the extreme north, south, east, and west of it. It is hardly likely that the “four winds of the earth” should be conceived as NE., SW., SE., and NW.: in the climate of the Levant, there would not be as much physical truth in such a classification as in our own, and the usage of nomenclature, in Greek and still more in Hebrew, proves that the four winds are N., E., S., W. We therefore cannot argue from the “four corners” that St John conceives the earth is a rectangle—for it would be most unnatural to conceive it as set <span class="ital">corner-wise:</span> in <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm" title="And on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.">Jeremiah 49:36</a>, the four winds blow from the four <span class="ital">ends</span> of the earth. But it appears that the machinery, so to speak, throughout the vision does imply that the earth is conceived as a plane. St John is in Heaven, and is able to look down (or even to go down) to the earth, which he sees spread beneath him like a map, from Euphrates to Rome and very likely further. We have somewhat similar language in Enoch xviii. 3, “I also beheld the four winds which bear up the earth and the firmament of heaven.” But St John does not, like Pseudo-Enoch, put forward his imagery as absolute physical truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that the wind should not blow</span>] Every one will remember Keble’s beautiful illustration of this image, by the natural phenomenon of the “All Saints’ Summer.” But the next <span class="ital">v.</span> shews, that it is by the Angels’ action that the winds blow, as well as that they are restrained from blowing: we are not to conceive the winds (as in <span class="ital">Od.</span> X., <span class="ital">Aen.</span> I.) as wild expansive forces, that will blow if not mechanically confined.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄνεμος</span>, <span class="ital">the wind</span>) <span class="ital">The winds</span> in this passage denote the assuaging mitigations of threatening evils; for the <span class="ital">holding</span> of them <span class="ital">back hurts</span>, <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>.

But, even if not looked upon as an integral part of the revelations made under the sixth seal, the connection is so close that the two must be regarded practically as one. The incidents of the seventh chapter are evidently the complement of those narrated in the closing verses of the sixth. They take up the question with which that chapter closes, "Who is able to stand?" and afford comfort and help to those suffering Christians who were so sorely in need of a renewed assurance of the certainty of their final reward. It seems better, therefore, on the whole, to consider the sixth seal to extend to the end of <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. Vitringa takes this view, which appears to be supported also by Wordsworth. Alford, while separating <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. from <a href="/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>, as "two episodes," remarks, "The great day of the Lord's judgment is not described; it is all but brought before us under the sixth seal, and is actually going on in the first of these episodes." <span class="cmt_word">I saw four angels.</span> Of the nature of these angels we are told nothing. They are evidently ministers of God's will, and the mention of them following immediately upon the preceding description seems to connect the whole account more closely with <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29, 30</a>, where the angels gather the elect from the four winds. It does not seem probable that "evil angels" are meant as understood by some writers, since what they do is apparently done at the command of God. <span class="cmt_word">Standing on the four corners of the earth</span>. That is, standing in the four opposite directions, and thus controlling all the earth (cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>). The number four is the symbol of universality and of creation (see on Revelation 5:9). <span class="cmt_word">Holding the four winds of the earth</span> (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). The angels may have been the "angels of the winds," just as in <a href="/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a> an angel has power over fire, and in <a href="/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a> we read of the "angel of the waters." The <span class="accented">winds</span> have been interpreted in two ways, neither of which seems strictly correct. The first is to give a literal meaning (as Dusterdieck) to the winds, and to understand literal windstorms as part of the judgment upon the earth. The second method interprets the winds as symbols of the judgments of the first six seals, which are held in suspension, while the elect are sealed. The truth probably is that the <span class="accented">winds</span>, like the <span class="accented">earthquake</span>, the rolling up of the heaven as a scroll, etc., are part of the figurative description of the destruction of the world at the judgment day; which destruction, like that of Sodom, is delayed for the preservation of God's elect. <span class="cmt_word">That the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "every tree," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, P, l, 36, Andreas, etc. The earth, the sea, the trees, are mentioned as things likely to be affected by the action of the winds; the two former, of course, embracing those things situated upon them, and the last being specially mentioned, perhaps, as a class of things which are peculiarly liable to destruction from wind. Wordsworth and others, interpreting symbolically, consider that the blasts of wind on the earth typify earthly powers, opposed to those of heaven, while the sea is emblematic of nations in a state of agitation against God, and the trees represent the great ones of this world. This interpretation, therefore, regards the objects mentioned as the enemies of God, which, by his command, are preserved from destruction and allowed to flourish in ease and apparent security, until the time of the sealing of God's servants has been accomplished. But it seems better to regard the winds as forming part of the general description by which God's judgment is foreshadowed. It is not unusual in the Bible for the wind to be mentioned in connection With destruction and judgment (cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>; <a href="/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="/job/30-15.htm">Job 30:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-18.htm">Psalm 147:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-8.htm">Isaiah 27:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>: <a href="/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>These things (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>Read &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; this.<p>Holding (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Holding fast or firmly.
