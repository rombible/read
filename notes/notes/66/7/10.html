The salvation here must, I think, be taken in its most comprehensive sense, including every deliverance—from the curse of law, from the power of sin, and from the perils of life. The explanation in <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm" title="And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.">Revelation 7:14</a> confirms this.

This is “the voice of rejoicing and salvation which is in the tabernacles of the righteous,” when the Lord, who is their strength and song, “has become their salvation” (<a href="/psalms/118-14.htm" title="The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.">Psalm 118:14</a>). Note the recurrence of “the Lamb.” They are before the throne and before the Lamb; their salvation is ascribed to God and to the Lamb.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/7-10.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sits on the throne, and to the Lamb....">Revelation 7:10-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And cried with a loud voice </span>— In token of the intenseness of their devotion; <span class="ital">saying, Salvation to our God </span>— That is, Let the salvation which we have attained be ascribed to him; <span class="ital">which sitteth upon the throne </span>— And from thence has graciously regarded us, and exalted us to such dignity and happiness, mean and miserable as we once were. <span class="ital">And unto the Lamb </span>— Let it be also ascribed to the mediation and grace of the Lamb, who gave himself to be slain for our redemption.

This vision, especially when compared with the former, in the fourth and fifth chapters, Lowman also thinks is to be understood of the church in heaven; because, as heaven seems to be the proper scene of the vision, so the innumerable company of saints, with whom the angels join in the following words, in the presence of God and the Lamb, is most naturally to be understood of those who, having been faithful unto death, have received the crown of immortal life in the state of heavenly happiness. And he questions whether the praises of the church on earth can answer this prophetic description, or the intention of the prophetic Spirit, in the great encouragement it designed to give to faithfulness and constancy. He thinks, to understand it of the heavenly church, is a natural sense of the expressions, and a sense proper to the design of the prophecy, as it represents the faithful martyrs and confessors, once so great sufferers on earth, now blessed saints in heaven. <span class="ital">And all the angels stood </span>— In waiting; <span class="ital">round the throne, and the elders, and the four </span>living creatures — That is, the living creatures next the throne, the elders round these, and the angels round them both; <span class="ital">and fell before the throne </span>— Of the Divine Majesty; <span class="ital">on their faces </span>— So do the elders once only, <a href="/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 11:16</a>; <span class="ital">and worshipped God </span>— Joining in the same act of worship and thanksgiving with the saints; <span class="ital">saying, Amen </span>— So let it be!

In acts of religious worship we come nigh to God, and must come by Christ; the throne of God could not be approached by sinners, were it not for a Mediator. They were clothed with the robes of justification, holiness, and victory; and they had palms in their hands, as conquerors used to appear in their triumphs. Such a glorious appearance will the faithful servants of God make at last, when they have fought the good fight of faith, and finished their course. With a loud voice they gave to God and the Lamb the praise of the great salvation. Those who enjoy eternal happiness must and will bless both the Father and the Son; they will do it publicly, and with fervour. We see what is the work of heaven, and we ought to begin it now, to have our hearts much in it, and to long for that world where our praises, as well as our happiness, will be made perfect.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And cried with a loud voice - Compare <a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>. This is expressive of the greatness of their joy; the ardor and earnestness of their praise.<p>Salvation to our God - The word rendered "salvation" - &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  so&#772;te&#772;ria - means properly "safety, deliverance, preservation"; then welfare or prosperity; then victory; then, in a Christian sense, deliverance from punishment and admission to eternal life. Here the idea seems to be that their deliverance from sin, danger, persecution, and death, was to be ascribed solely to God. It cannot be meant, as the words would seem to imply, that they desired that God might have salvation; but the sense is, that their salvation was to be attributed entirely to him. This will undoubtedly be the song of the released forever, and all who reach the heavenly world will feel that they owe their deliverance from eternal death, and their admission to glory, wholly to him. Prof. Robinson (Lexicon) renders the word "victory" here. The fair meaning is, that whatever is included in the word "salvation" will be due to God alone - the deliverance from sin, danger, and death; the triumph over every foe; the resurrection from the grave; the rescue from eternal burnings; the admission to a holy heaven - victory in all that that word implies will be due to God.<p>Which sitteth upon the throne - notes on <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>.<p>And unto the Lamb - notes on <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>. God the Father, and He who is the Lamb of God, alike claim, the honor of salvation. It is observable here that the redeemed ascribe their salvation to the Lamb as well as to Him who is on the throne. Could they do this if he who is referred to as the "Lamb" were a mere man? Could they if he were an angel? Could they if he were not equal with the Father? Do those who are in heaven worship a creature? Will they unite a created being with the Anointed One in acts of solemn adoration and praise? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. cried&#8212;Greek, "cry," in the three oldest manuscripts, A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, and Coptic.
