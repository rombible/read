But whether the one thousand years are here to be taken literally, as is most probable; or whether here [as elsewhere in this book] each day is put for a year, and consequently the whole period be three hundred and sixty thousand years, I will not pretend to determine. This thought has been very lately started by an ingenious and worthy person, who, I doubt not, hath intended the service of Christianity; though I am very apprehensive he has failed in some of the mediums by which he has endeavoured to prove this point.” <span class="ital">And cast him into the bottomless pit</span> — His infernal prison; afterward he is cast into the lake of fire; <span class="ital">and shut him up </span>therein, <span class="ital">and set a seal upon him </span>— These are strong figures, to show the certain, strict, and severe restraint which he shall be laid under; <span class="ital">that he might deceive the nations no more — </span>During this whole period. One benefit only is here expressed as resulting from the confinement of Satan; but how many and great blessings are implied! For the grand enemy and opposer of truth and righteousness being removed, the kingdom of God holds on its uninterrupted course among the nations; and the great <span class="ital">mystery of God, </span>so long foretold, is at length <span class="ital">fulfilled </span>— Namely, when the beast and false prophet are destroyed, and Satan bound. This fulfilment approaches nearer and nearer, and contains things of the utmost importance, the knowledge of which becomes every day more distinct and easy. In the mean time, it is highly necessary to guard against the present rage and subtlety of the devil; remembering that the events which are to precede the binding of him, and the commencing of these one thousand years, are awful, and shortly to be expected, one after another, namely, the calamities implied in the vintage, (<a href="/revelation/14-18.htm" title="And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.">Revelation 14:18</a>,) the pouring out of the last three vials, the judgment of Babylon, the last raging of the beast and false prophet, and their destruction. How great things are these! and how short the time! What is needful for us? Wisdom, patience, faithfulness, watchfulness. Surely this is not a time for us to settle upon our lees. This, if it be rightly understood, will not be an acceptable message to the wise, the mighty, the honourable of this world. Yet that which is to be done shall be done: there is no counsel against the Lord. <span class="ital">After that he must be loosed </span>— So does the mysterious wisdom of God permit; for <span class="ital">a little season </span>— For a small time, comparatively: though, upon the whole, it cannot be very short, because the things that are to be transacted therein (see <a href="/context/revelation/20-8.htm" title="And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea....">Revelation 20:8-9</a>) must take up a considerable space.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-3 Here is a vision, showing by a figure the restraints laid on Satan himself. Christ, with Almighty power, will keep the devil from deceiving mankind as he has hitherto done. He never wants power and instruments to break the power of Satan.

He does not say whether this angel had appeared to him before, but the impression is rather that it was a different one. The whole character of the composition of the book leads us to suppose that different angels were employed to make these communications to John, and that, in fact, in the progress of things disclosed in the book, he had contact with a considerable number of the heavenly inhabitants. The scene that is recorded here occurred after the destruction of the beast and the false prophet <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm">Revelation 19:18-21</a>, and therefore, according to the principles expressed in the explanation of the previous chapters, what is intended to be described here will take place after the final destruction of the papal and Muhammedan powers.<p>Having the key of the bottomless pit - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>.

All Christ's enemies, and Satan's instruments being removed, the devil is left alone, and only stands in the way of Christ's kingdom; and what will be done to him, and how he will be in the issue disposed of, this vision gives an account: by the "angel" John saw, is not to be understood Constantine the great; for though he is the man child that was taken up to God, and his throne, being advanced to the empire, yet he cannot, with that propriety, be said to come down from heaven; and though he vanquished the Heathen emperors, in which the dragon presided, and cast Paganism out of the empire, by which the devil ruled in it, yet the binding of Satan is another kind of work, and seems too great for him; and besides, did not take place in his time, as will be seen hereafter: nor is an apostle, or a minister of the Gospel intended; such are indeed called angels in this book, and may be said to come down from heaven, because they have their commission from thence; and particularly the apostles had the keys of the kingdom of heaven, but not the key of the bottomless pit; and a chain and system of Gospel truths, which they made good use of for the establishing of Christ's kingdom, and weakening of Satan's, but not such a chain as is here meant; and they had the power of binding and loosing, or of declaring things lawful or unlawful, but not of binding and loosing of Satan; nor was he bound in the apostolic age: nor is one of the ministering spirits, or a deputation of angels designed; for though Christ will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, and will make use of them, both to gather together his elect, and to cast the wicked into the lake of fire, yet not to bind Satan; but the Lord Jesus Christ himself is this angel, who is the angel of God's presence, and of the covenant; and who is in this book called an angel, <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a> to whom all the characters here well agree, and to whom the work of binding Satan most properly belongs; for who so fit to do it, or so capable of it, as the seed of the woman, that has bruised serpent's head, or as the Son of God, who was manifested to destroy the works of the devil, yea, to destroy him himself; and who dispossessed multitudes of devils from the bodies of men, and is the strong man armed that dislodges Satan from the souls of men, and is the same with Michael, who drove him from heaven, and cast him out from thence before,  <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>. And his coming down from heaven is not to be understood of his incarnation, or of his coming from thence by the assumption of human nature; for Satan was not bound by him then, as will be seen hereafter; but of his second coming, which will be from heaven, where he now is, and will be local, visible, and personal: of no other coming of his does this book speak, as seen by John, or as future; nor will the order of this vision, after the ruin of the beast and false prophet, admit of any other. <p>Having the key of the bottomless pit: the abyss or deep, the same out of which the beast ascended, <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>. And the key of this becomes no hand so well as his who has the keys of hell and death, <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a> who has all power in heaven and in earth, and has the power of hell, of opening and shutting it at his pleasure, which is signified by this phase; see <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1</a>. The Ethiopic version reads, "the key of the sun", where some have thought hell to be; and yet the same version renders the word, the deep, in <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>. <p>And a great chain in his hand; the key in one hand, and the chain in another; by which last is meant, not any material chain, with which spirits cannot be bound, nor indeed sometimes bodies possessed by evil spirits, <a href="/mark/5-3.htm">Mark 5:3</a> but the almighty power of Christ, which he will now display in binding Satan faster and closer than ever. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</span><p>(1) Now follows the third part of the prophetic history, which is of the victory by which Christ overcame the dragon, as I noted in Re 7:1. This part must necessarily be joined with the end of the twelfth chapter and be applied to the correct understanding of it. This chapter has two parts, one of the dragon overcome, to Re 20:2-10: the other of the resurrection and last judgment to Re 20:11-15. The story of the dragon is twofold: First of the first victory, after which he was bound by Christ, to the sixth verse Re 20:1-6. The second is of the last victory, by which he has thrown down into everlasting punishment, there to the fifteenth verse Re 20:7-15. This first history happened in the first time of the Christian Church, when the dragon thrown down from heaven by Christ, went about to molest the new birth of the Church in the earth, Re 12:17,18:1. For which cause I gave warning, that this story of the dragon must be joined to that passage.<p>(2) That is, of hell, where God threw the angels who had sinned, and bound them in chains of darkness to be kept till damnation, 2Pe 2:4</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/20.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/revelation/20-1.htm" title="And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand....">Revelation 20:1-3</a>.

The abyss of hell is the place where Satan properly belongs, and whence he himself, like the demoniacal powers, has proceeded in order to work upon earth. But since for a thousand years he will be confined against his will to one place,[4149] so long is his agency on earth interrupted (<span class="greekheb">ἳνα μὴ πλαν</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔκλεισεν καὶ ἐσφράγισεν ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ</span>. With <span class="greekheb">ἔκλεισεν</span> the object <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἄβυσσον</span> is understood; but just because this is not expressly added, the limitation <span class="greekheb">ἐπάνω αὐτοὺ</span> can the more readily qualify the <span class="greekheb">ἐσφράγισεν</span>: “upon him,” i.e., Satan, who has been cast into the bottomless pit, the angel “set a seal,” in order to give the greater assurance of the secure guarding of the one imprisoned.[4150]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἴνα μὴ πλανήσῃ ἔτι τὺ ἔθνη</span>. As he had previously done,[4151] as long as unbound, he could exercise his wrath on earth.[4152] The subj. aor., with a future meaning,[4153] presupposes that during the one thousand years, and, therefore, after the act of judgment, <a href="/revelation/19-21.htm" title="And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.">Revelation 19:21</a>, there would still be nations who also, at the end of the one thousand years, would be actually led astray.[4154] This seeming difficulty would be avoided by the reading <span class="greekheb">πλανᾷ</span>, which depends upon the view customary in the Church fathers, but absolutely in violation of the context, that the worldly period of one thousand years began with the birth or death of Christ, and, therefore, is the present.[4155]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μετὰ ταῦτα</span>; viz., <span class="greekheb">τὰ χίλια ἔτη</span>.

The prophet thus welds together two traditions which were originally independent. The former echoes Egyptian (<span class="ital">E. B. D.</span> 4, “thine enemy the serpent hath been given over to the fire, the serpent-fiend hath fallen down headlong; his arms have been bound in chains … the children of impotent revolt shall never more rise up”) and especially Parsee eschatology (Hübschmann, 227 f.) which held that one sign of the latter days was the release of the dragon Dahâka—once bound fast at mount Demavend—to corrupt the earth and eventually to be destroyed prior to the advent of the messiah and the resurrection of the dead. The Iranian view was that Fredun could not kill the serpent, whose slaughter was reserved for for Sâme (Bund. xxix. 9). But John abstains from giving any reason for the devil’s reappearance. He simply accepts the tradition and falls back (<a href="/revelation/20-3.htm" title="And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.">Revelation 20:3</a>) piously upon the <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> of a mysterious providence. Some enigmatic hints in a late post-exilic apocalypse (<a href="/context/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth....">Isaiah 24:21-22</a>, the hosts on high and the kings on earth to be shut up in the prison of the pit but—after many days—to be visited, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, released), upon which John has already drawn, had been developed by subsequent speculation (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the fettering of Azazel, En. 10:4 f., 54:5 f.) into the dogma of a divine restraint placed for a time upon the evil spirit(s); see <span class="ital">S.
