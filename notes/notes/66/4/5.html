Perhaps it is better to view them as the tokens of God’s power of judgment than as hints of immediately approaching judgments. The scene at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16</a>) was no doubt in the prophet’s mind. There the clouds and lightnings were not so much tokens of coming judgment as the symbols of that righteous power which can show itself in judgment. “Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and judgment are the habitation of His throne” (<a href="/psalms/97-2.htm" title="Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.">Psalm 97:2</a>). They are the constant tokens of that power of God<p>“Which makes the darkness and the light,<p>And dwells not in the light alone,<p>But in the darkness and the cloud<p>As over Sinai's peaks of old.”<p><span class= "bld">And there were seven lamps </span>(or, <span class= "ital">torches)</span> of <span class= "bld">fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.—</span>See <a href="/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>. The Spirit of God in His manifold powers is thus described under emblems of fire. Not merely as a fire of judgment. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a baptism of fire (<a href="/context/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11-12</a>). The flaming presence purges the spirit from sin. The Holy Spirit consumes evil. It is an unquenchable fire against all evils, whether in men’s hearts or in men’s lives, or in the world. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1Corinthians 3:13</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a>.) May there not be allusion to the covenant with Abraham, which was ratified by fire? Lamps, or torches, of fire <span class= "ital">(lampades puros</span>, LXX., same as in this passage) went between the divided pieces of the heifer and the she-goat. If this be correct, the vision of this chapter reminds us that God is ever mindful of His covenant. The rainbow, the token of the covenant with Noah; the flaming torches, tokens of the covenant with Abraham; and the thunderings and lightnings, the tokens of the covenant at Sinai, are ever with Him. (Comp, also <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices - Expressive of the majesty and glory of Him that sat upon it. We are at once reminded by this representation of the sublime scene that occurred at Sinai <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, where "there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud."

Lost, b. vi.<p>The word "voices" here connected with "thunders" perhaps means "voices even thunders" - referring to the sound made by the thunder. The meaning is, that these were echoing and re-echoing sounds, as it were a multitude of voices that seemed to speak on every side.<p>And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne - Seven burning lamps that constantly shone there, illuminating the whole scene. These steadily burning lamps would add much to the beauty of the vision.<p>Which are the seven Spirits of God - Which represent, or are emblematic of, the seven Spirits of God. On the meaning of the phrase, "the seven Spirits of God," see the notes on <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>. If these lamps are designed to be symbols of the Holy Spirit, according to the interpretation proposed in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, it may be perhaps in the following respects:<p>(1) They may represent the manifold influences of that Spirit in the world - as imparting light; giving consolation; creating the heart anew; sanctifying the soul, etc.<p>(2) they may denote that all the operations of that Spirit are of the nature of light, dissipating darkness, and vivifying and animating all things.<p>(3) perhaps their being placed here before the throne, in the midst of thunder and lightning, may be designed to represent the idea that - amidst all the scenes of magnificence and grandeur; all the storms, agitations, and tempests on the earth; all the political changes; all the convulsions of empire under the providence of God; and all the commotions in the soul of man, produced by the thunders of the law - the Spirit of God beams calmly and serenely, shedding a steady influence over all, like lamps burning in the very midst of lightnings, and thunderings, and voices. In all the scenes of majesty and commotion that occur on the earth, the Spirit of God is present, shedding a constant light, and undisturbed in his influence by all the agitations that are abroad. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. proceeded&#8212;Greek, "proceed."<p>thunderings and voices&#8212;The two oldest manuscripts transpose, "voices and thunderings."

The allusion is to the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, when such things were seen and heard, <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> or else the judgments of God, and the punishments inflicted upon his enemies, and the enemies of his church and people, and his awful threatenings of them, may be designed; see <a href="/psalms/18-13.htm">Psalm 18:13</a>; with which compare <a href="/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>. <p>And there were seven lamps of burning fire before the throne,  <p>which are the seven spirits of God; in allusion to the seven lamps in the tabernacle and temple, which were trimmed by the priests, and always kept burning, and are expressive of the Spirit, and his gifts; and these being signified by the number "seven", denote the fulness and perfection of them; and being said to be "before the throne", show that there is always a sufficiency of them for the supply of the churches in all ages, to fit and qualify proper persons to minister the word, and administer ordinances; and these being called "lamps of burning fire", point at the light the Spirit of God in his gifts communicates to the churches; and that warmth and heat, comfort and refreshment; conveyed to them, through the preaching of the Gospel, and the dispensation of the ordinances of it, under his illuminating and quickening influences. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and <i>there were</i> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</span><p>(6) By effects, in that most mightily he speaks all things by his voice and word, Ps 29:3 and with the light of his Spirit and prudence peruses and passes through all.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/revelation/4-5.htm" title="And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunder and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.">Revelation 4:5</a>. The throne of God corresponds in its appearance to the majesty of the king sitting thereon. As in Psalms 29.,[1743] the regal[1744] omnipotence of God is made visible in the violence of the thunder-storm, so John here uses the same image in order to describe the unlimited omnipotence of the enthroned one, particularly as exercised in judgment. The throne itself, out of which proceeded “the lightnings, thunderings, and voices,” appears filled with this sign of the Divine omnipotence. The <span class="greekheb">φωναί</span> which are here distinguished from the <span class="greekheb">βρονταί</span>—so that passages as <a href="/revelation/6-1.htm" title="And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.">Revelation 6:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/10-3.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.">Revelation 10:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2</a>,[1745] must not be here compared,—have[1746] to be regarded as the roar which in a storm accompanies the thunder and lightning.[1747] The misunderstandings of the description depend upon the crudeness and arbitrariness of the exposition. So in N. de Lyra:[1748] “The coruscation of miracles, and declaration of rewards for good and the terror of punishments for evil deeds.” Solely on account of the <span class="greekheb">ἐκπορεύονται</span>,”[1749] Aretius understood by the <span class="greekheb">ἀστραπ</span>., <span class="greekheb">φων</span>., and <span class="greekheb">βροντ</span>., even, the Holy Ghost. De Wette[1750] discerns in the lightning, etc., figures of God’s manifestations of power and life in nature, which are to be distinguished, as “critical and powerful revelations of God,” from the <span class="ital">seven lamps</span> as “his calm and perpetual influences;” while in <a href="/context/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind....">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, “nature itself, or the realm of the living,” and finally in <a href="/context/revelation/4-9.htm" title="And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who lives for ever and ever,...">Revelation 4:9-11</a>, “the harmony of creation with redeemed humanity, and thus God in his living efficiency and reality,” are brought into consideration. But this interpretation is in more than one respect without foundation. The lightning, voices, and thunder are, according to the O. T. view, on which the present description depends,[1751] not figures of the revelation of God in <span class="ital">nature</span> as distinct from another revelation, but of the unlimited power of God, especially as judging;[1752] only we dare not, with Grot., understand the <span class="greekheb">ἀστρ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">βροντ</span>. of general threats, but the <span class="greekheb">φων</span>. of particular afflictions. The throne whence the lightning, etc., proceeds, agrees with that whose form appears to be not only like jasper, but also like a <span class="ital">sardine</span> stone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καῖ ἑπτὰ λαμπάδες πυρὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The authentic explanation immediately follows: <span class="greekheb">αἵ εἰσι τὰ ἑπτὰ πνεύματα τοῦ θεοῦ</span>. Cf., besides, <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm" title="John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;">Revelation 1:4</a>. The pragmatic significance of the Spirit of God in this connection is not that the Spirit of God “is the principle of the psychical[1753] and spiritual life, and that through him the inner influence of God on nature and the human world occurs;”[1754] for the idea of the <span class="greekheb">λαμπάδες πυρός</span> does not suit the explanation of the closely connected first half of the verse. But Hengstenb. also, who very arbitrarily combines the “seven” of the Spirit with the “three” of the lightning, voices, and thunder, into a “ten,” and herein finds indicated a connection of the Spirit with that lightning, etc., improperly thinks only of an operation of the Spirit, “bringing corruption, punishing, and annihilating.” If also the idea of the work of the Spirit in judging[1755] dare not be left out of consideration, partly because of what precedes, and partly because of the expression, <span class="greekheb">πυρός</span>; on the one hand, the expression <span class="greekheb">λαμπάδες</span>, and, on the other, the parallel <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a> (<span class="greekheb">ὀφθαλμοί</span>), indicate that the Spirit is to be regarded chiefly as illuminating, seeing, searching all things,[1756] and just on that account everywhere[1757] active in his holy judgments.

The impression of awe is heightened by traits from the primitive Semitic theophany which, especially in judgment, was commonly associated with a thunderstorm (<span class="greekheb">φωναί</span> = the shrieks and roaring blasts of the storm). Thunder in the Apocalypse is either a sort of chorus in praise of God (as here) or punitive (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/revelation/16-18.htm" title="And there were voices, and thunders, and lightning; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were on the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.">Revelation 16:18</a>); in Enoch lix. 1 the seer beholds the secrets of the thunder, “how it ministers unto well-being and blessing, or serves for a curse before the Lord of Spirits”.

Bar. xxi. 6, where “holy living creatures, without number, of flame and fire” surround the throne. Fulness, intensity, energy, are implied in the figure, which reflects the traditional association (in the primitive mind) of fire and flame with the divinity, and especially with the divine purity or holiness of which they were regarded as an outward expression. There may be an allusion to the <span class="ital">ignes aeterni or sempiterni</span> of Roman mythology, an equivalent for the heavenly bodies; but Jewish eschatology had for over two centuries been familiar with the seven watchers of the heavenly court and their counterparts in Persian and Babylonian mythology.

Seven burning altars, evidently representing a planetary symbolism, also occur in the cult of Mithra, while in the imageless temple of Melcarth at Gades fires always burned upon the altar, tended by whiterobed priests.—5 <span class="ital">c</span> reads like an editorial comment or a liturgical gloss; the <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτεροι</span>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, are undefined.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">seven</span>] Typified by the seven lamps of the candlestick in the Tabernacle, and represented by the “seven golden candlesticks” of the Church on earth: see on <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.
