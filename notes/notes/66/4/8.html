The word “holy” is repeated eight times in the Sinaitic version.

Some have understood these living beings to betoken rather the creative power of God than the actual creation. There is much to be said for this; but the analogy of the passage suits better the view here adopted. The twenty-four elders represent, not the regenerating power of God, but the regenerate Church. The new creation in Christ Jesus join in praise with all created things. The doxology in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a> favours the interpretation, “Thou hast created all things.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the four living creatures </span>— With an allusion to the seraphim represented in Isaiah’s vision; <span class="ital">had each of them six wings about him — </span>Which they used in part to express their reverence and humility, and in part to show readiness and expedition in performing the orders and commands of God. See on <a href="/context/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly....">Isaiah 6:2-3</a>. <span class="ital">And they were full of eyes within </span>— Bengelius reads <span class="greekheb">κυκλοθεν και εσωθεν γεμουσιν οφθαλμων</span>, <span class="ital">round about and within they are full of eyes: round about </span>signifying their attention to and knowledge of the state of the world and church in general; or rather, perhaps, their vigilance and circumspection, their attention to their duty to God and man, and their watchful observance of the designs, wiles, devices, and various motions and snares of their spiritual enemies; and they are said to be <span class="ital">full of eyes within, </span>to signify their self-knowledge, their diligent attention to the state of their own hearts, and the various workings of their passions and appetites, their affections and thoughts. <span class="ital">And they rest not </span>— O happy unrest! <span class="ital">day and night — </span>They are incessant in the spiritual worship, adoration, and praise of him who is a Spirit; and at all proper opportunities they unite in acts of solemn and external worship; <span class="ital">saying </span>— With their lips, as well as in their hearts; <span class="ital">Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which </span>ever <span class="ital">was, and </span>now <span class="ital">is, and is </span>still <span class="ital">to come </span>— Or, for ever will be; the one true God, the everlasting Lord, the Supreme Governor of all beings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are two words in the original very different from each other, both which we translate <span class="ital">holy. </span>The one, <span class="greekheb">οσιος</span>, means properly, <span class="ital">merciful: </span>but the other, <span class="greekheb">αγιος</span>, which occurs here, implies much more. “This holiness is the sum of all the praise which is given to the Almighty Creator, for all that he does and reveals concerning himself, till the new song brings with it new matter of glory. This word properly signifies <span class="ital">separated. </span>And when God is termed holy, it denotes that excellence which is altogether peculiar to himself; and the glory flowing from all his attributes conjoined, shining forth from all his works, and darkening all things besides itself, whereby he is, and eternally remains, in an incomprehensible manner, <span class="ital">separate, </span>and at a distance, not only from all that is impure, but likewise from all that is created. God is <span class="ital">separate </span>from all things. He is, and works from himself, out of himself, in himself, through himself, for himself. Therefore he is the First and the Last, the only One, and the Eternal; living and happy, endless and unchangeable, almighty, omniscient, wise and true, just and faithful, gracious and merciful. When God is spoken of, he is often named, <span class="ital">The Holy One. </span>And as God swears by his name, so he does also by his holiness, that is, by himself. This holiness is often styled glory; often his holiness and glory are celebrated together, <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm" title="Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm" title="And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.">Isaiah 6:4</a>. For holiness is covered glory, and glory is uncovered holiness. The Scripture speaks abundantly of the holiness and glory of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And hereby is the mystery of the Holy Trinity eminently confirmed. That is also termed <span class="ital">holy, </span>which is consecrated to him, and for that end <span class="ital">separated </span>from other things. And so is that wherein we may be like God, or united to him. In the hymn resembling this, recorded by Isaiah, (<a href="/revelation/6-3.htm" title="And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.">Revelation 6:3</a>,) is added, <span class="ital">The whole earth is full of his glory. </span>But this is deferred in the Revelation, till the glory of the Lord (his enemies being destroyed) fills the earth.” — Wesley.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him - An emblem common to them all, denoting that, in reference to each and all the things here symbolized, there was one common characteristic - that in heaven there is the utmost promptness in executing the divine commands. Compare <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>. No mention is made of the manner in which these wings were arranged, and conjecture in regard to that is vain. The seraphim, as seen by Isaiah, had each one six wings, with two of which the face was covered, to denote profound reverence; with two the feet, or lower parts - emblematic of modesty; and with two they flew - emblematic of their celerity in executing the commands of God, <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>. Perhaps without impropriety we may suppose that, in regard to these living beings seen by John, two of the wings of each were employed, as in Isaiah, to cover the face - token of profound reverence; and that the remainder were employed in flight denoting the rapidity with which the divine commands are executed. Mercury, the messenger of Jupiter among the pagan, was represented with wings, and nothing is more common in the paintings and basreliefs of antiquity than such representations.<p>And they were full of eyes within - Prof. Stuart more correctly renders this, "around and within are full of eyes"; connecting the word "around" ("about"), not with the wings, as in our version, but with the eyes. The meaning is, that the portions of the beasts that were visible from the outside of the throne, and the portions under or within the throne, were covered with eyes. The obvious design of this is to mark the universal vigilance of divine providence.<p>And they rest not - Margin, have no rest. That is, they are constantly employed; there is no intermission. The meaning, as above explained, is, that the works and ways of God are constantly bringing praise to him.<p>Day and night - Continually. They who are employed day and night fill up the whole time - for this is all.<p>Saying, Holy, holy, holy - For the meaning of this, see the notes on <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>.<p>Lord God Almighty - Isaiah Isa 6:3 expresses it, "Yahweh of hosts." The reference is to the true God, and the epithet Almighty is one that is often given him. It is especially appropriate here, as there were to be, as the sequel shows, remarkable exhibitions of power in executing the purposes described in this book.<p>Which was, and is, and is to come - Who is eternal - existing in all past time; existing now; and to continue to exist forever. See the notes on <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. about him&#8212;Greek, "round about him." Alford connects this with the following sentence: "All round and within (their wings) they are (so two oldest manuscripts, A, B, and Vulgate read) full of eyes." John's object is to show that the six wings in each did not interfere with that which he had before declared, namely, that they were "full of eyes before and behind." The eyes were round the outside of each wing, and up the inside of each when half expanded, and of the part of body in that inward recess.<p>rest not&#8212;literally, "have no rest." How awfully different the reason why the worshippers of the beast "have no rest day nor night," namely, "their torment for ever and ever."<p>Holy, holy, holy&#8212;The "tris-hagion" of the Greek liturgies. In Isa 6:3, as here, it occurs; also Ps 99:3, 5, 9, where He is praised as "holy," (1) on account of His majesty (Re 4:1) about to display itself; (2) His justice (Re 4:4) already displaying itself; (3) His mercy (Re 4:6-8) which displayed itself in times past. So here "Holy," as He "who was"; "Holy," as He "who is": "Holy," as He "who is to come." He showed Himself an object of holy worship in the past creation of all things: more fully He shows Himself so in governing all things: He will, in the highest degree, show Himself so in the consummation of all things. "Of (from) Him, through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen." In Isa 6:3 there is added, "the whole EARTH is full of His glory." But in Revelation this is deferred until the glory of THE Lord fills the earth, His enemies having been destroyed [Bengel].<p>Almighty&#8212;answering to "Lord of hosts" (Sabaoth), Isa 6:3.<p>The cherubim here have six wings, like the seraphim in Isa 6:2; whereas the cherubim in Eze 1:6 had four wings each. They are called by the same name, "living creatures." But whereas in Ezekiel each living creature has all four faces, here the four belong severally one to each. See on [2689]Eze 1:6. The four living creatures answer by contrast to the four world powers represented by four beasts. The Fathers identified them with the four Gospels, Matthew the lion, Mark the ox, Luke the man, John the eagle: these symbols, thus viewed, express not the personal character of the Evangelists, but the manifold aspect of Christ in relation to the world (four being the number significant of world-wide extension, for example, the four quarters of the world) presented by them severally: the lion expressing royalty, as Matthew gives prominence to this feature of Christ; the ox, laborious endurance, Christ's prominent characteristic in Mark; man, brotherly sympathy with the whole race of man, Christ's prominent feature in Luke; the eagle, soaring majesty, prominent in John's description of Christ as the Divine Word. But here the context best suits the view which regards the four living creatures as representing the redeemed election-Church in its relation of ministering king-priests to God, and ministers of blessing to the redeemed earth, and the nations on it, and the animal creation, in which man stands at the head of all, the lion at the head of wild beasts, the ox at the head of tame beasts, the eagle at the head of birds and of the creatures of the waters. Compare Re 5:8-10, "Thou hast redeemed us by Thy blood out of every kindred &#8230; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth"; and Re 20:4, the partakers with Christ of the first resurrection, who conjointly with Him reign over the redeemed nations that are in the flesh. Compare as to the happy and willing subjection of the lower animal world, Isa 11:6-8; 65:25; Eze 34:25; Ho 2:18. Jewish tradition says the "four standards" under which Israel encamped in the wilderness, to the east, Judah, to the north, Dan, to the west, Ephraim, to the south, Reuben, were respectively a lion, an eagle, an ox, and a man, while in the midst was the tabernacle containing the Shekinah symbol of the Divine Presence. Thus we have "the picture of that blessed period when&#8212;the earth having been fitted for being the kingdom of the Father&#8212;the court of heaven will be transferred to earth, and the 'tabernacle of God shall be with men' (Re 21:3), and the whole world will be subject to a never-ending theocracy" (compare De Burgh, Exposition of Revelation). The point of union between the two views given above is: Christ is the perfect realization of the ideal of man; Christ is presented in His fourfold aspect in the four Gospels respectively. The redeemed election-Church similarly, when in and through Christ (with whom she shall reign) she realizes the ideal of man, shall combine in herself human perfections having a fourfold aspect: (1) kingly righteousness with hatred of evil and judicial equity, answering to the "lion"; (2) laborious diligence in every duty, the "ox"; (3) human sympathy, the "man"; (4) the contemplation of heavenly truth, the "eagle." As the high-soaring intelligence, the eagle, forms the contrasted complement to practical labor, the ox bound to the soil; so holy judicial vengeance against evil, the lion springing suddenly and terribly on the doomed, forms the contrasted complement to human sympathy, the man. In Isa 6:2 we read, "Each had six wings: with twain he covered his face (in reverence, as not presuming to lift up his face to God), with twain he covered his feet (in humility, as not worthy to stand in God's holy presence), and with twain he did fly [in obedient readiness to do instantly God's command]."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him:</span> the seraphims in Isaiah’s vision, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/6-2.htm" title="And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.">Revelation 6:2</a></span>, had so; there their use is declared, —<span class="ital">with twain he covered his face, with twain his feet, and with twain he did fly.</span> If we understand all the wings here for flight, they signify the readiness of God’s ministers to move every way that God will send them: if we understand them as interpreted by <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.">Isaiah 6:2</a></span>, they signify their various graces, their fear, dread, and reverence of God; their humility and modesty; their agility, or readiness to obey all the commands of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And they were full of eyes within:</span> this denotes that large measure of knowledge, and diligence, and watchfulness, which should be in a minister of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty:</span> this was the song of the seraphims, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a></span>, and shows how much it should be the care of ministers to make God known in all his attributes, his holiness especially, and his power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which was, and is, and is to come; </span> and his eternity and simplicity, as he is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, without variableness or shadow of change. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him,....

The thrice holy Lord God, at the same time, is also the Eternal One <span class="ital">who is to come</span>. These words of praise from the mouth of the four beings agree perfectly with the manifestation of the Enthroned One,[1800] as this itself agrees with his own words;[1801] and in all the living divine, foundation of the entire Apocalyptic prophecy is indicated, because God “comes”—in a personal way, as the prophet says—as surely as he is the Holy, Almighty, Eternal One, endowed with complete living energy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Only now can the question be answered, as to what these beings are, and what their special characteristics signify. Undoubtedly these four <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῶΑ</span></span></span>[1802] are not actual beasts who serve only to support the throne of God, as in Persian and Indian sculptures massive forms of beasts are seen supporting a throne;[1803] for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῶΟΝ</span></span></span> is not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΗΡΊΟΝ</span></span></span>,[1804] and concerning the four beings as <span class="ital">supporting</span> the throne, the text does not say a word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Almost all the explanations of older times depend upon mere surmises, as, that the four beings are meant to designate: the Four Evangelists, and that, too, so that, according to Augustine,[1805] the lion represents Matthew, the man Mark, the ox Luke, and the eagle John;[1806] the four cardinal virtues;[1807] the four mysteries of faith, viz., Christ’s incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension;[1808] the four patriarchal churches;[1809] the four apostles or apostolic men, who were then at Jerusalem as standard-bearers of Christ’s camp;[1810] all the doctors of the Church,[1811] etc. It is further a perversion to regard the four beings as angels, from whom they are expressly distinguished in <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm" title="And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;">Revelation 5:11</a>, <a href="/revelation/7-11.htm" title="And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 7:11</a>.[1812] According to their form, they are essentially identical with the cherubim of the O. T.; so they have also their symbolical meaning. The question is whether they represent <span class="ital">powers</span> of God employed in the creation,[1813] or <span class="ital">creation</span> itself.[1814] The former interpretation is carried to such extent by Ebrard, that the lion is regarded as designating the consuming and destroying, the bullock the nourishing, man the thinking and caring, and the eagle, which soars victoriously above all, the preserving and rejuvenating power in nature. This is indeed ingenious, but is forced. It is in itself peculiar, and entirely unbiblical, to form the <span class="ital">powers</span> of God into definite symbolical beings, and the idea is entirely inadmissible, to regard <span class="ital">powers</span> so formed as proclaiming the praise of God: but, on the other hand, it is perfectly natural for the <span class="ital">works</span> to proclaim the praise of the Creator,[1815] and for these, especially the entire living creation, to be represented by definite, concrete forms. The creatures at the basis of the O. T. cherubic forms most simply offer themselves as such representatives of the entire living creation. The correct point of view is already stated in the rabbinical sentence:[1816] “There are four holding the chief place in the world,—among creatures, man; among birds, the eagle; among cattle, the ox; among beasts, the lion.” That these four are intended to represent the <span class="ital">entire</span> living creation, is indicated by the significant number four itself;[1817] and to object against it, that besides the fish, etc., are not represented, is pointless.[1818] Entirely irrelevant, however, to the proper meaning of the symbol, is the succession of lion, ox, etc., which John, after remodelling in general the Ezekiel cherubic forms, unintentionally changed; the idea also is arbitrary, that the four beings in John, just as in Ezekiel, must have had altogether <span class="ital">human bodies</span>, since man is exalted above other creatures.[1819] This allusion is introduced here without sufficient reason, as the subject has to do simply with the entirety of the living creation as such. Incorrect, besides, is the interpretation of the eyes, wherewith the four beings are covered, by saying that the entire living creation is “spiritualized,”[1820] which follows at least from <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>. The context itself shows, on the other hand, that the eyes are to be regarded as signs of the constant wakefulness day and night, belonging to the ceaseless praise of God.[1821] Finally, the six wings which John has derived for his beings from the six seraphim (Isaiah 6), we cannot well understand here otherwise than as there. They designate not the collective significance of the four beings,[1822] but serve as a figurative representation of the unconditionally dependent and ministerial relation in which the creature stands, and is recognized as standing, to its Creator. Thus Bengel:[1823] “So that with two they covered their faces, with two their feet, and with two flew: whereby then the three chief virtues were indicated, viz., reverence or respect, as they do not boldly look; humility, as they hide themselves before that brilliancy; and obedience, to execute commands.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The essential idea delineated in the images of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῶΑ</span></span></span> (cherubim) may be expressed in words as <a href="/psalms/103-22.htm" title="Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.">Psalm 103:22</a> : “All the works of God (in all places),”—as they, at least with respect to earthly living creatures, are represented in the beings, and that, too, <span class="ital">four</span> beings,—are to “praise God in all places of his dominion.” For, that he, as unconditioned Lord of his creatures, is honored with all humility and obedience, is seen in that they hide themselves, and are ready to serve his will. Yet there is also placed in the mouth of the representatives of the creatures an express ascription of praise to the holy, almighty Lord, and that, too, as the innumerable, ever-wakeful eyes show, one that is perpetual (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>).

And, as in that instance, so this Apocalyptic <span class="greekheb">Τρισάγιον</span> also in the text itself, points out its own meaning in relation to itself:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[60] A has <span class="greekheb">ἔχων</span>: so Lachm. and Tiseh. B, <span class="greekheb">ἔχον</span>. Rec. Text, <span class="greekheb">εἶχον</span>; so Vulg. “habebant.” Either of the former, as being the more difficult, is less likely to have come from transcribers.—E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[61] <span class="greekheb">κυκλόθεν</span>, <span class="ital">about</span>) This is to be referred not to the wings, but to the eyes.—V. g.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[62] So AB Vulg.; but Rec. Text, without good authority, <span class="greekheb">γέμοντα</span>.—E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Holy, He who was:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Holy, He who is:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Holy, He who is to come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He showed Himself as an object of holy worship, in the creation of all things: He shows Himself further more fully as an object of holy worship, in the governing of all things: He will in the highest degree show Himself an object of holy worship, in the consummation of all things. <span class="ital">From Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things: to Him be glory to all ages</span>. Castellio is not inconsistent with those things which we said on the subject of <span class="ital">Holiness</span> in the German Notes; for, according to his explanation, <span class="greekheb">קדוש </span>is Augustus, as T. L. Bunemann observes in the Index of the Bible of Castellio.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In a similar hymn, <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>, there is added, THE EARTH <span class="ital">is full of His glory</span>. But in the Apocalypse this is deferred, until the glory of THE LORD fills <span class="ital">the earth</span>, His enemies having been destroyed. See ch. <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>, <a href="/context/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,...">Revelation 11:16-18</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-2.htm" title="For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.">Revelation 19:2</a>. By the use of which passages, we collect, that the four beasts are more occupied, while the action is in heaven; the elders, while it is extended to the earth.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within.</span> The stop should probably be after wings: <span class="accented">are full of eyes about and within.</span> In <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> we have "six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly." These actions appear to indicate reverence, humility, obedience. The eyes denote ceaseless activity. And they rest not day and night, saying. In the Authorized Version "day and night" is attached to "rest not." but probably should be taken with "saying," for, if connected with the negative phrase, "nor" would be more likely to occur than "and." But the point is practically immaterial, since the sense of the passage is the same in both readings. These representatives of <span class="accented">life</span> display the characteristics of life in its fullest energy. They have no part in anything which savours of death - no stillness, rest, or sleep. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy.</span> The thrice-repeated "holy" has very generally been held to indicate the Trinity of the Godhead. Such is evidently the intention of the English Church in ordering this passage to be read in the Epistle for Trinity Sunday. This ascription of praise is often, though wrongly, spoken of as the "Trisagion." <span class="cmt_word">Lord God Almighty</span>. "Almighty" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, the "All-Ruler," not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the "All-Powerful." The former, as Bishop Pearson says, embraces the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which was, and is, and is to come.</span> This phrase is no doubt intended to attribute to God the quality of eternal existence. But it may also symbolize three aspects or departments of God's dealings with mankind: the <span class="accented">creation</span>, which has been effected by the Father; the <span class="accented">redemption</span>, which is now occurring by the intercession of the Son; and the final perfect <span class="accented">sanctification</span> by the Holy Ghost. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Had (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The best texts read &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; having, the participle in the singular number agreeing with each one.<p>Each of them (&#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;'  &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;)<p>Lit., one by himself.
