The Church of Christ does not always hear the voice of praise from created things.

The ground of praise here is God's eternity, and God's power and glory manifested in the creation of all things for His pleasure. Creation is the foundation of all God's other acts of power, wisdom, and love, and therefore forms the first theme of His creatures' thanksgivings. The four living creatures take the lead of the twenty-four elders, both in this anthem, and in that new song which follows on the ground of their redemption (Re 5:8-10).<p>when&#8212;that is, whensoever: as often as.

The fut., instead of the regular sub.,[1825] does not present a conception that is strictly future,[1826] but has, like the Heb. imperfect, the force of a frequentative: “when, as often as.”[1827]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑΝ ΚΑῚ ΤΙΜῊΝ</span></span></span>.

The ascription of praise to God by the representatives of the creation, viz., the four beasts, is joined by that of the twenty-four elders, the representatives of redeemed humanity;[1824] yet here the praise of the elders (<a href="/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a>) refers not to redemption itself,—which first occurs in <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a> sq.,—but to the power and glory of God revealed in creation, so that the words of the elders stand in beautiful harmony with the praise of the four beings, as well as with the significance of the entire vision; of course not without the relation expressly indicated in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>, and lying at the basis, that Almighty God, who has made the beginning of all things, will also bring them to a completion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1824] Cf. De Wette, Hengstenb., Ebrard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/revelation/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/revelation/4-9.htm" title="And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who lives for ever and ever,">Revelation 4:9</a>. The frequentative meaning of <span class="greekheb">δώσουσι</span> comes from the sense rather than from the grammar of the passage. “Whenever,” etc. (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, throughout the course of this book, <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a> f., <a href="/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 11:16</a> f., <a href="/revelation/19-4.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.">Revelation 19:4</a>) is “a sort of stage-direction” (Simcox). It would be harsh to take the words as a proleptic allusion to the single occurrence at <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a> f. (J. Weiss). To give or ascribe <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> to God is reverently to acknowledge his supreme authority, either spontaneously and gladly (as here and <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7</a>, where “honour” becomes almost “praise”) or under stress of punishment (<a href="/revelation/11-13.htm" title="And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.">Revelation 11:13</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-7.htm" title="Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.">Revelation 14:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/16-9.htm" title="And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which has power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.">Revelation 16:9</a>) and fear of judgment. The addition of <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span> in doxologies amplifies the idea, by slightly emphasising the expression of that veneration and awe felt inwardly by those who recognise his <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. To fear God or to be his servants is thus equivalent upon the part of men to an attitude of pious submission and homage. To “give thanks” is hardly co-ordinate with <span class="greekheb">δ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>., but follows from it as a corollary (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Psalms 96-98). Such worship is the due of <span class="ital">the living God</span> (<a href="/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/10-6.htm" title="And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:">Revelation 10:6</a>, <a href="/revelation/15-7.htm" title="And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.">Revelation 15:7</a>), whereas to eat “meat sacrificed to idols is to worship dead gods” (Did. vi. 3, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm" title="But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.">Revelation 2:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>). The Apocalypse, however, never dwells on the danger of idolatry within the Christian church; its attention is almost absorbed by the supreme idolatry of the Emperor, which is silently contrasted in this and in other passages with the genuine Imperial worship of the Christian church. “He who sits on the throne” (a title of Osiris in <span class="ital">E. B. D.</span>) is the only true recipient of worship. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the hymn to “Ra when he riseth”: “Those who are in thy following sing unto thee with joy and bow down their foreheads to the earth when they meet thee, thou lord of heaven and earth, thou king of Right and Truth, thou creator of eternity”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9, 10</span>. <span class="ital">And when those beasts</span>, &c.] Read <span class="bld">And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanks to Him that sitteth upon the Throne, to Him that liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty elders shall fall down before Him that sitteth …, and shall worship Him …, and shall cast.…”</span> The meaning of the futures is doubtful: some take it as “implying eternal repetition of the act.” Or the meaning may be (if one may say so reverently) a sort of stage direction: “during the future course of the vision, these (who never leave the scene) are to be understood to be thus employed.” But it is always a question in this Book whether the use of tenses be not accommodated to the rules of Hebrew rather than Greek grammar: the sense may after all be merely frequentative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cast their crowns</span>] Alford compares Tac. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> XV. xxix. 3, 6, where Tiridates lays down his crown before the image of Nero, as a token of homage for his kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/revelation/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/context/revelation/4-9.htm" title="And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who lives for ever and ever,...">Revelation 4:9-10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅταν δώσουσι</span>—<span class="greekheb">πεσοῦνται</span>) Each future expresses a simultaneous act of giving of glory on the part of the beasts and on the part of the elders: and, at the same time, it has a frequentative force: <span class="ital">As often as the beasts give glory, immediately the elders fall</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when those beasts give</span>; or, <span class="accented">and as often as the living belongs shall give.</span> The expression has a frequentative force, and also points to a continued repetition of the act in the future; perhaps a contrast to the past, since before the redemption the Church, as being of the whole world, could not join in the adoration. <span class="cmt_word">Glory and honour and thanks</span>.
