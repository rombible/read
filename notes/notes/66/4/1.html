he saw, and lo! the door stood open. There are differences as well as similarities between this vision and others where glimpses into heaven were given to prophets and saints. In Ezekiel’s vision, and in the scene of <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a> (comp, also <a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="/acts/10-11.htm" title="And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:">Acts 10:11</a>) the heavens divide; in this a door stands open. The way into the presence of God lies open (<a href="/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>); all who have faith may enter; in the minds of such the thoughts of the heavenly will mingle with the sorrows of the earthly, and the calm of security will be theirs (<a href="/psalms/46-5.htm" title="God is in the middle of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.">Psalm 46:5</a>). But the scenes of earth’s troubles will always be dispiriting to those who cannot reach the heavenly view-point.<p><span class= "bld">And the first voice </span>(or, <span class= "ital">behold, the first voice) </span><span class= "bld">which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me</span>; (even one) <span class= "bld">which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee </span><span class= "ital">(the)</span> <span class= "bld">things which must be hereafter.—</span>The <span class= "ital">first</span> voice here spoken of is the voice which the Apostle had heard in the opening vision (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>); he heard, and recognised that trumpet-like voice again. It is strange that any should have maintained that this is not the voice of Christ. It is admitted that it must be the same as the voice of <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>; but it is said that the voice of Christ is heard afterwards (<a href="/revelation/1-15.htm" title="And his feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.">Revelation 1:15</a>), not as a trumpet, but as the voice of many waters. The answer is simple; the voice of Christ has many tones; and the voice like a trumpet said, “I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last.” (See <a href="/context/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10-13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a></span>. The former vision which John saw, contained in the foregoing chapters, represented the state of the church at the time when the vision was given, or the things that then were, (<a href="/revelation/1-19.htm" title="Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;">Revelation 1:19</a>,) and gave suitable directions to the churches, with their pastors, to encourage their faith and patience, and excite them to constancy and perseverance. Now the apostle records a second vision, in which the things were revealed to him <span class="ital">that should be afterward, </span>namely, to the end of time: or the things which were to come to pass, in successive order, from the time of the vision till the mystery of God should be finished. In order to raise the greater attention of the church, and to represent the certainty and great importance of the things revealed, both to the glory of God and the salvation of mankind, God himself is represented as seated on his heavenly throne, in the midst of his saints, and the whole general assembly of his church, and the glorious majesty and infinite perfections of God are set forth by very lively, expressive, and beautiful images, together with the high regard which the churches ought always to have for the counsels, designs, and dispensations of divine providence, declared and published in so solemn a manner.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">After this </span>— That is, after I had seen the foregoing vision, and had written as I was directed, the seven letters to the seven churches, from the mouth of Christ; <span class="ital">I looked </span>— Being directed so to do; <span class="ital">and, behold, a door was opened in heaven </span>— So it appeared to me, and hereby I understood that other heavenly discoveries, such as had not been made before, were about to be communicated to me, and that I should obtain a further insight into the divine counsels. Other openings like that here spoken of are successively mentioned. Here <span class="ital">a door is opened; </span>afterward, <span class="ital">the temple of God in heaven, </span><a href="/revelation/11-19.htm" title="And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.">Revelation 11:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-5.htm" title="And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:">Revelation 15:5</a>; and, at last, heaven itself is opened, <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11</a>. By each of these openings, St. John gains a new and more extended prospect. He saw and heard, and then, it seems, immediately wrote down one part after another. By the particle <span class="ital">and </span>the several parts of the prophecy are usually connected: by the expression <span class="ital">after these things, </span>they are distinguished from each other, <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm" title="And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:">Revelation 19:1</a>; and by that expression, <span class="ital">And after these things, </span>they are both distinguished and connected, <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.">Revelation 7:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-5.htm" title="And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:">Revelation 15:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-1.htm" title="And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.">Revelation 18:1</a>. <span class="ital">And the first voice which I heard </span>— Namely, that of Christ, (afterward he heard the voices of many others,) <span class="ital">was as it were of a trumpet talking with me </span>— There may probably be an allusion here to the custom of the Jewish Church, in which, upon opening the gates of the temple, the priests sounded their trumpets to call the Levites and priests to attend to their several offices; <span class="ital">which said, Come up hither </span>— Not in body, but in spirit, which was instantly done; <span class="ital">and I will show thee things which must be hereafter </span>— To such things, then future, the whole subsequent prophecy refers.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 After the Lord Jesus had instructed the apostle to write to the churches the things that are, there was another vision. The apostle saw a throne set in heaven, an emblem of the universal dominion of Jehovah. He saw a glorious One upon the throne, not described by human features, so as to be represented by a likeness or image, but only by his surpassing brightness. These seem emblems of the excellence of the Divine nature, and of God's awful justice. The rainbow is a fit emblem of that covenant of promise which God has made with Christ, as the Head of the church, and with all his people in him. The prevailing colour was a pleasant green, showing the reviving and refreshing nature of the new covenant. Four-and-twenty seats around the throne, were filled with four-and-twenty elders, representing, probably, the whole church of God. Their sitting denotes honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the throne signifies nearness to God, the sight and enjoyment they have of him. They were clothed in white raiment; the imputed righteousness of the saints and their holiness: they had on their heads crowns of gold, signifying the glory they have with him. Lightnings and voices came from the throne; the awful declarations God makes to his church, of his sovereign will and pleasure. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne; the gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the churches of Christ, dispensed according to the will and pleasure of Him who sits upon the throne. In the gospel church, the laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, which cleanses from all sin. In this all must be washed, to be admitted into the gracious presence of God on earth, and his glorious presence in heaven. The apostle saw four living creatures, between the throne and the circle of the elders, standing between God and the people. These seem to signify the true ministers of the gospel, because of their place between God and the people. This also is shown by the description given, denoting wisdom, courage, diligence, and discretion, and the affections by which they mount up toward heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After this - Greek, "After these things"; that is, after what he had seen, and after what he had been directed to record in the preceding chapters. How long after these things this occurred, he does not say - whether on the same day, or at some subsequent time; and conjecture would be useless. The scene, however, is changed. Instead of seeing the Saviour standing before him <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, the scene is transferred to heaven, and he is permitted to look in upon the throne of God, and upon the worshippers there.<p>I looked - Greek, "I saw" -  &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  eidon. Our word "look" would rather indicate purpose or intentions, as if he had designedly directed his attention to heaven, to see what could be discovered there. The meaning, however, is simply that he saw a new vision, without intimating whether there was any design on his part, and without saying how his thoughts came to be directed to heaven.<p>A door was opened - That is, there was apparently an opening in the sky like a door, so that he could look into heaven.<p>In heaven - Or, rather, in the expanse above - in the visible heavens as they appear to spread out over the earth. So <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>, "The heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God." The Hebrews spoke of the sky above as a solid expanse; or as a curtain stretched out; or as an extended arch above the earth - describing it as it appears to the eye. In that expanse, or arch, the stars are set as gems (compare the notes on <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>); through apertures or windows in that expanse the rain comes down, <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; and that is opened when a heavenly messenger comes down to the earth, <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>. Compare <a href="/luke/3-21.htm">Luke 3:21</a>; <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>. Of course, all this is figurative, but it is such language as all people naturally use. The simple meaning here is, that John had a vision of what is in heaven as if there had been such an opening made through the sky, and he had been permitted to look into the world above.<p>And the first voice which I heard - That is, the first sound which he heard was a command to come up and see the glories of that world. He afterward heard other sounds - the sounds of praise; but the first notes that fell on his ear were a direction to come up there and receive a revelation respecting future things. This does not seem to me to mean, as Prof. Stuart, Lord, and others suppose, that he now recognized the voice which had first, or formerly spoken to him <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>, but that this was the first in contradistinction from other voices which he afterward heard. It resembled the former "voice" in this, that it was "like the sound of a trumpet," but besides that there does not seem to have been anything that would suggest to him that it came from the same source. It is certainly possible that the Greek would admit of that interpretation, but it is not the most obvious or probable.<p>Was as it were of a trumpet - It resembled the sound of a trumpet, <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>.<p>Talking with me - As of a trumpet that seemed to speak directly to me.<p>Which said - That is, the voice said.<p>Come up hither - To the place whence the voice seemed to proceed - heaven.<p>And I will show thee things which must be hereafter - Greek, "after these things." The reference is to future events; and the meaning is, that there would be disclosed to him events that were to occur at some future period. There is no intimation here when they would occur, or what would be embraced in the period referred to. All that the words would properly convey would be, that there would be a disclosure of things that were to occur in some future time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>Re 4:1-11. Vision of God's Throne in Heaven; the Four and Twenty Elders; the Four Living Creatures.<p>Here begins the Revelation proper; and first, the fourth and fifth chapters set before us the heavenly scenery of the succeeding visions, and God on His throne, as the covenant God of His Church, the Revealer of them to His apostle through Jesus Christ. The first great portion comprises the opening of the seals and the sounding of the trumpets (fourth to eleventh chapters). As the communication respecting the seven churches opened with a suitable vision of the Lord Jesus as Head of the Church, so the second part opens with a vision suitable to the matter to be revealed. The scene is changed from earth to heaven.<p>1. After this&#8212;Greek, "After these things," marking the opening of the next vision in the succession. Here is the transition from "the things which are" (Re 1:19), the existing state of the seven churches, as a type of the Church in general, in John's time, to "the things which shall be hereafter," namely, in relation to the time when John wrote.<p>I looked&#8212;rather as Greek, "I saw" in vision; not as English Version means, I directed my look that way.<p>was&#8212;Omit, as not being in the Greek.<p>opened&#8212;"standing open"; not as though John saw it in the act of being opened. Compare Eze 1:1; Mt 3:16; Ac 7:56; 10:11. But in those visions the heavens opened, disclosing the visions to those below on earth. Whereas here, heaven, the temple of God, remains closed to those on earth, but John is transported in vision through an open door up into heaven, whence he can see things passing on earth or in heaven, according as the scenes of the several visions require.<p>the first voice which I heard&#8212;the voice which I heard at first, namely, in Re 1:10; the former voice.<p>was as it were&#8212;Omit was, it not being in the Greek. "Behold" governs in sense both "a door," &c., and "the first voice," &c.<p>Come up hither&#8212;through the "open door."<p>be&#8212;come to pass.<p>hereafter&#8212;Greek, "after these things": after the present time (Re 1:19).<span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter....">Revelation 4:1-3</a></span> John seeth the throne of God in heaven,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>,5</span> encompassed with four and twenty elders,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/4-6.htm" title="And before the throne there was a sea of glass like to crystal: and in the middle of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.">Revelation 4:6</a>,7</span> and four beasts full of eyes before and behind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come....">Revelation 4:8-11</a></span> The continual adoration and worship offered by the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>beasts and elders before him that sat on the throne.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">After this; </span> after I had the first vision, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:...">Revelation 1:1-20</a></span>, and had written what it was the pleasure of God I should write to the churches, in a book, perceiving the way God designed to reveal himself to me was by vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I looked; </span> I looked again, hoping and being desirous to see something further as to the mind of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And, behold, a door was opened; </span> I saw the heavens opened, as <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a> <a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In heaven; </span> he, doubtless, meaneth the third heavens.

After John had seen the vision of Christ, in the midst of the golden candlesticks, with seven stars in his right hand; after he was bid to write what he had seen, and what were, and should be hereafter; and after he had by order written the seven epistles to the seven churches, he looked about him to see what else he could, having his desires and expectations raised of seeing more, and other things, for the eye is never satisfied with seeing; though this is to be understood, not of looking with the eyes of his body, but with the eyes of his mind; of his beholding things in a visionary way, as the prophets did, whence they are called "seers", and their prophecies "visions": how long this was after the first vision is not certain, it may be but a few minutes; and it is to be observed, that as the first chapter of this book, with the vision in it, is the preface or introduction to the church prophecy delivered out in the seven epistles; so this and the following chapter, with the vision therein, contain the preface or introduction to the book prophecy exhibited in the opening of the seven seals of the sealed book: <p>and behold, a door was opened in heaven: not in a literal sense, as the heavens were opened at Christ's baptism, and at Stephen's martyrdom, but in a figurative sense; and the phrase is to be understood of a discovery of things that were, or were to be in the church of God, which in this book is oftentimes signified by "heaven": and it must be conceived as done in a visionary way, just as Ezekiel, in the visions of God, was brought to Jerusalem, and the temple there, and in at a door was shown all the abominations committed in the court and temple; so John, in a visionary way, through an opened door, had a scene of things in the church presented to him, as follows: <p>and the first voice which I heard was, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me; this voice is not called the first voice with respect to any other voices that were to follow; but it designs the former voice, the voice that John heard behind him, when he saw the first vision; and this, as that, was clear, loud, and sonorous as a trumpet, so that he thoroughly heard, and rightly understood what was said; it was the same Person that made the following representation of things as did then, even he who is the Alpha and the Omega, the Lord Jesus Christ, the author of the whole revelation; the "first" is left out in the Arabic version: the allusion is to the blowing of trumpets at the opening of the door of the temple; <p>"every day there were one and twenty soundings of a trumpet in the temple, three , "at the opening of the doors", and nine at the daily morning sacrifice, and nine at the daily evening sacrifice (f).'' <p>And one of them was called the great door of the temple; and he that slew the daily sacrifice, did not slay till he heard the sound of that door when it was opened (g); so here at the opening of the door in heaven, in the church, of which the temple was a type, the voice of the Son of God is heard as the sound of a trumpet, talking loudly and familiarly to John: <p>which said, come up hither; from the isle of Patmos, where he was, up to heaven; not into the third heaven, where Paul was caught up, but rather up into the Gospel church, the Jerusalem which is above; though this, as before, is to be understood in a visionary way, in like manner as Ezekiel was lifted up by the Spirit between the earth and the heavens; and so John, in a vision, was called up from Patmos into the air, where he had a representation of the church made unto him: <p>and I will show thee things which must be hereafter; in the world, in the Roman empire, and in the church of God, to the end of the world; not but that there were some things shown him, as before, in the church prophecy, which had been, and were, and which was done to give him a complete view of things from first to last: and these things were shown in the following visions of the seals, trumpets, and vials, and by the Lord Jesus Christ, who talked with him, and to whom this revelation was given to show unto his servants; and it was of things that "must" be, because determined and resolved upon in the unalterable purposes and decrees of God. <p>(f) Misn.

This is divided into two histories: one common to the whole world, till Chapter 9 and another unique to the Church of God, till Chapter 22. These histories are said to be described in several books Re 5:1,10:2. Now this verse is a passage from the former part to this second: where it is said, that heaven was opened, that is, that heavenly things were unlocked and that a trumpet sounded in heaven, to stir up the apostle, and call him to the understanding of things to come. The first history has two parts: one the causes of things done and of this whole revelation in this next chapter, another of the acts done in the next four chapters. The principal causes according to the economy or dispensation of it, are two: One the beginning, which none can approach, that is, God the Father, of whom is spoken in this chapter. The other, the Son, who is the secondary cause, easy to be approached, in that he is God and man in one person; Re 5:5-9.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/revelation/4-1.htm" title="After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.">Revelation 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μετὰ τοῦτα εἰδον</span>.

The phrase indicates a pause, which of course may have covered days as well as hours in the original experience of the seer, if we assume that his visions came in the order in which they are recorded. He is no longer in the island but up at the gates of heaven. In his trance, a heavenly voice comes after he has seen—not heaven opened (the usual apocalyptic and ecstatic symbol, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/acts/10-11.htm" title="And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:">Acts 10:11</a> = a vision, <a href="/revelation/11-5.htm" title="And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.">Revelation 11:5</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.">Ezekiel 1:1</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>, Ap.

Then follows the rapture (which in <a href="/revelation/1-9.htm" title="I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.">Revelation 1:9</a> precedes the voice). The whole vision is composed by a man familiar with O.T. prophecy, in Semitic style: short clauses linked by the monotonous <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, with little or no attempt made at elaboration of any kind. Traits from the theophany of God as a monarch, surrounded by a triple circle (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the triple circle surrounding Ahuramazda), are blended with traits drawn from the theophany in nature. The ordinary Jewish conception (Gfrŏrer, i. 365 f.) tended to regard God as the royal priest, to whom angels rendered ceaseless levitical praise and service (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Revelation 4-5), or as a glorified rabbi whose angels act as interpreters of the heavenly mysteries for man (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Revelation 10 and apocalyptic literature in general with its angelic cicerones).

As in the O.T. the revelation is vouchsafed spontaneously, whereas in Iranian theology (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in the Vendidàd) “it is the wish of man, not the will of God, that is the first cause of the revelation” (Darmesteter, <span class="ital">S. B. E.</span> iv. p. lxxxv.). The seer does not enter the door till he is called; to know the divine will is the outcome of revelation, not of inquiry or speculative curiosity (similar idea in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm" title="But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him.">1 Corinthians 2:9</a> f.). Enoch (xiv. 9 f.) also does not enter the palace of God with its fire-encircled walls, but sees through the open portals “a high throne, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ κρυστάλλινον</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὄρος χερουβίν</span> … and from underneath the great throne came streams of flaming fire so that I could not look thereon.

For the question arises, Whether the event of <span class="ital">the seals</span> began immediately after <span class="ital">the writing</span> of the book, or whether it is still altogether <span class="ital">future?</span> The celebrated D. Lange, besides others, maintains the latter opinion; the former is plainly shown even by the particle, <span class="ital">after these things</span>, repeated in this verse. The former expression (<span class="ital">after these things</span>) connects the vision [with what has preceded], the other connects with the same the result itself. <span class="ital">After these things</span>, that is, after those things, <span class="ital">which</span> ARE, which relate to the seven churches and their angels, <span class="ital">must come to pass</span> the things, which the Lord will now show. The past and the present and the future, <a href="/revelation/1-19.htm" title="Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;">Revelation 1:19</a> (from which verse the expression, <span class="ital">after these things</span>, is here repeated), comprise <span class="ital">the whole</span> of the book which follows: and, as the past and the present are so joined together, that the present, in <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm" title="Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.">Revelation 1:11</a>, <span class="ital">what thou seest</span>, passes into the past, <span class="ital">which thou sawest</span>, <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches.">Revelation 1:20</a>; and again the past, <span class="ital">which thou sawest</span>, passes into the present, <span class="ital">are, are</span>, in the same verse; so the present and the future immediately cohere, without any hiatus, and the connection between the past and the present is only subservient to the connection between the present and the future. Not only is there no trace of delay from the age of John until the last times, but delay is even openly excluded. Future things, the <span class="ital">quick approach</span> of which is evidently declared, <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.">Revelation 22:6</a>, are closely connected with the present by the expression, <span class="ital">after these things</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>D. Lange so explains the particle, <span class="ital">after these things</span>, that, according to the prophetical meaning of the seven epistles, <span class="ital">after</span> the lapse of the same number of periods of the Church, <span class="ital">the seals</span> are completed, etc. Comm. Apoc. f. 62, 73. I reply: I. We have refuted <span class="ital">such</span> a prophetical meaning of the seven epistles, in ch. <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm" title="To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 2:1</a>. II. If the historical meaning of the epistles is preserved, the particle, <span class="ital">after these things</span>, has its limits within the events of the churches in Asia; and this would be the case, even if these churches had a prophetical meaning affixed to them. III. If they were periods, they would not be interrupted by the destruction of the Whore and the Beast, as D. Lange imagines, but they would rather extend beyond the millennium and the short time of the loosing of Satan to the end of the world, together with the time of the Church itself being a wayfarer, the change in the condition of which he also makes too great in the millennium (see below, on ch. <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>), and thus they would run out beyond the seals, and trumpets, and vials. He says, that the CHIEF subject of the Apocalypse is the mystery of <span class="ital">the last</span> times, ch. <a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a>, and following verses. <span class="ital">See Comm. Apoc.</span>, fol. 5; <span class="ital">Hermen. Einl.</span>, p. 27. <span class="ital">It easily happens, that when any truth is gladly received, it is too eagerly declared, and carried beyond its proper limits</span>. Thus this celebrated man takes the millennium for the half-hour during which there was silence in the seventh seal, the former seals being thus very much crowded together, and all the trumpets being accommodated to this: then, having stated his opinion respecting the mystery of the last times, as the <span class="ital">chief</span> subject of the Apocalypse, he presently afterwards assumes, and continually takes it for granted, as though it were <span class="ital">demonstrated</span>: fol. 9, and 11 at the beginning. This is the hinge of the Apocalyptic system made up by this most celebrated commentator. But by such a method that CHIEF point is extended too much. That is no doubt the subject of the Apocalypse, from the passages quoted (since <span class="ital">it is</span> there <span class="ital">set forth</span> as such), thenceforward even to the end of the book: but the very words of the text extend the subject of the preceding chapters to a much wider range than he supposes. In them there is no beast, no whore: it is not until after ch. 10 that they come forth upon the stage, and that too after an interval. Wherefore the beginning of the judgments upon the antichristian enemies ought not to be reckoned from the seals themselves. See this treated at greater length on ch. <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm" title="And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.">Revelation 6:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the same place he so divides the chapters of the Apocalypse, that almost all are deferred to the future. We thus arrange them:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chap. 1. 2. 3. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>contain the Preparation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. 5. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the Proposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6–9. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>are fulfilled, as is shown, without any violence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>10–14. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>are in course of fulfilment, and have been for some time, as is proved by suitable arguments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>15–19. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>exhibit things about to take place shortly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>20–22. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>look to things more distant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whoever has the power, let him subject to the most severe laws of DEMONSTRATION both his treatise and mine.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this</span>; or, <span class="accented">after these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). There is no good ground for supposing, as some do, that, after the events narrated in <a href="/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>, an interval occurred in the visions, during which St. John possibly wrote down the matter contained in the first three chapters. Nor is there any justification for assigning what follows to a time after this world. It would be pressing <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> very far to make it apply to these present things of the world; and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> certainly need not mean "the things after this world." The expression is used here in its ordinary, natural sense: "After having seen this, I saw," etc.; introducing some new phase or variety of spectacle. <span class="cmt_word">I looked</span>; or, <span class="accented">I saw</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). No fresh act of <span class="accented">looking</span> is signified. <span class="accented">I saw in</span> the Spirit, as formerly (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, a door;</span> or, <span class="accented">and, behold, a door, and the first voice.</span> Such is the construction of the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">Was opened in heaven</span>; or, <span class="accented">an open door, in heaven.</span> St. John did not see the action of opening the door, but he saw a door which had been set open, through which he might gaze, and observe what passed within. Alford contrasts <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>, where "the heaven was opened;" and supposes that the seer is transported through the open door into heaven, from which position he sees heaven, and views all that happens on the earth. Victorinus aptly compares the <span class="accented">open door</span> to the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">And the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet talking with me</span>. Omit the "was" which follows, as well as the colon which precedes, and repeat "a voice," as in the Revised Version: <span class="accented">And, behold, an open door in heaven, and the first voice which 1 heard, the voice which was, as it were, of a trumpet.</span> The voice signified is not the <span class="accented">first</span>, but the <span class="accented">former</span> voice; viz. that already heard and described in <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>. The possessor of the voice is not indicated. Stier ('Reden Jesu') attributes the voice to Christ; but it seems rather that of an angel, or at any rate not that of Christ, whose voice in <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a> is described as "of many waters, "not as" of a trumpet." <span class="cmt_word">Which said</span>. The voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) becomes masculine (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>). Though <span class="accented">whose</span> voice is not stated, yet the vividness and reality of the vision causes the writer to speak of the <span class="accented">voice</span> as the personal being whom it signifies. Come up hither. That is in the Spirit - for the apostle "immediately was in the Spirit" (ver. 2). He was to receive a yet higher insight into spiritual things (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, where St. Paul was "caught up into the third heaven"). <span class="cmt_word">And I will show thee</span>. It is not necessary, with Stier (see above on ver. 1), to infer that these words are Christ's. Though from him all the revelation comes, he may well use the ministry of angels through whom to signify his will. <span class="cmt_word">Things which must be hereafter</span>; or, <span class="accented">the things which must happen hereafter.</span> The things which it is right should happen, and which, therefore, must needs happen (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). "Hereafter" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); as before in ver. 1, but in a somewhat more general and less definite sense - at <span class="accented">some time after this</span>; but when precisely is not stated. The full stop may possibly be better placed before "hereafter;" in which case "hereafter" would introduce the following phrase, exactly as before in this verse.
