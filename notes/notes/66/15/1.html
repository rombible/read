In like manner upon the wild beast-power of later ages the plagues of God fall.

As the measure of Babylon's sins was filled up, it finds the full measure of Divine wrath. While believers stand in this world, in times of trouble, as upon a sea of glass mingled with fire, they may look forward to their final deliverance, while new mercies call forth new hymns of praise. The more we know of God's wonderful works, the more we shall praise his greatness as the Lord God Almighty, the Creator and Ruler of all worlds; but his title of Emmanuel, the King of saints, will make him dear to us. Who that considers the power of God's wrath, the value of his favour, or the glory of his holiness, would refuse to fear and honour him alone?

The word "sign" here - &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  se&#772;meion - is the same which in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-13.htm">Revelation 13:13</a>, is rendered "wonder" and "wonders," and in <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>, "miracles." The word is not found elsewhere in the Book of Revelation, though it is of frequent occurrence in other parts of the New Testament. See it explained in the notes on <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>. Here it is used to denote something wonderful or marvelous. This is represented as appearing in heaven, for the judgments that were to fall upon the world were to come thence. Compare <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13-14</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-17.htm">Revelation 14:17</a>.<p>Great and marvelous - Great and wonderful, or suited to excite admiration - &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  thaumaston. The subsequent statements fully justify this, and show that the vision was one of portentous character, and that was suited to hold the mind in astonishment.<p>Seven angels - Compare the notes on <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>.<p>Having the seven last plagues - The article here, "the seven last plagues," would seem to imply that the plagues referred to had been before specified, or that it would be at once understood what is referred to. These plagues, however, have not been mentioned before, and the reason why the article is used here seems to be this: the destruction of this great anti-Christian power had been distinctly mentioned, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. That might be spoken of as a thing now well known, and the mention of it would demand the article; and as that was well known, and would demand the article, so any allusion to it, or description of it, might be spoken of in the same manner, as a thing that was definite and fixed, and hence, the mention of the plagues by which it was to be accomplished would be referred to in the same manner. The word "plagues" - &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;  ple&#772;gas, from, &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;  ple&#772;ge&#772; - means properly a wound caused by a stripe or blow, and is frequently rendered "stripe" and "stripes," <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/16-23.htm">Acts 16:23</a>, <a href="/acts/16-33.htm">Acts 16:33</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-5.htm">2 Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament, except in the Book of Revelation. In this book it is rendered "wound" in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-12.htm">Revelation 13:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; and plagues in <a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-6.htm">Revelation 11:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a>,<a href="/revelation/15-8.htm">Revelation 15:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a>, <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>, <a href="/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18</a>. It does not occur elsewhere. The secondary meaning of the word, and the meaning in the passage before us, is "a stripe" or "blow inflicted by God"; calamity or punishment. The word "last" means those under which the order of things here referred to would terminate; the winding up of the affairs respecting the beast and his image - not necessarily the closing of the affairs of the world. Important events were to occur subsequent to the destruction of this anti-Christian power <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19-22</a>, but these were the plagues which would come finally upon the beast and his image, and which would terminate the existence of this formidable enemy.<p>For in them is filled up the wrath of God - That is, in regard to the beast and his image. All the expressions of the divine indignation toward that oppressive and persecuting power will be completed or exhausted by the pouring out of the contents of these vials. Compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/10-7.htm">Revelation 10:7</a>, where the word rendered "filled up" -  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;  etelesthe&#772; - is rendered "finished." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>Re 15:1-8.

This verse is the summary of the vision that follows: the angels do not actually receive the vials till Re 15:7; but here, in Re 15:1, by anticipation they are spoken of as having them.

This chapter is a preparation to the pouring out of the seven vials, as <a href="/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1</a> is to the sending of the seven epistles, and <a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a> to the seven seals and seven trumpets: the vision is called a "sign", because what was seen was significative of future events; a sign of the coming of Christ, of his kingdom, and of the destruction of antichrist; and it is said to be a sign "in heaven", where John was called up, and where he had his visions; and it was "another", a different one from that in <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1</a> which represented the downfall of Paganism, but this the downfall of Popery; and it is a very "great" one, it is expressive of great things, as the fall of Babylon the great, or the judgment of the great whore, and the great glory of the church and kingdom of Christ; and it is "marvellous", for the two grand events it respects are very wonderful; as that antichrist, who was once in such power, should be destroyed, and that by such weak means, in the esteem of men, as the preaching of the Gospel, which is no less marvellous than the fall of Jericho by the sound of rams' horns; and that the church, which was in so low an estate in the wilderness, for the space of 1260 days or years, should become so glorious. The vision follows, <p>seven angels, having the seven last plagues; these are not the same angels that blew the seven trumpets, for they are not contemporary with them, but are more likely the same with those in the preceding chapter; though they seem rather to be different from them: if these were angels literally understood, their having plagues is no objection to their being good angels, since such are often the executioners of God's wrath; and that these good ones, appears from one of them talking with John, and showing him the judgment of antichrist, and another the bride, the Lamb's wife, and her glory, <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a> though they seem rather to be the ministers of the Gospel, since they are said to come out of the temple, <a href="/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a> and since the destruction of antichrist will be by the breath of Christ's mouth, or by the preaching of the Gospel; unless it should be thought that members of churches are designed, since these angels receive their vials from one of the four living creatures, <a href="/revelation/15-7.htm">Revelation 15:7</a> or preachers of the word; and may denote some very principal men, as kings, who will now be come to Zion, and be members of Gospel churches, and will be the nursing fathers and protectors of them; and these will hate the whore, and burn her flesh with fire; but of these angels, see more on <a href="/revelation/15-6.htm">Revelation 15:6</a>. They are said to have "the seven last plagues"; that is, in their vials; for these seven plagues are the same with the seven vials of the wrath of God, to be poured out upon antichrist; and are no other than so many steps, ways, and means, by which God will bring on and finish his destruction: these are called the last plagues, because they will be in the last days: there have been plagues before, as at the destruction of the old world, and of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the plagues of Egypt, and the downfall of several monarchies and kingdoms, and of Paganism in the Roman empire; but these will fall upon antichrist, and will be the last upon him, for they will issue in his utter ruin; they will be the last plagues upon the earth, there will be no other after them, but the conflagration of the world, and the general destruction of the wicked in hell. These plagues are the same with the third woe, and are an explanation of it, and belong to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, which brings in the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of Christ, and the time of God's wrath upon the nations, or Gentiles, the Papists, and of judging the dead, and destroying them that destroyed the earth, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a> for these plagues do not follow upon the harvest and vintage, nor has this vision any respect to them, nor to be connected with the preceding chapter, but with <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a> and gives an enlarged view, both of the glory of Christ's kingdom, and of the ruin of antichrist, by these plagues, called the last: <p>for in them is filled up the wrath of God; upon the beast, and his followers. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</span><p>(1) This is that other passage of the acts of Christ, as I noted before see Geneva Re 14:14.

Manifestly John wishes, by this expression,[3594] to say more than that they had a sign (“<span class="ital">signatur</span>”) of the plagues to be brought by them, as that possibly their eyes shone like flames of fire;[3595] the idea is, that they who have the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΟΥΣΙΑ</span></span></span> to bring the plagues described in ch. 16.[3596] <span class="ital">have</span> and hold these plagues themselves.

But it is worthy of notice with what beautiful, artistic transparency the declaration of the actual ordination of these plagues is communicated, in that (<a href="/revelation/15-5.htm" title="And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:">Revelation 15:5</a> sqq.) the seven angels, who are described again also in <a href="/revelation/15-6.htm" title="And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.">Revelation 15:6</a> as <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἔχοντες τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑπτὰ πληγ</span>., receive special vials, through the pouring-out of which the plagues can first be brought to plastic representation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From <a href="/revelation/15-5.htm" title="And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:">Revelation 15:5</a>, where the <span class="greekheb">ναός</span> in heaven is opened, and then the seven angels proceed therefrom, Züll., De Wette, Ebrard, etc., correctly infer that in <a href="/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a> a point cannot be designated lying within the vision actually before <a href="/revelation/15-5.htm" title="And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:">Revelation 15:5</a>, as though John in <a href="/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a> had only first beheld the seven angels themselves, but in <a href="/revelation/15-5.htm" title="And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:">Revelation 15:5</a> their coming forth from the <span class="greekheb">ναός</span>, etc.; rather in <a href="/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a>, the chief subject of the entire vision extending to <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm" title="And there fell on men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.">Revelation 16:21</a>, yea in a certain way embracing the entire final development,[3597] is first given preliminarily, while the more detailed account as to how the seven angels actually come forth follows then (<a href="/revelation/15-5.htm" title="And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:">Revelation 15:5</a>) after the heavenly hymn, <a href="/context/revelation/15-2.htm" title="And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God....">Revelation 15:2-4</a>,—during which the angels are to be regarded as in the still closed <span class="greekheb">ναός</span>,—has praised beforehand the righteousness of the judgment to be executed by them; and then they themselves are certainly equipped for (<a href="/revelation/15-7.htm" title="And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.">Revelation 15:7</a>) their work, and directed (<a href="/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>) to fulfil their calling. Cf. <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm" title="And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days.">Revelation 12:6</a> in its relation to <a href="/revelation/12-13.htm" title="And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.">Revelation 12:13</a> sqq.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰς ἐσχάτας</span>. Not “the last in this way,”[3598] nor the last which a certain portion of the enemies has to endure,[3599] but for the reason: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν αὐταῖς ἐτελέσθη ὁ θυμὸς τοῦ θεοῦ</span>.[3600] This is misunderstood, however, by Hengstenb., who concludes that with <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm" title="And there fell on men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.">Revelation 16:21</a>, where the seven plagues are at an end, the entire final judgment has been recounted,—as should have been the case also in <a href="/revelation/11-19.htm" title="And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.">Revelation 11:19</a> and several times before,—and that then, with <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>, a repetition of that final judgment occurs which renders prominent new sides. Yet not only the very number indicates a meaning analogous to that of the seven last plagues, as the plagues described in the seal- and trumpet-visions, which do <span class="ital">not</span> contain the final judgment itself, but have only introduced that immediately before which belongs in the seventh trumpet,[3601] and consequently in the seventh seal;[3602] but, in the sense of the Apoc., the judgment cannot occur at all under the conception of a plague, since, according to the description in ch. 17 sqq., the judgment extends infinitely far over what is contained up to <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm" title="And there fell on men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.">Revelation 16:21</a>. The plagues described also in ch. 16.,[3603] not without a reference to those of Egypt,[3604] have in themselves something preparatory to which the final action corresponds. As by the trumpet-plague the dwellers on earth are not brought to repentance,[3605] so also neither are they by the vial-plagues.[3606] The more certain and immediate, therefore, is the actual final judgment, whose description then also immediately follows that of the <span class="ital">last plagues</span>,[3607] and to which, therefore, we are directed in the midst of the plagues as to something immediately impending.[3608] The result of this is that the <span class="ital">fulfilment of the wrath of God</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐτελέσθη</span>)[3609] is to be understood only relatively; viz., in so far as it is manifested in the “plagues.” No more plagues will come after the vial-plagues; but then the Lord himself will come to administer his final judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3593] Züll., Stern; cf. also De Wette.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3594] Cf. <a href="/revelation/17-6.htm" title="And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.">Revelation 17:6</a>, <a href="/revelation/6-5.htm" title="And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see.
