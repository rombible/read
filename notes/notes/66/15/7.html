These vials are given by one of the living creatures who represent creation; it is thus through creation that the wrath of God can visit the rebellious; that wrath of God is simply the operation of God’s righteous law against sin. His statutes are eternally righteous. He has given to all things a law which cannot be broken; that law is adverse to evil, and will in the end root it out, for it does the bidding of God, who lives unto the ages of the ages.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:5-8 In the judgments God executes upon antichrist and his followers, he fulfils the prophecies and promises of his word. These angels are prepared for their work, clothed with pure and white linen, their breasts girded with golden girdles, representing the holiness, and righteousness, and excellence of these dealings with men. They are ministers of Divine justice, and do every thing in a pure and holy manner. They were armed with the wrath of God against his enemies. Even the meanest creature, when armed with the anger of God, will be too hard for any man in the world. The angels received the vials from one of the four living creatures, one of the ministers of the true church, as in answer to the prayers of the ministers and people of God. Antichrist could not be destroyed without a great shock to all the world, and even the people of God would be in trouble and confusion while the great work was doing. The greatest deliverances of the church are brought about by awful and astonishing steps of Providence; and the happy state of the true church will not begin till obstinate enemies shall be destroyed, and lukewarm or formal Christians are purified. Then, whatever is against Scripture being purged away, the whole church shall be spiritual, and the whole being brought to purity, unity, and spirituality, shall be firmly established.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And one of the four beasts - See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-7</a>. Which one of the four is not mentioned. From the explanation given of the design of the representation of the "four beasts," or living creatures, in the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-7</a>, it would seem that the meaning here is, that the great principles of that divine government would be illustrated in the events which are now to occur. In events that were so closely connected with the honor of God and the triumph of his cause on the earth, there was a propriety in the representation that these living creatures, symbolizing the great principles of divine administration, would be particularly interested.<p>Gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials - The word used here - &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;  phiale&#772; - means properly, "a bowl or goblet, having more breadth than depth" (Robinson, Lexicon). Our word vial, though derived from this, means rather a thin long bottle of glass, used particularly by apothecaries and druggists. The word would be better rendered by "bowl" or "goblet," and probably the representation here was of such bowls as were used in the temple service. See the notes on <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>. They are called in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1</a>, "vials of the wrath of God"; and here they are said to be "full of the wrath of God." The allusion seems to be to a drinking cup or goblet filled with poison, and given to persons to drink - an allusion drawn from one of the methods of punishment in ancient times. See the notes on <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>. These vials or goblets thus became emblems of divine wrath, to be inflicted on the beast and his image.<p>Full of the wrath of God - Filled with what represented his wrath; that is, they seemed to be filled with a poisonous mixture, which being poured upon the earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun, the seat of the beast, the river Euphrates, and into the air, was followed by severe divine judgments on this great anti-Christian power. See <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2-4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-8.htm">Revelation 16:8</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-10.htm">Revelation 16:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a>.<p>Who liveth forever and ever - The eternal God. The particular object in referring to this attribute here appears to be, that though there may seem to be delay in the execution of his purposes, yet they will be certainly accomplished, as he is the ever-living and unchangeable God. He is not under a necessity of abandoning his purposes, like people, if they are not soon accomplished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. one of the four beasts&#8212;Greek, "living creatures."

Or living creatures: now we hear of them, as of the four and twenty elders, under the blowing of the seventh trumpet, <a href="/revelation/11-16.htm">Revelation 11:16</a> with which this vision is contemporary; these living creatures are the ministers of the Gospel; See Gill on <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a> and this was one, or the first of them, who was like a lion, for fortitude and courage, and whose voice was as the noise of thunder, <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a> and so fitly represents those ministers who shall give out the vials of God's wrath: not any particular person is designed, who shall be at this time; and much less Luke the evangelist, as Lord Napier thinks; nor Peter, who prophesied of the last time, <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a> as Grotius; but a set of Gospel ministers, comparable to one of the living creatures John had before seen; of whom it is said, that they <p>gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever: these seven vials are for the seven last plagues to be put into, and out of which they are to be taken, or poured, and inflicted; see <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a> hence it appears, that the seven plagues, and the wrath of God, are the same thing, and both design God's judgments upon antichrist; and these being expressed by "vials", which are measures, and large ones, show the large abundance and plenteous effusion of God's wrath, and the secret, sudden, and irresistible power of it; and yet that it will be poured out in measure, according to righteous judgment, and therefore it is put into vials; and these golden ones, expressive of the purity, holiness, and justice of the divine proceedings: and it will be very terrible; it will be, not the wrath of men, but of God, and a cup of the fierceness of his wrath; it will be the wrath of the living God, of him that lives for ever, and as he is, such will his wrath be; it will continue for ever, for this wrath will issue in the everlasting destruction of antichrist: so the wrath of God is signified by a wine cup of fury, <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a> and that destruction, and those plagues which God designed to bring upon Pharaoh, are by Jonathan ben Uzziel, in his Targum on <a href="/genesis/40-12.htm">Genesis 40:12</a> called  "a vial of wrath", which he should drink of: and in the pouring out of there seven vials, there is in some of them a manifest allusion to the plagues of Egypt. So the cup of trembling, in <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a> is by the Targumists called  "a vial", and also "the cup of fury", <a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm">Isaiah 51:22</a> and that these vials were not small narrow mouthed vessels, but large broad mouthed ones, and more properly basins or bowls, is manifest from the use of the word with Jewish writers. The dishes on which the loaves of the shewbread were set, each of which loaves was ten hands breadth long, and five broad (q), are by the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem on <a href="/exodus/25-29.htm">Exodus 25:29</a> called  "vials"; and so the chargers offered at the dedication of the tabernacle, <a href="/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13</a> are, by the same, rendered vials, which weighed 130 shekels; and so the silver bowl they offered, is, by Josephus (r), called a vial: the bowls in <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a> are, by the Targum there, said to be "silver vials". The lordly dish brought by Jael to Sisera, <a href="/judges/5-25.htm">Judges 5:25</a> the Targum calls the vial of the mighty ones; and the earthen vessels used at the trial of the suspected wife, and at the cleansing of the leper, are both by Jewish writers said to be "vials" (s). Now these vials were given to the seven angels by one of the living creatures, the ministers of the word; from whence it seems that these angels design members of churches, as distinct from ministers; and may intend civil magistrates, and very principal ones, as kings of the earth, who, in this state of things, and times, will belong to the churches, and will be the instruments of destroying antichrist: and these vials may be said to be given to them by the ministers, since they will execute this vengeance in consequence of their prayers, and the churches', called vials full of odours, <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a> and because these great men will be stirred up by the ministers of the Gospel, and by their ministrations, to do this work; see <a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>. <p>(q) Misn.
