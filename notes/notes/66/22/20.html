And while we are busy in the duties of our different stations of life; whatever labours may try us, whatever difficulties may surround us, whatever sorrows may press us down, let us with pleasure hear our Lord proclaiming, Behold, I come quickly; I come to put an end to the labour and suffering of my servants. I come, and my reward of grace is with me, to recompense, with royal bounty, every work of faith and labour of love. I come to receive my faithful, persevering people to myself, to dwell for ever in that blissful world. Amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus. A blessing closes the whole. By the grace of Christ we must be kept in joyful expectation of his glory, fitted for it, and preserved to it; and his glorious appearance will be joyful to those who partake of his grace and favour here. Let all add, Amen. Let us earnestly thirst after greater measures of the gracious influences of the blessed Jesus in our souls, and his gracious presence with us, till glory has made perfect his grace toward us. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He which testifieth these things - The Lord Jesus; for he it was that had, through the instrumentality of the angel, borne this solemn witness to the truth of these things, and this book was to be regarded as his revelation to mankind. See the notes on <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>. He here speaks of himself, and vouches for the truth and reality of these things by saying that he "testifies" of them, or bears witness to them. Compare <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>. The fact that Jesus himself vouches for the truth of what is here revealed, shows the propriety of what John had said in the previous verses about adding to it, or taking from it.<p>Saith, Surely I come quickly - That is, the development of these events will soon begin - though their consummation may extend into far distant ages, or into eternity. See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>.<p>Amen - A word of solemn affirmation or assent. See the notes on <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>. Here it is to be regarded as the expression of John, signifying his solemn and cheerful assent to what the Saviour had said, that he would come quickly. It is the utterance of a strong desire that it might be so. He longed for his appearing.<p>Even so - These, too, are the words of John, and are a response to what the Saviour had just said. In the original, it is a response in the same language which the Saviour had used, and the beauty of the passage is marred by the translation "Even so." The original is, "He which testifieth to these things saith, Yea - &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  nai - I come quickly. Amen. Yea - &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  nai - come, Lord Jesus." It is the utterance of desire in the precise language which the Saviour had used - heart responding to heart.<p>Come, Lord Jesus - That is, as here intended, "Come in the manner and for the objects referred to in this book." The language, however, is expressive of the feeling of piety in a more extended sense, and may be used to denote a desire that the Lord Jesus would come in any and every manner; that he would come to impart to us the tokens of his presence; that he would come to bless his truth and to revive his work in the churches; that he would come to convert sinners, and to build up his people in holiness; that he would come to sustain us in affliction, and to defend us in temptation; that he would come to put a period to idolatry, superstition, and error, and to extend the knowledge of his truth in the world; that he would come to set up his kingdom on the earth, and to rule in the hearts of people; that he would come to receive us to his presence, and to gather his redeemed people into his everlasting kingdom. It was appropriate to the aged John, suffering exile in a lonely island, to pray that the Lord Jesus would speedily come to take him to himself; and there could have been no more suitable close of this marvelous book than the utterance of such a desire. And it is appropriate for us as we finish its contemplation, disclosing so much of the glories of the heavenly world, and the blessedness of the redeemed in their final state, when we think of the earth, with its sorrows, trials, and cares, to respond to the prayer, and to say, "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly." For that glorious coming of the Son of God, when he shall gather his redeemed people to himself, may all who read these notes be finally prepared. Amen. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Amen. Even so, come&#8212;The Song of Solomon (So 8:14) closes with the same yearning prayer for Christ's coming. A, B, and Aleph omit "Even so," Greek, "nai": then translate for Amen, "So be it, come, Lord Jesus"; joining the "Amen," or "So be it," not with Christ's saying (for He calls Himself the "Amen" at the beginning of sentences, rather than puts it as a confirmation at the end), but with John's reply. Christ's "I come," and John's "Come," are almost coincident in time; so truly does the believer reflect the mind of his Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/revelation/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/revelation/22-13.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.">Revelation 22:13</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He which testifieth these things,....

John next puts his <p>Amen to it, signifying his assent unto it, declaring his faith in it, and expressing his earnest desire after it, and wish for it: and in words at length adds, <p>even so come, Lord Jesus; quickly, speedily as thou hast said, and in all thy glory; set up thy kingdom, let that come, introduce thy people into it, and destroy thine enemies; this he said as one that loved the appearance of Christ, longed for it, hastened to it, and was impatient at the delay of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
