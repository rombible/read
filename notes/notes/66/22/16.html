He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I Jesus - Here the Saviour appears expressly as the speaker - ratifying and confirming all that had been communicated by the instrumentality of the angel.<p>Have sent mine angel - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>.<p>To testify unto you - That is, to be a witness for me in communicating these things to you.<p>In the churches - Directly and immediately to the seven churches in Asia Minor <a href="/revelation/2-3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>; remotely and ultimately to all churches to the end of time. Compare the notes on <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>.<p>I am the root - Not the root in the sense that David sprang from him, as a tree does from a root, but in the sense that he was the "root-shoot" of David, or that he himself sprang from him, as a sprout starts up from a decayed and fallen tree - as of the oak, the willow, the chestnut, etc. See this explained in the notes on <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. The meaning then is, not that he was the ancestor of David, or that David sprang from him, but that he was the offspring of David, according to the promise in the Scripture, that the Messiah should be descended from him. No argument, then, can be derived from this passage in proof of the pre-existence, or the divinity of Christ.<p>And the offspring - The descendant; the progeny of David; "the seed of David according to the flesh." See the notes on <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>. It is not unusual to employ two words in close connection to express the same idea with some slight shade of difference.<p>And the bright and morning star - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>. It is not uncommon to compare a prince, a leader, a teacher, with that bright and beautiful star which at some seasons of the year precedes the rising of the sun, and leads on the day. Compare the notes on <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>. The reference here is to that star as the harbinger of day; and the meaning of the Saviour is, that he sustains a relation to a dark world similar to this beautiful star. At one time he is indeed compared with the sun itself in giving light to the world; here he is compared with that morning star rather with reference to its beauty than its light. May it not also have been one object in this comparison to lead us, when we look on that star, to think of the Saviour? It is perhaps the most beautiful object in nature; it succeeds the darkness of the night; it brings on the day - and as it mingles with the first rays of the morning, it seems to be so joyous, cheerful, exulting, bright, that nothing can be better adapted to remind us of Him who came to lead on eternal day. Its place - the first thing that arrests the eye in the morning - might serve to remind us that the Saviour should be the first object that should draw the eye and the heart on the return of each day. In each trial - each scene of sorrow - let us think of the bright star of the morning as it rises on the darkness of the night - emblem of the Saviour rising on our sorrow and our gloom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. mine angel&#8212;for Jesus is Lord of the angels.<p>unto you&#8212;ministers and people in the seven representative churches, and, through you, to testify to Christians of all times and places.<p>root &#8230; offspring of David&#8212;appropriate title here where assuring His Church of "the sure mercies of David," secured to Israel first, and through Israel to the Gentiles.

As John, the writer of this book, sets down his own name, who was an eye and ear witness of the things contained in it, that they might be more surely believed, <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8</a> so Christ, the author of it, puts his name Jesus to it, to engage the greater attention to hear and read, and keep the words of it, as well as to make it plain and manifest, who is the person speaking of his coming, <a href="/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7</a> and who that has any value for Jesus the Saviour, but will give credit, and pay a regard to this revelation of his, which he sent by his angel, one of his ministering spirits, made by him, and under his command, he being the Creator, Lord, and head of angels: this expresses the dignity of his person, and is no inconsiderable proof of his deity: and this was done, in order <p>to testify, to bear witness to the truth of the things contained in it; to signify and show them, to set them forth in emblems and visions: <p>unto you these things in the churches; to the servants of the Lord, <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm">Revelation 22:6</a> to John, and by him to others, to the pastors of the seven churches, who were  "over" the churches, as it may be rendered, and to the members of the churches, to all that were in them; for the Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions read  "in"; the Syriac version renders it,  "before the churches". What John saw he wrote in a book, and sent it to these churches, <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>. The words may be rendered, "concerning the churches"; and then the sense is, that the angel was sent to show to John, and by him to others, even to all the saints in all ages, the things relating to the church of Christ, in the several periods of time, represented in succession by the seven churches of Asia. Christ gives a further account of himself, for the greater confirmation of the faith of his people, in the certain accomplishment of the things herein written, by saying, <p>I am the root and the offspring of David. The former of these is mentioned in the note; see Gill on <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>; and the meaning of it is, either that Christ, as God, is David's Lord and head, from whom he had his being, both in a temporal and spiritual sense, and by whom he was supported and sustained; or that, as man, he sprung from the root of David, or descended from him; and so it falls in with the latter, which may be explanative of it, "the offspring of David"; that is, the soft of David, according to the flesh, a frequent name of the Messiah; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. God promised that the Messiah should be of the seed of David, and according to his promise he raised up unto Israel of his seed, a Saviour Jesus, the same person here speaking, <a href="/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a> who adds, <p>and the bright and morning star; Christ is compared to a "star", as in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a> for its light, the light of nature, and of grace, and of the new Jerusalem state being from him; and for its glory, his glory being the glory of the only begotten of the Father, and he having a glory, as Mediator, which his saints will ever behold, and be delighted with; and for its influence, all the blessings of grace, life, and righteousness, being from him; and to a "bright" star, because he is the brightness of his Father's glory, and so splendid, shining, and illustrious, that he is light itself, and in him is no darkness at all; and to a bright "morning" star, which shows the night is going off and the day is coming on, and is the phosphorus, or bringer of light; as Christ by his first coming, who was then the dayspring from on high, put an end to the night of Jewish darkness, and sprung the great Gospel day, so often spoken of by the prophets, and brought life and immortality to light by the Gospel, and showed the way to eternal life by himself; so by his second coming, to which this character refers, he will put an end to the night of antichristian darkness, Pagan, Papal, and Mahometan; so that there shall be no more night, and shall make an everlasting day, and bring such light into the holy city, that it shall need no candle, nor light of the sun or moon. The dawn of light at the Reformation was a presage of this, <a href="/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a> called there the morning star. With great propriety and pertinence are these titles here assumed by Christ, as "the root and offspring of David", or David's son, when he was about to sit on the throne of his father David, and possess his kingdom in the most visible and glorious manner; and "the bright and morning star", when he was going to usher in such light into the new Jerusalem, as would make all other light unnecessary. Aijeleth Shahar, in the title of <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a> which is a psalm that belongs to the Messiah, is, by some Jewish writers (l), interpreted, , "the morning star", the title of Christ here. <p>(l) Apud Kimchi in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.

But while any Jewish Christian sources may have been drawn from this quarter, the final authorship and authority is claimed by (or, for) John himself (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a>).—<span class="greekheb">Δαυείδ</span>. Like most early Christians, John attached more weight to the Davidic descent of Jesus as messiah (Baldensperger, 82 f.), than Jesus himself allowed. Here Christ’s authority in revelation is bound up with his legitimate claim to be messiah, and thus to inaugurate the new and eternal day of God. As <span class="greekheb">ἀνατολή</span> (the dawn = <span class="greekheb">צֶמַח</span>) was already a messianic symbol, and employed in LXX (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, <a href="/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>) to denote the messianic branch or stem, this double usage explains the imagery here (so Justin, <span class="ital">Apol.</span> i. 32). Jesus has not only the historic preparation of Israel behind him but the infinite future before him. In one sense he was the climax of Hebrew expectation; in another, he is of world-wide significance. In connexion with the heavenly Jerusalem it was natural that Jesus should be hailed as the scion of the David who had founded the first Jerusalem. The star-metaphor reflects the significance of the morning-star which meant the beginning of a new day for toilers in the Levant; but its eschatological outlook was taken ultimately from Babylonian astro-theology, where Nebo-Mercury (nebî = prophet), the morning-star, announced the new era, or from Egyptian theology where (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="ital">E. B. D.</span> p. cxliii.) Pepi the dead king “goeth forth into heaven among the Stars which never perish, and his guide the Morning-Star leadeth him to Sekhet-Hetep [the fields of peace]”. The phraselogy brings out the conviction of the early church that the present trial was only the cold, dark hour before the dawn. Their faith in Jesus assured them that an eternal prospect of bliss awaited them, and that this vista of hope was hound up with the person of the risen Jesus (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.">Revelation 22:13</a>). The watchword was, sunrise and morning-star (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="ital">Expos.</span> Dec. 1902, 424–441). Christianity was not some ephemeral Oriental cult, which had had its day; the cosmic overthrow meant a new era for its adherents. The Apocalypse thus closes, as it began (<a href="/context/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,...">Revelation 1:5-6</a>) with a note of ringing emphasis upon the eternal significance of Christ in the divine plan and purpose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/revelation/22-13.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.">Revelation 22:13</a> Gathers up the double thought of 16 and of 12.

Whether He is <span class="ital">personally</span> present, however, is doubtful: the words are His, but it is probably still the angel that speaks them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mine angel</span>] Would our Lord say this of any angel of the Lord, because “all things that the Father hath are His.” Or has our Lord, as Man, an angel of His own in the same way that His saints have? St <a href="/luke/22-43.htm" title="And there appeared an angel to him from heaven, strengthening him.">Luke 22:43</a> seems as if He needed and had, in the days of His flesh, such angelic guardianship as is implied in St <a href="/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a> : and this passage is at least consistent with the view, that His angel appears in His form, as St Peter’s was supposed to do, <a href="/acts/12-15.htm" title="And they said to her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.">Acts 12:15</a>. It is very ably argued by St Augustine (<span class="ital">de Cura pro Mortuis</span>), that if any apparitions after death or at the moment of death are really objective and supernatural, they must be ascribed to angels, not to the spirits of the dead. But we must remember that our Lord’s state is not the same as that of His departed servants. He is already in the body of the Resurrection, and so conceivably visible. And there can be no doubt that He appeared in His own risen body to St Paul, and probably to St Stephen. It may be, therefore, that He now appears personally to St John, at once superseding and authenticating the previous ministry of the angel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the root and the offspring of David</span>] He bears the former title in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm" title="And one of the elders said to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.">Revelation 5:5</a>, where see note. The latter is substantially the same as the familiar one, “the Son of David.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and <span class="ital">the bright and morning star</span>] Both “and”s should be omitted.

Dusterdieck, Hengstenberg, and others would translate, "concerning the Churches." <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, "in," is found in A and some other manuscripts. Some cursives omit the preposition entirely.

(On "Root," see on Revelation 5:5; for "Morning Star," cf. <a href="/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>.) At the word "David," the manuscript 1, from which Erasmus compiled the Textus Receptus, ends. In order to supply the remainder, which is deficient, Erasmus retranslated the Vulgate Version into Greek. The Greek, therefore, of the Textus Receptus from this point onwards is the Greek of Erasmus. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The root<p>Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>.
