He is the Lord God faithful and true. Also by his messengers; the holy angels showed them to holy men of God. They are things that must shortly be done; Christ will come quickly, and put all things out of doubt. And by the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's interpreter. He refused to accept religious worship from John, and reproved him for offering it. This presents another testimony against idolatrous worship of saints and angels. God calls every one to witness to the declarations here made. This book, thus kept open, will have effect upon men; the filthy and unjust will be more so, but it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those who are upright with God. Never let us think that a dead or disobedient faith will save us, for the First and the Last has declared that those alone are blessed who do his commandments. It is a book that shuts out form heaven all wicked and unrighteous persons, particularly those who love and make lies, therefore cannot itself be a lie. There is no middle place or condition. Jesus, who is the Spirit of prophecy, has given his churches this morning-light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of the perfect day approaching. All is confirmed by an open and general invitation to mankind, to come and partake freely of the promises and of the privileges of the gospel. The Spirit, by the sacred word, and by convictions and influence in the sinner's conscience, says, Come to Christ for salvation; and the bride, or the whole church, on earth and in heaven, says, Come and share our happiness. Lest any should hesitate, it is added, Let whosoever will, or, is willing, come and take of the water of life freely. May every one who hears or reads these words, desire at once to accept the gracious invitation. All are condemned who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by adding to it, or taking from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>.<p>For I am thy fellow-servant - notes on <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>.<p>And of thy brethren the prophets - In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>, it is "of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus."

Unlike Nebo, the angelic interpreter of Marduk’s will in Babylonian religion, he is not to be worshipped, for all his importance. Precautions against angel-worship could hardly be more stringent. “The repetition of the scene is enough to show that it does not represent a natural ebullition of feeling and its corretction, but that the narrative has a purpose … and that those who observed the practice made use of” John’s name, or at any rate believed they could appeal to him as sanctioning their superstition (Weizäcker, ii. 203–204).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">for</span>] should be omitted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy brethren the prophets</span>] It has been recognised in <span class="ital"><a href="/context/revelation/22-6.htm" title="And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done....">Revelation 22:6-7</a></span>, that St John is a prophet, and shares in the special blessedness given to prophets.

In the latter case, also, there is little difference of meaning, since the "sayings of this book" are exhortations to a faithful bearing of "the testimony of Jesus;" those, therefore, "who keep" (that is, carry out) "the sayings" are those who "hold the testimony of Jesus." "The prophets" need not be restricted in meaning to either Old or New Testament prophets, but may include both. The direct inspiration of the message which St. John has to deliver is here asserted.
