There is perhaps allusion in the present passage to this wilderness encampment, and to the re-adjustment of the order of the tribes in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 48); but there is more than order here: the gates lie open to all quarters; there is no refusal of admission to any people.

Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And had a wall great and high - Ancient cities were always surrounded with walls for protection, and John represents this as enclosed in the usual manner. The word "great" means that it was thick and strong. Its height also is particularly noticed, for it was unusual. See <a href="/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>.<p>And had twelve gates - Three on each side. The number of the gates correspond to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and to the number of the apostles. The idea seems to be that there would be ample opportunity of access and egress.<p>And at the gates twelve angels - Stationed there as guards to the New Jerusalem. Their business seems to have been to watch the gates that nothing improper should enter; that the great enemy should not make an insidious approach to this city as he did to the earthly paradise.<p>And names written thereon - On the gates.<p>Which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel - So in the city which Ezekiel saw in vision, which John seems also to have had in his eye. See <a href="/ezekiel/48-31.htm">Ezekiel 48:31</a>. The inscription in Ezekiel denoted that that was the residence of the people of God; and the same idea is denoted here. The New Jerusalem is the eternal residence of the children of God, and this is indicated at every gate.

The church is said to have twelve gates, because of the free liberty of access to the church while it was militant, and to signify that the church in heaven will be made up of persons come into it from all parts; or for the greater state and glory of it.

It is very observable, how God affects the number of twelve in the affairs of his church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And had a wall great and high,.... Not the Spirit of God, who separates, sanctifies, and preserves the saints, as Cocceius thinks, for this account respects not the church militant; nor the eternal decree of God, the unpassable gulf between heaven and hell, which everlastingly fixes the state of men; for this regards not the ultimate state of happiness: many interpreters understand it of the doctrine of the Gospel, which, as it secures the church now from heretics, and is like a wall very strong and well built, is durable and impregnable; and may be called "great", because of the great Author of it, and the great things contained in it; and "high", since it is not to be reached by carnal minds; so none but such who have embraced it shall enter into the new Jerusalem; for all liars, and forgers of doctrinal lies, and who embrace the antichristian lies, shall be without. Though rather the almighty power of God, which guards his church and people now, and will be their defence in this state, is meant; and which shows the state not to be that of the ultimate glory, which will need no wall, but this will; since an attempt will be made upon the saints in it, though it will be a foolish and fruitless one: and this wall of divine power is very great indeed, and is insuperable by men; God himself is a wall of fire about his people; though it may be best to interpret this of salvation itself, which is by Jesus Christ, if we compare with this text <a href="/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a> for those, and those only, who are interested in it, will dwell in the new Jerusalem; and salvation in this state will be enjoyed in its fulness; and this is very great in its author, objects, and matter, being wrought out by the great God, for great sinners, at a great expense, and including grace and glory, and not to be got over or enjoyed by those who have no interest in it. <p>And had twelve gates; though, strictly speaking, there is but one gate, and that a strait one, which is the Lord Jesus Christ, his person, blood, righteousness, regenerating and sanctifying grace; for as he is the only door into the sheepfold, the church, in its present state, or he only that has faith in him has a right to enter there, and is the only way to heaven and eternal happiness; so he is the only gate into the new Jerusalem, or such only will be admitted there, who are interested in him: but these gates are said to be twelve, in allusion to the twelve apostles, who pointed out to men the way of salvation by Christ; and to the twelve tribes of Israel, who represent all the elect of God, who enter in thereat; and to the twelve gates of Ezekiel's city, <a href="/ezekiel/48-31.htm">Ezekiel 48:31</a>. <p>And at the gates twelve angels; meaning either the ministering spirits, in allusion to the cherubim in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> who are watchers, and encamp about the saints now, and will, as it were, stand sentinels in this camp of the saints, as it is called, <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a> and besides, will be made use of in gathering the saints from the several parts of the world, and introducing them into this state; or else the apostles and ministers of the word, often called angels in this book, who will shine with peculiar lustre now, and will appear at the head of the several companies they have been useful to, and bring them as their joy and crown of rejoicing into this glorious state: this clause is wanting in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Syriac version.

In like manner the Jews (g) make mention of a court of the Lord, <p>"which has twelve gates, according to the computation of the tribes of Israel; on one gate is written Reuben, on another is written Simeon; and so all the tribes of Israel are written on those gates; in the time they go up to appear before the Lord of the world, whoever goes up to this gate, (on which the tribe of Reuben is written,) if he is of the tribe of Reuben they open to him, (and receive him,) if not they cast him without; and so of all whom they do not receive; they open to none but to him who is of that tribe, or whose name is written on the gate.'' <p>(f) Raziel, fol. 35. 2.((g) Zohar in Numb. fol. 70. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/revelation/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> And had a wall great and high, <i>and</i> had <span class="cverse3">{10}</span> twelve gates, and at the gates <span class="cverse3">{11}</span> twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are <i>the names</i> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</span><p>(9) A particular description of the celestial Church, first, by its essential parts, compared to a city down to verse 22, Re 21:12-22.

Correctly, Bengel: “They keep watch, and serve as an ornament.

If, even in the new Jerusalem, they are the foundation on which the security of the Church against all conceivable dangers depends, they must also be the bulwark through all periods of the Church militant. But this passage, and that of <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>, where the twelve apostles appear in the ‘regeneration,’—the new Jerusalem,—as the heads of the Church, are a sufficient answer to those who maintain that the apostolate is a continuous institution, and expect salvation for the Church by subjection to pretended new apostles. The Lord himself, and the disciple whom he loved, knew only of <span class="ital">twelve</span> apostles. The twelve apostles are forever. That in the corner-stone, besides the apostles, there are also prophets, is only a seeming variation. For that the prophets are not those of the O. T., but of the N. T., and personally identical with the apostles, is clear from the parallel passages <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm" title="He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.">Revelation 3:5</a>, <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/revelation/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><span class="greekheb">ἔχουσα</span>.

A writer who could compose, or incorporate, or retain (as we choose to put it), passages like <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a> and <a href="/revelation/14-4.htm" title="These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.
