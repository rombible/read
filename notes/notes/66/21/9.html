and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>).—Before entering upon this section it is wise to recall once more that the descriptions here given are figurative, and are not to be understood literally. “There is nothing in it as it seems saving the King.” This remark may well be thought needless; but the misconceptions and misrepresentations of the Christian’s hope have been many and reckless; and, even were this not the case, there is always a certain proportion of people who seem incapable of understanding figurative language. Half the errors of the Church have been due to prosaic-minded men who could not discern the difference between figure and fact; and men of unpoetical and vehement temperament have blundered over these descriptions, and their blunders have discredited the whole Apocalypse in the eyes of some. The following are the features of the heavenly city, which the description seems designed to enforce upon our thoughts. The great and holy community will be one which draws its glory from God (<a href="/revelation/21-11.htm" title="Having the glory of God: and her light was like to a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;">Revelation 21:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm" title="And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 22:5</a>). Its blessings are not for a few, but open to all, for its gates lie open to all quarters (<a href="/context/revelation/21-12.htm" title="And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:">Revelation 21:12-13</a>).

But the time was not yet come. Ezekiel also describes <span class="ital">the holy city, </span>and what belongs to it, (chap. 40.-xlviii.,) but a city quite different from the <span class="ital">old Jerusalem, </span>as it was either before or after the Babylonish captivity. The descriptions of the prophet and of the apostle agree in many particulars; but in many more they differ. Ezekiel expressly describes the temple and the worship of God therein, closely alluding to the Levitical service. But St. John <span class="ital">saw no temple, </span>and describes the city far more large, and glorious, and heavenly, than the prophet. His description, indeed, is an assemblage of the sublimest, richest imagery, not only of Ezekiel, but of other ancient prophets. <span class="ital">Having the glory of God </span>— For her light, <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm" title="And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/60-1.htm" title="Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen on you....">Isaiah 60:1-2</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm" title="For I, said the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the middle of her.">Zechariah 2:5</a>; <span class="ital">and her light </span>— Or <span class="ital">the lustre thereof, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ο φωστηρ αυτης </span>may be rendered; <span class="ital">was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper </span>— For brightness; <span class="ital">clear as crystal </span>— The divine shechinah illuminating the whole city, which, as it was represented to St. John pendant in the air, shone with an elegant and amazing lustre, expressive of the perfect illumination, purity, and holiness of its happy inhabitants. <span class="ital">And had a wall great and high </span>— To show its strength and security under the almighty protection of its founder and preserver; <span class="ital">and had twelve gates </span>— With angels for guards, still waiting upon the heirs of salvation; <span class="ital">and names written thereon </span>— On the gates; <span class="ital">of the twelve tribes of Israel </span>— To signify that it was the dwelling of the Israel of God, and that such as had been faithful members of the true church had a right to be admitted, and to show also the great glory of that city, where angels were appointed to keep guard; an honour properly due only to the majesty of God’s presence, and to the seat of it. <span class="ital">On the east, north, south, and west,</span> <span class="ital">three gates </span>— To show that people of all climates and nations may have access to it. <span class="ital">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, </span>inscribed with <span class="ital">the names of the twelve apostles </span>— Figuratively showing how great dependance the church had on their testimony, what an influence the gospel which they preached had had on raising this divine structure, and that the inhabitants of it had built only on that faith which the apostles once delivered to the saints.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:9-21 God has various employments for his holy angels. Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there came unto me one of the seven angels ... - See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6-7</a>.

The scene is thus to be regarded in the way that the descending of the city (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>), which gives occasion for the speeches of <a href="/context/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God....">Revelation 21:3-8</a>, has already begun, but <a href="/revelation/21-10.htm" title="And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,">Revelation 21:10</a> proceeds further, so that, while the city is sinking down from heaven to earth, and here finds its place, John is carried by the angel to the mountain, and thence gazes upon the city now found upon earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4283] Cf.

The identical form of introduction emphasizes the contrast between Babylon and Jerusalem, the harlot and the bride.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">full</span>] According to the correct text, this word is made to agree not with “the seven bowls” but with “the seven angels.” But probably it is a merely accidental grammatical inaccuracy of St John’s. There is a much worse “false concord” in <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm" title="And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.">Revelation 14:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Spirit</span>] <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm" title="So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.">Revelation 17:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>.

The preposition rendered “to” plainly implies that St John was set <span class="ital">on</span> the mountain; whether the city occupied the mountain itself, or another site within view. In Ezek. l.c. the city apparently occupies the southern slope of the mountain, whence the seer views it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that great city, the holy Jerusalem</span>] Read, <span class="bld">the holy city Jerusalem</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">descending … from God</span>] <span class="ital">Verbatim</span> the same as in <span class="ital"><a href="/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a></span>, according to the true text. The descent described here is no doubt the same as there, but St John’s vision of the descent is not exactly the same. He has seen, as it were in the distance, the appearance of the city: but his attention was absorbed in listening to the sayings of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God....">Revelation 21:3-8</a></span>.

"Full of" must be connected with "angels." Just as these angels had carried out God's judgments upon the ungodly, and one of them had exhibited the judgment of the harlot (<a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>), so now one of them shows the picture of the bliss of the faithful - the bride of the Lamb. <span class="cmt_word">And talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife;</span> <span class="accented">hither</span> (omitting "come"). The wording of this verse (except the last phrase) is almost identical with <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1</a>. The last phrase is the great contrast to the former chapter. In <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. I was seen a picture of a harlot, the unfaithful part of Christ's Church; here we have a description of those who have been "faithful unto death" (<a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>), and whose purity and faithfulness are symbolized under the figure of the "wife of the Lamb" (see on Revelation 17:1). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Unto me<p>Omit.<p>Vials<p>Properly bowls.
