To what has been said may be added the following:—“Gold has an inalienable reference to the sun itself, consequently, to the symbol of the face of God, or Christ, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to the manifestation of God’s love” (Lange).<p>The wealth of heaven <span class= "ital">is</span> love; love is the circulating medium of all holy activity and of all holy work: all who dwell within the heavenly city are encompassed by it; all who tread the streets of that city move along the ways of love; no dimness or obscuring motives of self-interest mar its lustre—the gold is clear as pure glass.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:9-21 God has various employments for his holy angels. Sometimes they sound the trumpet of Divine Providence, and warn a careless world; sometimes they discover things of a heavenly nature of the heirs of salvation. Those who would have clear views of heaven, must get as near to heaven as they can, on the mount of meditation and faith. The subject of the vision is the church of God in a perfect, triumphant state, shining in its lustre; glorious in relation to Christ; which shows that the happiness of heaven consists in intercourse with God, and in conformity to him. The change of emblems from a bride to a city, shows that we are only to take general ideas from this description. The wall is for security. Heaven is a safe state; those who are there, are separated and secured from all evils and enemies. This city is vast; here is room for all the people of God. The foundation of the wall; the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the strong foundations of the safety and happiness of the church. These foundations are set forth by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellence of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or the personal excellences of the Lord Jesus Christ. Heaven has gates; there is a free admission to all that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. These gates were all of pearls. Christ is the Pearl of great price, and he is our Way to God. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. The saints in heaven tread gold under foot. The saints are there at rest, yet it is not a state of sleep and idleness; they have communion, not only with God, but with one another. All these glories but faintly represent heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the building of the wall of it - The material of which the wall was composed. This means the wall above the foundation, for that was composed of twelve rows of precious stones, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19-20</a>. The height of the foundation is not stated, but the entire wall above was composed of jasper.<p>Was of jasper - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/4-3.htm">Revelation 4:3</a>. Of course, this cannot be taken literally; and an attempt to explain all this literally would show that that method of interpreting the Apocalypse is impracticable.<p>And the city was pure gold - The material of which the edifices were composed.<p>Like unto clear glass - The word rendered "glass" in this place - &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  hualos - occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>. It means, properly, "anything transparent like water"; as, for example, any transparent stone or gem, or as rock-salt, crystal, glass (Robinson, Lexicon). Here the meaning is, that the golden city would be so bright and burnished that it would seem to be glass reflecting the sunbeams. Would the appearance of a city, as the sun is setting, when the reflection of its beams from thousands of panes of glass gives it the appearance of burnished gold, represent the idea here? If we were to suppose a city made entirely of glass, and the setting sunbeams falling on it, it might convey the idea represented here. It is certain that, as nothing could be more magnificent, so nothing could more beautifully combine the two ideas referred to here - that of "gold and glass."<p>Perhaps the reflection of the sunbeams from the "Crystal Palace," erected for the late "industrial exhibition" in London, would convey a better idea of what is intended to be represented here than anything which our world has furnished. The following description from one who was an eyewitness, drawn up by him at the time, and without any reference to this passage, and furnished at my request, will supply a better illustration of the passage before us than any description which I could give: "Seen as the morning vapors rolled around its base - its far-stretching roofs rising one above another, and its great transept, majestically arched, soaring out of the envelope of clouds - its pillars, window-bars, and pinnacles, looked literally like a castle in the air; like some palace, such as one reads of in idle tales of Arabian enchantment, having about it all the ethereal softness of a dream. Looked at from a distance at noon, when the sunbeams came pouring upon the terraced and vaulted roof, it resembles a regal palace of silver, built for some Eastern prince; 'when the sun at eventide sheds on its sides his parting rays, the edifice is transformed into a temple of gold and rubies;' and in the calm hours of night, when the moon walketh in her brightness, the immense surface of glass which the building presents looks like a sea, or like throwing back, in flickering smile, the radiant glances of the queen of heaven." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the building&#8212;"the structure" [Tregelles], Greek, "endomeesis."<p>gold, like &#8230; clear glass&#8212;Ideal gold, transparent as no gold here is [Alford].

The Egyptian mansion of Life is also composed of jasper, with four walls, facing the south, the north, the east, and the west (<span class="ital">cf. Records of Past</span>, 6:113).
