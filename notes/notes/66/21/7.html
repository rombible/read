The old world, with all its troubles and tumults, will have passed away. There will be no sea; this aptly represents freedom from conflicting passions, temptations, troubles, changes, and alarms; from whatever can divide or interrupt the communion of saints. This new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and perfect state, the church triumphant. Its blessedness came wholly from God, and depends on him. The presence of God with his people in heaven, will not be interrupt as it is on earth, he will dwell with them continually. All effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have often been in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the calamities of the church; but no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain. Christ makes all things new. If we are willing and desirous that the gracious Redeemer should make all things new in order hearts and nature, he will make all things new in respect of our situation, till he has brought us to enjoy complete happiness. See the certainty of the promise. God gives his titles, Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, as a pledge for the full performance. Sensual and sinful pleasures are muddy and poisoned waters; and the best earthly comforts are like the scanty supplies of a cistern; when idolized, they become broken cisterns, and yield only vexation. But the joys which Christ imparts are like waters springing from a fountain, pure, refreshing, abundant, and eternal. The sanctifying consolations of the Holy Spirit prepare for heavenly happiness; they are streams which flow for us in the wilderness. The fearful durst not meet the difficulties of religion, their slavish fear came from their unbelief; but those who were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, were yet so desperate as to run into abominable wickedness. The agonies and terrors of the first death will lead to the far greater terrors and agonies of eternal death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that overcometh - See the notes on <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>.<p>Shall inherit all things - Be an heir of God in all things.

(“This place” of bliss “is prepared for the righteous who endure every kind of attack in their lives from those who afflict their souls … for them this place is prepared as an eternal inheritance,” Slav. En. ix.). This is the sole allusion, and a purely incidental one, to that central conception of the messianic bliss as a <span class="greekheb">κληρονομία</span>, which bulks so prominently in apocalypses like Fourth Esdras and is employed in a cosmic sense by Paul as lordship over the whole creation (see Bacon, <span class="ital">Biblical and Semitic Studies</span>, Yale Univ. 1902, pp. 240 f.). The solitary allusion to sonship expresses the close relation to God for which this writer elsewhere prefers to use the metaphor of priesthood. Partly owing to the bent of his mind, partly owing to the stern circumstances of his age, he (like Clem. Rom.) allows the majesty and mystery of God to overshadow that simple and close confidence which Jesus inculcated towards the Father (Titius, 13, 14), as also the direct love of God for his people (only in <a href="/revelation/3-9.htm" title="Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.">Revelation 3:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm" title="As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.">Revelation 3:19</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm" title="And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.">Revelation 20:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/revelation/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">He that overcometh</span>] Carries back our thoughts to the promises at the beginning of the book, <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>, &c.

These words show the reason for the words of ver. 6; and may be called the text on which the Apocalypse is based (cf. <a href="/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a>.); for, though the words themselves do not often recur, yet the spirit of them is constantly appearing (cf. <a href="/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>; see also <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I will be his God, and he shall be my son</span> (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>, "And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people"). Some have thought that these words prove the Speaker to be God the Father; but it is impossible to separate the Persons of the Blessed Trinity in these chapters. This promise, first made to David concerning Solomon (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>), received its mystical fulfilment in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>), and is now fulfilled in the members of Christ (Alford). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>All things (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>The correct reading is &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; these things.
