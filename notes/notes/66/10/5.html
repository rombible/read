There is a change of tense which sounds strange: he says, then (not “will be,” but) was finished. In thought he hurries on to the end, and sees the close no longer in the dim future, but as, with the eye of God, an accomplished fact. The certainty is guaranteed with an oath. The gesture of the uplifted hand to give emphasis to the oath is of ancient date. Thus Abraham expressed his resolution to take none of the spoils of the conquered kings: “I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord . . . that I will not take from a thread to a shoelatchet” (<a href="/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>; comp. <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm" title="And I will bring you in to the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.">Exodus 6:8</a>, margin). So, too, does the man clothed in linen (<a href="/context/daniel/12-6.htm" title="And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?">Daniel 12:6-9</a>, a passage which, in much, is the foundation of the one before us) lift up both hands and sware that there shall be a fixed period for the accomplishment of the scattering of the power of the holy people. The oath in the passage under consideration is to the effect (not that time should cease and eternity begin, but) that there shall be no longer any delay. The suffering saints had cried, “How long?” (<a href="/context/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9-11</a>), and they had been bidden to wait a little time. Now the close of all such waiting time is announced: when the seventh trumpet shall have blown the mystery of God will be finished. “‘ The mystery of God’ does not mean something which cannot be understood or explained. It is never applied to such matters, for example, as the origin of evil, or the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity. It does mean a secret; but then a secret may be told, and when told is no mystery. The mystery, or secret, of God means, therefore, the whole of His plan and of His counsel concerning this earth in its present state of discipline and of imperfection; all that God means to do upon it and towards it, even till that which we read of as the time of the end (<a href="/context/daniel/12-4.htm" title="But you, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.">Daniel 12:4-9</a>), the close of this last dispensation, and the introduction of that new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness” (Dr. Vaughan). No wonder, as he announced this fast approaching close of the ages of suffering and trial, he should add, “According as He (not “declared”—an utterly inadequate word—but) evangelised—i.e., according to the glad tidings which He had ever proclaimed to and by His servants the prophets.” A somewhat remarkable parallelism between this passage and <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>, has been pointed out. In both passages there is reference to the mystery, the glad tidings, and the last (the seventh trumpet is also the last) trumpet. This harmony of reference—taken in connection with St. Paul’s statement, “We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed”—is full of interest, if it were for nothing more than to notice the union of thought between the two Apostles; but it may also throw light upon the teaching respecting the first resurrection (<a href="/context/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5-6</a>; but see Note there).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/10-5.htm" title="And the angel which I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,...">Revelation 10:5-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the angel, </span>&c. — But though I was not allowed to reveal what the seven thunders had uttered, yet the angel proceeded to give a further revelation of the dispensations of Divine Providence toward the world and the church in general; and, to confirm the truth and certainty of his revelation, he took his oath in the most solemn manner: he <span class="ital">lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever </span>— By the eternal God, before whom a thousand years are but as a day is with us; <span class="ital">who created </span>the <span class="ital">heaven, the earth, the sea, </span>&c. — And consequently has the sovereign power over all; therefore all his enemies, though they rage a while on the earth and on the sea, yet must give place to him: <span class="ital">That there should be time no longer </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">οτι χρονος ουκ εσται ετι</span>, <span class="ital">that the time shall not be yet; </span>(so Lowman and Bishop Newton understand it;) that is, that the lime of the glorious state of the church, though sure to take place in its due time, should not be yet; <span class="ital">but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel </span>— Who was yet to sound; <span class="ital">the mystery of God </span>— In his providence toward his church; <span class="ital">should be finished </span>— Or completed.

So long as the third wo remains on the earth and the sea, the mystery of God is not fulfilled. And the angel’s declaration that it shall be fulfilled, confirmed by a solemn oath, is made peculiarly for the consolation of holy men, who are afflicted under that wo. Indeed the wrath of God must be first fulfilled by the pouring out of the vials, and then comes the joyful fulfilling of the mystery of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-7 The apostle saw another representation. The person communicating this discovery probably was our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, or it was to show his glory. He veils his glory, which is too great for mortal eyes to behold; and throws a veil upon his dispensations. A rainbow was upon his head; our Lord is always mindful of his covenant. His awful voice was echoed by seven thunders; solemn and terrible ways of discovering the mind of God. We know not the subjects of the seven thunders, nor the reasons for suppressing them. There are great events in history, perhaps relating to the Christian church, which are not noticed in open prophecy. The final salvation of the righteous, and the final success of true religion on earth, are engaged for by the unfailing word of the Lord. Though the time may not be yet, it cannot be far distant. Very soon, as to us, time will be no more; but if we are believers, a happy eternity will follow: we shall from heaven behold and rejoice in the triumphs of Christ, and his cause on earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the angel which I saw stand ... - <a href="/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>.

For the angel swears, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὌΤΙ ΧΡΌΝΟς ΟὐΚΈΤΙ ἜΣΤΑΙ</span></span></span>, “that there should be time no longer.” The authentic norm for the correct explanation of this expression is given by what follows, which defines the same thing from the contrasted side, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ ἘΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἩΜ</span>., <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>). It is accordingly not an “entrance of a modern thought,”[2738] but a complete misunderstanding of the text, when many interpreters, following Beda,[2739] have understood the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΌΝΟς ΟὐΚΈΤΙ ἜΣΤΑΙ</span></span></span>, of the absolute cessation of time, i.e., of the beginning of eternity. The opposite parallel, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ ἘΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἩΜΈΡΑΙς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, by virtue of its chronological nature, excludes every explanation which presents the formula <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΌΝΟς ΟὐΚΈΤΙ ἜΣΤΑΙ</span></span></span> in any other way than chronologically. Ebrard, accordingly, is also incorrect when he understands by the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΌΝΟς</span></span></span>, a season of <span class="ital">grace</span>. On the other hand, however, the contrast, <a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>, as well as also the tenor of the formula <span class="greekheb">χρόν</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔστ</span>., forbids us to recognize in this a definite, technical expression of Apocalyptic chronology, as Bengel wished, who found here a “<span class="ital">non-chronus</span>,” i.e., a period of more than a thousand and less than eleven hundred years, and accordingly reckoned the closing epoch of this “<span class="ital">non-chronus</span>” (i.e., the beginning of the thousand years’ reign) as the year 1836, since the starting-point occurred, at all events, <span class="ital">before</span> the year 842, the concluding year of the second woe,[2740] and apparently in the year 800, in which the reign was established. Grot., Calov., Vitr., C. a Lap., Eichh., Ew., De Wette., Hengstenb., etc., have correctly recognized the fact that the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΌΝ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἜΣΤΑΙ</span></span></span> express the <span class="ital">immediate</span>, and the indeed very positively defined (<a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>), beginning of that which is called in <a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a> the fulfilment of the mystery of God. But naturally, from this formal unanimity of the most expositors, there proceeds directly the greatest diversity of views, when the question is concerning the more precise reference of the formula, <span class="greekheb">χρόν</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔστ</span>. according to the standard of what is said in <a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>. But Vitr. is inaccurate, even in a formal respect, when he says, “No delay of time is to intervene between the sound of the seventh trumpet, and the fulfilment of the prophetic oracles;”[2741] for the affirmative determination, <a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a>, says in apposition to the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΧΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἜΣΤΑΙ</span></span></span>, which deny a further delay, that the (immediate, <a href="/revelation/10-6.htm" title="And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:">Revelation 10:6</a>) fulfilment of the mystery of God is to occur just at the time of the seventh trumpet. The question, therefore, is not concerning a delay, perhaps still occurring between the seventh sound of the trumpet and the fulfilment of the mystery of God; but the angel swears that between the present point of time (which falls <span class="ital">after</span> the close of the sixth trumpet, and <span class="ital">before</span> the second part of the second woe, that is finished only at <a href="/revelation/11-14.htm" title="The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.">Revelation 11:14</a>), and the fulfilment of the mystery of God, which is to be expected within the time of the seventh trumpet, there will be no more interval. [See Note LXV., p. 309.] What, therefore, might have been expected already after the close of the sixth seal-vision, but yet did not occur, because ch. 7 brought a special preparation,—and, besides, from the seventh seal itself the new series of trumpet-visions proceeded, ch. 8 sq.,—is not to come immediately, and that, too, in the seventh trumpet. Yet it does not actually occur in <a href="/context/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,...">Revelation 11:16-19</a>.[2742]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΛΛʼ ἘΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἩΜΈΡΑΙς Τῆς ΦΩΝῆς ΤΟῦ ἙΒΔ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓΓ</span></span></span>. These words in combination with the immediately succeeding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΑΝ ΜΈΛΛΗ ΣΑΛΠΊΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, which contain an epexegetical description of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΩΝῆς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἙΒΔ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, appear to require an explanation like that of Bengel: “Thus the angel makes himself heard, not only at the beginning of these days, but continually throughout them.” The additional remark, “at the end of the days this trumpet acquires the name of the last trump” (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>), is, of course, entirely without foundation in the context. But even the first statement of Bengel conflicts with the analogy of all the trumpet-voices hitherto in their proper nature (which, nevertheless, the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΑΝ ΜΈΛΛῌ ΣΑΛΠ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> themselves recall); since, by the heavenly trumpet-sounds, not future things themselves, but only such manifestations as signify what is to occur on earth, are introduced. The seeming difficulty which lies, therefore, in the fact that what is said in <a href="/revelation/10-7.htm" title="But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.">Revelation 10:7</a> is of the “days” of the seventh trumpet, but which cannot be explained by regarding a continuance of the trumpet-voice during the whole of the still future period of that (actual) day, is very simply explained if it be acknowledged[2743] that in the expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἩΜΈΡΑΙς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΦΩΝ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἙΒΔ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΑΓΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> the standpoint of the vision is not purely maintained, but the reference to the events of the sixth trumpet-vision is intermingled; only from this last standpoint can we properly speak of the “days” of the last trumpet, viz., of the period in which that which is represented to the prophet by the final sound of the trumpet actually occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΤΕΛΈΣΘΗ</span></span></span>. The annexing of the conclusion is Hebraistic, since the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ</span></span></span> with the aor. corresponds to the Vav with the perf.[2744]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ θεοῦ</span>. The contextual determination of this idea—whose character is indicated, in general, already by the correlate ideas of divine revelation (<span class="greekheb">εὐηγγέλισε</span>), and of prophecy (<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">προφ</span>.) as the human announcement of the mystery revealed on God’s part[2745]—lies partly in the fact that its actual fulfilment[2746] is placed in the time of the seventh, and consequently the last, trumpet; partly in that its revelation is conceived of by the prophets as a <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζειν</span>, i.e., a communication of a joyful message. Besides, it needs no special proof, that the expression <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἑαυτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δούλ</span>., <span class="greekheb">τοὺς προφήτας</span>[2747] can refer only to O. T. prophets,[2748] but neither to N. T. prophets,[2749] nor to Christ and the apostles,[2750] as the mystery of God revealed to these prophets, and proclaimed by them, is infinitely more than the “divine counsel concerning freeing Christians from the oppression of the Jews.”[2751] According to the contextual indication just given, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, whose contents are here declared only by the general allusion to the O. T. predictions, refers to nothing but the glorious completion of the divine kingdom, the final goal whereto the deepest current of O.

Therefore the meaning is simply this: that, whereas the angel with the seal demands an interval of time before the opening of the seventh seal, which interval is to be employed in sealing the servants of God, so this angel, on the contrary, denies any further space for repentance, any respite for the ungodly, before the sounding of the seventh trumpet. He affirms that stroke is to succeed stroke, and that, in a certain limited period, all will be finished.” So, also, Beck, who, in illustration of this meaning of <span class="greekheb">χρόνος</span>, refers to its derivative <span class="greekheb">χρονίζειν</span>: <a href="/matthew/24-48.htm" title="But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming;">Matthew 24:48</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/revelation/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/revelation/10-5.htm" title="And the angel which I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,...">Revelation 10:5-6</a>.
