The fire devouring their foes seems to allude to <a href="/2_kings/1-10.htm" title="And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.">2Kings 1:10</a>; like Elijah, they can close the heaven (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>); like Moses, they can turn water into blood and summon down every plague (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.">Exodus 7:20</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.). </span>These last characteristics remind us of the spirit and power of Moses and Elias, but we must not forget what has gone before: the witnesses are like olive trees and lights. In them is concentrated grace, light, and power; their witness recalls the great features of various Old Testament teachers and leaders; they display the light of truth, and men may not oppose or injure them with impunity; they wield a power which it is not safe to provoke. As from the mouths of the great Sixth Trumpet host there went forth fire and smoke and brimstone to kill the third part of mankind, so out of the mouths of these witnesses there goes forth a purer, but mightier flame. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm" title="There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.">Psalm 18:8</a>.) We may compare the sword out of the mouth of Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>), and the promise to Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm" title="Why thus said the LORD God of hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.">Jeremiah 5:14</a>), “Behold I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood, and it shall devour them.” The word which is like a sword to lay bare man to himself may become a consuming fire to those who resist or oppose it. The witnesses for God are thus armed with a spiritual might; for that word which, when accepted and lived by, brings peace, when rejected causes pain and danger. Thus often do the things which might have been for men’s peace become an occasion for falling; the stone which, used and built into the life, becomes a precious corner-stone and immovable foundation, grinds to powder those upon whom it falls. Thus is it with these witnesses: they come to witness for principles which go to make the world a Paradise once more. The world, which casts away their words, will find them come back with scorching force; just as the breath of God gives life and beauty to the world, and power to men’s hearts and lives (<a href="/psalms/104-30.htm" title="You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth.">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="/john/20-22.htm" title="And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:">John 20:22</a>), yet with that same breath of His lips does He slay the wicked (<a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm" title="But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.">Isaiah 11:4</a>). Some have thought that there will be a time when witnesses for God will be raised up who will work literal wonders such as these. It is not for us to say that this will not be the case: all prophecy may take a sharper and clearer meaning as the times of the end draw near; but, meanwhile, it is needful for us to remember that the very power of truth is such that, when rejected, it can and does avenge itself by shutting heaven over our head, and making all the fresh rivulets of life’s purest pleasures loathsome as blood to the sensualised and perverted heart.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:3-13 In the time of treading down, God kept his faithful witnesses to attest the truth of his word and worship, and the excellence of his ways, The number of these witnesses is small, yet enough. They prophesy in sackcloth. It shows their afflicted, persecuted state, and deep sorrow for the abominations against which they protested. They are supported during their great and hard work, till it is done. When they had prophesied in sackcloth the greatest part of 1260 years, antichrist, the great instrument of the devil, would war against them, with force and violence for a time. Determined rebels against the light rejoice, as on some happy event, when they can silence, drive to a distance, or destroy the faithful servants of Christ, whose doctrine and conduct torment them. It does not appear that the term is yet expired, and the witnesses are not a present exposed to endure such terrible outward sufferings as in former times; but such things may again happen, and there is abundant cause to prophesy in sackcloth, on account of the state of religion. The depressed state of real Christianity may relate only to the western church. The Spirit of life from God, quickens dead souls, and shall quicken the dead bodies of his people, and his dying interest in the world. The revival of God's work and witnesses, will strike terror into the souls of his enemies. Where there is guilt, there is fear; and a persecuting spirit, though cruel, is a cowardly spirit. It will be no small part of the punishment of persecutors, both in this world, and at the great day, that they see the faithful servants of God honoured and advanced. The Lord's witnesses must not be weary of suffering and service, nor hastily grasp at the reward; but must stay till their Master calls them. The consequence of their being thus exalted was a mighty shock and convulsion in the antichristian empire. Events alone can show the meaning of this. But whenever God's work and witnesses revive, the devil's work and witnesses fall before him. And that the slaying of the witnesses is future, appears to be probable.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And if any man will hurt them - This implies that there would be those who would be disposed to injure or wrong them; that is, that they would be liable to persecution. The word "will" is here more than the mere sign of the future; it denotes "intention, purpose, design," &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;  thelei - "if any man wills or purposes to injure them." See a similar use of the word in <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>. The word "hurt" here means to do "injury" or "injustice" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  adike&#772;sai - and may refer to wrong in any form - whether in respect to their character, opinions, persons, or property. The general sense is, that there would be those who would be disposed to do them harm, and we should naturally look for the fulfillment of this in some form of persecution.<p>Fire proceedeth out of their mouth - It is, of course, not necessary that this should be taken literally. The meaning is, that they would have the power of destroying their enemies as if fire should proceed out of their mouth; that is, their words would be like burning coals or flames. There may possibly be an allusion here to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/1-10.htm">2 Kings 1:10-14</a>, where it is said that Elijah commanded the fire to descend from heaven to consume those who were sent to take him (compare <a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>); but in that case Elijah commanded the fire to come "from heaven"; here it proceedeth "out of the mouth." The allusion here, therefore, is to the denunciations which they would utter, or the doctrines which they would preach, and which would have the same effect on their enemies as if they breathed forth fire and flame. So <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>, "Because ye speak this word, Behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood, and it shall devour them."<p>And devoureth their enemies - The word "devour" is often used with reference to fire, which seems to "eat up" or "consume" what is in its way, or to "feed on" what it destroys. This is the sense of the word here - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  katesthiei - "to eat down, to swallow down, to devour." Compare <a href="/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>; Septuagint <a href="/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>. As there is no reason to believe that there would be literal fire, so it is not necessary to suppose that their enemies would be literally devoured or consumed. The meaning is fulfilled if their words should in any way produce an effect on their enemies similar to what is produced by fire: that is, if it should destroy their influence; if it should overcome and subdue them; if it should annihilate their domination in the world.<p>And if any man will hurt them - This is repeated in order to make the declaration more intensive, and also to add another thought about the effect of persecuting and injuring them.<p>He must in this manner be killed - That is, in the manner specified - by fire. It does not mean that he would be killed in the same manner in which the "witnesses" were killed, but in the method specified before - by the fire that should proceed out of their mouth. The meaning is, undoubtedly, that they would have power to bring down on them divine vengeance or punishment, so that there would be a just retaliation for the wrongs done them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. will hurt&#8212;Greek, "wishes," or "desires to hurt them."<p>fire &#8230; devoureth&#8212;(Compare Jer 5:14; 23:29).<p>out of their mouth&#8212;not literally, but God makes their inspired denunciations of judgment to come to pass and devour their enemies.<p>if any man will hurt them&#8212;twice repeated, to mark the immediate certainty of the accomplishment.<p>in this manner&#8212;so in like manner as he tries to hurt them (compare Re 13:10).

Do any injury to their persons, or properties, oppose their writings, blaspheme their doctrines, and hinder their ministrations; whoever; they be, whether they be any that live among them, or in other parts; whether they be secret or open enemies; or whether they be of the outward court, or be really Gentiles or Papists; and especially if they do them any injustice, if they wrong, oppress, afflict, and distress them knowingly and willingly: <p>fire proceedeth out of their mouth; by which may be meant the word of God, which they preach and hold forth, which is comparable to fire, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>, both for light, it being a means of enlightening sinners, who are darkness itself; and of directing saints in their walk and conversation; and of detecting the errors, immoralities, idolatry, and superstition of men, and particularly of the church of Rome, who cannot bear the light of this word, and therefore forbid the reading of it to the laity, and keep it locked up from them in the Latin tongue: and also for the heat of it, it being the means of quickening, or of conveying a vital heat to dead sinners; and of warming and comforting the saints, causing their hearts to burn within them, while they bear or read it, or meditate upon it; and of scorching and tormenting reprobate sinners, and filling them with wrath, pain, and anguish, especially the followers of antichrist; and this is greatly designed, for this has a particular reference to the pouring out of the fourth vial, <a href="/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a>. Likewise, the word of God may be compared to fire for its purity in itself, for every word of his is pure; and for its purifying nature, when faithfully preached, and powerfully applied, it penetrates deep, it searches, and discovers, and purges from the dross of profaneness, false doctrine, and will worship; and for its consuming nature, as follows, it pronouncing damnation to unbelievers and impenitent sinners, and it being the savour of death unto death to such: or else the prayers of these witnesses are intended by the fire that proceeds out of their mouth, for vengeance on their enemies, who hinder their ministrations, blaspheme the truth, and shed their blood; which do not arise from a passionate and revengeful spirit, but from a pure zeal for the glory of God, and the honour of his name, and truth; and which prayers are heard by God, who will avenge his elect, that cry unto him day and night: the allusion is to the fire, which, at the request of Moses, came forth from the Lord, and destroyed two hundred and fifty persons, that opposed him and Aaron; and to the fire which Elias called for from heaven, upon the captains, and the fifties, that came to take him, who were types of these witnesses; see <a href="/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>. And also this fire may denote the denunciations of God's wrath by them upon the antichristian party, these being as wood, and their words as fire, to consume them; see <a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>. <p>And devoureth their enemies: whether open or secret; just as the fire devoured Nadab and Abihu, the offerers of strange fire, which the Lord commanded not; so the fire out of the mouth of God's faithful servants devours such who introduce divers and strange doctrines, and the inventions of men, into the church of God; the light of God's word convinces and confounds them, though it may not convert them; it flashes in their consciences, and distresses them, so that they gnaw their tongues for pain; there being nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour and destroy them, though not corporeally, yet spiritually and eternally; for even these shall afterwards make war against them, conquer them, and slay them, and shall see them ascend to heaven,  <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>. <p>And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed; this is repeated, partly to show the certainty of this destruction; and partly to point out the manner of it, which will be not by the use of carnal weapons: these enemies of the witnesses will not be killed by the sword, or any other weapon, but by the word of God, and through the prayers of the saints, and by the denunciations of God's judgments on them.

The allegorists are, also, mostly consistent in this, but they arrive at the most wonderful interpretations. In the “power to shut heaven, that it rain not,” <a href="/revelation/11-6.htm" title="These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.">Revelation 11:6</a>, the two witnesses are like Elijah;[2852] even the specification of time here corresponds, as the days of their prophetic employment during which it is not to rain,[2853] agree, according to <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a>, with the three and a half years during which Elijah kept the heaven shut.[2854] The further “power over the waters (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊ</span></span></span>)[2855] to turn them to blood,” the two witnesses have in common with Moses;[2856] the last words also, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΠΑΤΆΞΑΙ ΤῊΝ ΓῆΝ ἘΝ ΠΆΣῌ ΠΛΗΓῇ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, contain a retrospective view to the <span class="ital">plagues</span> with which Moses <span class="ital">smote</span> the Egyptians,[2857] although unlimited power is given both witnesses “to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.” These decided words once more make it manifest in the most definite way, that the issuing of fire from the mouth of the witnesses, the closing of the heaven, and the turning of water into blood,[2858] are clearly particular <span class="ital">plagues</span> of the kind inflicted by Elijah and Moses. If we are not to interpret 1 Kings 17, <a href="/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">Jam 5:17</a>, Exodus 7 sqq., allegorically, we must abide also in this passage by the literal sense, yet must not deduce therefrom that “the power of the keys”[2859] is here ascribed the two witnesses, in virtue of which they close the heaven spiritually, and hold back the spiritual rain of the gospel,[2860] cause bloodshed to come from the gospel,[2861] or—if the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὝΔΑΤΑ</span></span></span> which are turned into blood be understood as the waters out of which the antichristian beast (i.e., the papacy) arises—could excite the conflicts between popes and antipopes.[2862] This kind of consequent allegorizing was doubtful already to Grot., who, therefore, tries to escape with the vague explanation, “There is nothing so great which they do not obtain on asking from God.”[2863]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2843] Cf. <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a> sqq.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2844] Ewald, De Wette, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2845] Beng., Hengstenb., etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2846] “Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2847] Against Beda, N. de Lyra, Aret., Par., Calov., Hengstenb., Ebrard.
