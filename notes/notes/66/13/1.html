It is true that the sentence has a connection with that chapter, but it is also closely linked with what follows. The way in which the dragon carries out his plan of war is described. Like Milton’s “superior fiend,” he stands upon the shore and summons his legions (<span class= "ital">Par. Lost, </span>Book I.) to another form of war. Two monsters, one distinguished by more brutal, the other by more subtle power, rise at his bidding.<p><span class= "bld">And saw . . .</span>—Translate, <span class= "ital">And I saw a wild beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.</span>—The wild beast rises out of the sea. In the vision of Daniel (Revelation 7) the beasts rose out of the sea upon which the four winds strove. The sea represents the great, restless mass of human kind; or, as it is expressed in <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm" title="And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.">Revelation 17:15</a>, “peoples and multitudes.” St. James represented an undecided man as a wave driven by the wind (<a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">James 1:6</a>). The individuals, like larger and smaller waves, make up this great ocean-like mass of men, swayed by impulse or passion. Out of the sea rises a wild beast. The word is not the same as that used in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm" title="And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.">Revelation 4:7</a> (see Note there), but is a word which implies the predominance of the beast nature. Whatever power rises is one which rules not by love or right, but by fear and wilfulness. It is the great force of the world-power, which in every age has been antagonistic to the power of right. The wild beast is always the figure of the kingdoms of this world—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the kingdoms which are founded on passion or selfishness. They are seven in number, as the beast had seven heads. We read afterwards of seven mountains. These world-powers are spoken of as mountains for their strength and stability; as heads of the wild beast because, though separate, they are inspired by the dragon spirit, the spirit of utter enmity to the rule of the Righteous King. The seven kingdoms, or heads of the wild beast, are more distinctly explained in <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>. There we read that five are fallen, one was in possession of power, and the seventh had not yet arisen. The key is thus placed in our hands. The sixth head is imperial Rome, the successor of those great world-powers which were, one and all, founded in unrighteousness—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in violation of the law of brotherly kindness and faith. The heads carry the names of blasphemy. The spirit of arrogant self-sufficiency characterised all the world-powers. Illustrations would be too numerous for our space. It is enough to refer to the spirit in Babylon: “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?” The words were Nebuchadnezzar’s (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm" title="The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?">Daniel 4:30</a>). He became a beast in uttering them; but the spirit of them went through all the world-powers, from the days of Lamech (<a href="/context/genesis/4-23.htm" title="And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.">Genesis 4:23-24</a>) and Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm" title="And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>) to the days when Roman poets prostituted their pens in abject flattery of emperors, and a degraded people welcomed them as gods, and put those to death who refused to offer frankincense and wine to the images of those who wore the purple.<p><span class= "bld">Ten horns.</span>—The beast has, besides seven heads, ten horns, which are explained further on (<a href="/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a>) as “the kings which have received no kingdom as yet,” but which, when they rise, will draw their strength from the dragon and be members of the wild beast.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/revelation/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy....">Revelation 13:1-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, </span>&c. — Here <span class="ital">the beast </span>is described at large, who was only mentioned before, <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>; and a <span class="ital">beast, </span>in the prophetic style, is a tyrannical idolatrous empire.

No doubt is to be made that this beast was designed to represent the Roman empire; for thus far both ancients and moderns, Papists and Protestants, are agreed: the only controversy is, whether it was Rome, pagan or Christian, imperial or papal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St. John saw this beast <span class="ital">rising </span>out of the sea, but the Roman empire was risen and established long before St. John’s time; and therefore this must be the Roman empire, not in its then present, but in some future shape and form; and it arose in another shape and form after it was broken to pieces by the incursions of the northern nations. The beast hath <span class="ital">seven heads and ten horns </span>— Which are the well-known marks of the Roman empire, the <span class="ital">seven heads </span>alluding to the seven mountains whereon Rome was seated, and to the seven forms of government which successively prevailed there; and the <span class="ital">ten horns </span>signifying the ten kingdoms into which the Roman empire was divided. It is remarkable that the dragon had <span class="ital">seven crowns upon his heads, </span>but the beast hath <span class="ital">upon his horns ten crowns </span>— So that there had been, in the mean while, a revolution of power from the <span class="ital">heads </span>of the dragon to the <span class="ital">horns </span>of the beast, and the sovereignty, which before was exercised by Rome alone, was now transferred and divided among ten kingdoms; but the Roman empire was not divided into ten kingdoms till after it was become Christian. Although the heads had lost their crowns, yet still they retained <span class="ital">the names of blasphemy </span>— In all its heads, in all its forms of government, Rome was still guilty of idolatry and blasphemy. Imperial Rome was called, and delighted to be called, <span class="ital">The eternal city; the heavenly city; the goddess of the earth; the goddess: </span>and had her temples and altars, with incense and sacrifices offered up to her: and how the papal Rome likewise hath arrogated to herself divine titles and honours will be shown hereafter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As Daniel’s fourth beast (<a href="/daniel/7-6.htm" title="After this I beheld, and see another, like a leopard, which had on the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.">Daniel 7:6</a>) was without a name, and <span class="ital">devoured and brake in pieces </span>the three former; so this beast (<a href="/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.">Revelation 13:2</a>) is also without a name, and partakes of the nature and qualities of the three former; having the body of <span class="ital">a leopard — </span>Which was the third beast, or Grecian empire; and <span class="ital">the feet of a bear </span>— Which was the second beast, or Persian empire; <span class="ital">and the mouth of a lion </span>— Which was the first beast, or Babylonian empire: and consequently this must be the same as Daniel’s fourth beast, or the Roman empire. But still it is not the same beast, the same empire entirely, but with some variation. <span class="ital">And the dragon gave him his power — </span><span class="greekheb">Δυναμιν</span>, or his armies; <span class="ital">and his seat </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ορονον</span>, or his imperial throne; <span class="ital">and great authority </span>— Or jurisdiction over all the parts of his empire. <span class="ital">The beast, </span>therefore, is the successor and substitute of <span class="ital">the dragon, </span>or of the idolatrous heathen Roman empire: and what other idolatrous power hath succeeded to the heathen emperors in Rome, all the world is a judge and a witness. <span class="ital">The dragon, </span>having failed in his purpose of restoring the old heathen idolatry, delegates his power to <span class="ital">the beast, </span>and thereby introduces a new species of idolatry, nominally different, but essentially the same, the worship of angels and saints, instead of the gods and demigods of antiquity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another mark, whereby the beast is peculiarly distinguished, is, (<a href="/revelation/13-3.htm" title="And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.">Revelation 13:3</a>,) <span class="ital">one of his heads as it were wounded to death </span>— It will appear hereafter, that this head was the sixth head, for <span class="ital">five were fallen </span>(<a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>) before St. John’s time: and the sixth head was that of the Cesars, or emperors, there having been before, kings, and consuls, and dictators, and decemvirs, and military tribunes, with consular authority. The sixth head was <span class="ital">as it were wounded to death, </span>when the Roman empire was overturned by the northern nations, and an end was put to the very name of emperor in Momyllus Augustulus; or rather, as the government of the Gothic kings was much the same as that of the emperors, with only a change of the name, this head was more effectually <span class="ital">wounded to death, </span>when Rome was reduced to a poor dukedom, and made tributary to the exarchate of Ravenna. But not only one of his heads was, as it were, wounded to death, but <span class="ital">his deadly wound was healed </span>— If it was the sixth head which was wounded, that wound could not be healed by the rising of the seventh head; the same head which was wounded must be healed: and this was effected by the pope and people of Rome revolting from the exarch of Ravenna, and proclaiming <span class="ital">Charles the Great </span>Augustus and emperor of the Romans. Here the wounded imperial head was <span class="ital">healed </span>again, and hath subsisted ever since. At this time, partly through the pope, and partly through the emperor, supporting and strengthening each other, the Roman name again became formidable: <span class="ital">and all the world wondered after the beast; and </span>(<a href="/revelation/13-4.htm" title="And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who is able to make war with him?">Revelation 13:4</a>) <span class="ital">they worshipped the dragon, which gave power unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? </span>— No kingdom or empire was <span class="ital">like </span>that of the beast; it had no parallel upon earth; and it was in vain for any to <span class="ital">resist </span>or <span class="ital">oppose </span>it; it prevailed and triumphed over all; and <span class="ital">all the world, </span>in submitting thus to the religion of the beast, did in effect submit again to the religion of the dragon, it being the old idolatry with new names. For the worshipping of demons and idols is in effect the worshipping of devils.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/revelation/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-10 The apostle, standing on the shore, saw a savage beast rise out of the sea; a tyrannical, idolatrous, persecuting power, springing up out of the troubles which took place. It was a frightful monster! It appears to mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, even from the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to the church. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute the righteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under the fourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted the saints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was the dragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The wounding the head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of the wound, introducing popish idolatry, the same in substance, only in a new dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. The world admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernal power and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatures which belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success are limited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, recorded in his book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichrist may overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannot conquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake their Saviour, and join his enemies. Perseverance in the faith of the gospel and true worship of God, in this great hour of trial and temptation, which would deceive all but the elect, is the character of those registered in the book of life. This powerful motive and encouragement to constancy, is the great design of the whole Revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/revelation/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I stood upon the sand of the sea - The sand upon the shore of the sea. That is, he seemed to stand there, and then had a vision of a beast rising out of the waters. The reason of this representation may, perhaps, have been that among the ancients the sea was regarded as the appropriate place for the origin of huge and terrible monsters (Prof. Stuart, in loco). This vision strongly resembles that in <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a> ff, where the prophet saw four beasts coming up in succession from the sea. See the notes on that place. In Daniel, the four winds of heaven are described as striving upon the great sea <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/13-2.htm">Daniel 13:2</a>, and the agitated ocean represents the nations in commotion, or in a state of disorder and anarchy, and the four beasts represent four successive kingdoms that would spring up. See the notes on <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>. In the passage before us, John indeed describes no storm or tempest; but the sea itself, as compared with the land (see the notes on <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a>), represents an agitated or unsettled state of things, and we should naturally. look for that in the rise of the power here referred to. If the reference be to the civil or secular Roman power that has always appeared in connection with the papacy, and that has always followed its designs, then it is true that it rose amidst the agitations of the world, and from a state of commotion that might well be represented by the restless ocean. The sea in either case naturally describes a nation or people, for this image is frequently so employed in the Scriptures. Compare, as above, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>, and <a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-42.htm">Jeremiah 51:42</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>. The natural idea, therefore, in this passage, would be that the power that was represented by the "beast" would spring up among the nations, when restless or unsettled, like the waves of the ocean.<p>And saw a beast - Daniel saw four in succession <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-7</a>, all different, yet succeeding each other; John saw two in succession, yet strongly resembling each other, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11</a>. On the general meaning of the word "beast" - &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  the&#772;rion - see the notes on <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>. The beast here is evidently a symbol of some power or kingdom that would arise in future times. See the notes on <a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>.<p>Having seven heads - So also the dragon is represented in <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>. See the notes on that passage. The representation there is of Satan, as the source of all the power lodged in the two beasts that John subsequently saw. In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9</a>, referring substantially to the same vision, it is said that "the seven heads are seven mountains"; and there can be no difficulty, therefore, in referring this to the seven hills on which the city of Rome was built (compare the notes on <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>), and consequently this must be regarded as designed, in some way, to be a representation of Rome.<p>And ten horns - See this also explained in the notes on <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; compare also the more extended illustration in the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>, following The reference here is to Rome, or the one Roman power, contemplated as made up of ten subordinate kingdoms, and therefore subsequently to the invasion of the Northern hordes, and to the time when the papacy was about to rise. Compare <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>; "And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings (marg. "kingdoms"), which have received no kingdom as yet, but receive power as kings with the beast." For a full illustration of this, see the copious notes at the close of the seventh chapter of Daniel.<p>And upon his horns ten crowns - Greek, "ten diadems." See the notes on <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>. These indicated dominion or authority. In <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>, the "dragon is represented as having seven diadems on his head"; here, the beast is represented as having ten. The dragon there represents the Roman domination, as such, the seven-hilled, or seven-headed power, and, therefore, properly described as having seven diadems; the beast here represents the Roman power, as now broken up into the ten dominations which sprung up (see the notes on Daniel as above) from the one original Roman power, and that became henceforward the supporters of the papacy, and, therefore, properly represented here as having ten diadems.<p>And upon his heads the name of blasphemy - That is, the whole power was blasphemous in its claims and pretensions. The word "blasphemy" here seems to be used in the sense that titles and attributes were claimed by it which belonged only to God. On the meaning of the word "blasphemy," see the notes on <a href="/matthew/9-3.htm">Matthew 9:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>. The meaning here is, that each one of these heads appeared to have a frontlet, with an inscription that was blasphemous, or that ascribed some attribute to this power that properly belonged to God; and that the whole power thus assumed was in derogation of the attributes and claims of God. In regard to the propriety of this description considered as applicable to the papacy, see the notes on <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/revelation/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 13<p>Re 13:1-18.

Hence, the world powers seeking their own glory, and not God's, are represented as beasts; and Nebuchadnezzar, when in self-deification he forgot that "the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men," was driven among the beasts. In Da 7:4-7 there are four beasts: here the one beast expresses the sum-total of the God-opposed world power viewed in its universal development, not restricted to one manifestation alone, as Rome. This first beast expresses the world power attacking the Church more from without; the second, which is a revival of, and minister to, the first, is the world power as the false prophet corrupting and destroying the Church from within.<p>out of the sea&#8212;(Da 7:3; compare Note, see on [2718]Re 8:8); out of the troubled waves of peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues. The earth (Re 13:11), on the other hand, means the consolidated, ordered world of nations, with its culture and learning.<p>seven heads and ten horns&#8212;A, B, and C transpose, "ten horns and seven heads." The ten horns are now put first (contrast the order, Re 12:3) because they are crowned. They shall not be so till the last stage of the fourth kingdom (the Roman), which shall continue until the fifth kingdom, Christ's, shall supplant it and destroy it utterly; this last stage is marked by the ten toes of the two feet of the image in Da 2:33, 41, 42. The seven implies the world power setting up itself as God, and caricaturing the seven Spirits of God; yet its true character as God-opposed is detected by the number ten accompanying the seven. Dragon and beast both wear crowns, but the former on the heads, the latter on the horns (Re 12:3; 13:1). Therefore, both heads and horns refer to kingdoms; compare Re 17:7, 10, 12, "kings" representing the kingdoms whose heads they are. The seven kings, as peculiarly powerful&#8212;the great powers of the world&#8212;are distinguished from the ten, represented by the horns (simply called "kings," Re 17:12). In Daniel, the ten mean the last phase of the world power, the fourth kingdom divided into ten parts. They are connected with the seventh head (Re 17:12), and are as yet future [Auberlen]. The mistake of those who interpret the beast to be Rome exclusively, and the ten horns to mean kingdoms which have taken the place of Rome in Europe already, is, the fourth kingdom in the image has TWO legs, representing the eastern as well as the western empire; the ten toes are not upon the one foot (the west), as these interpretations require, but on the two (east and west) together, so that any theory which makes the ten kingdoms belong to the west alone must err. If the ten kingdoms meant were those which sprung up on the overthrow of Rome, the ten would be accurately known, whereas twenty-eight different lists are given by so many interpreters, making in all sixty-five kingdoms! [Tyso in De Burgh]. The seven heads are the seven world monarchies, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, the Germanic empire, under the last of which we live [Auberlen], and which devolved for a time on Napoleon, after Francis, emperor of Germany and king of Rome, had resigned the title in 1806. Faber explains the healing of the deadly wound to be the revival of the Napoleonic dynasty after its overthrow at Waterloo. That secular dynasty, in alliance with the ecclesiastical power, the Papacy (Re 13:11, &c.), being "the eighth head," and yet "of the seven" (Re 17:11), will temporarily triumph over the saints, until destroyed in Armageddon (Re 19:17-21). A Napoleon, in this view, will be the Antichrist, restoring the Jews to Palestine, and accepted as their Messiah at first, and afterwards fearfully oppressing them. Antichrist, the summing up and concentration of all the world evil that preceded, is the eighth, but yet one of the seven (Re 17:11).<p>crowns&#8212;Greek, "diadems."<p>name of blasphemy&#8212;So C, Coptic, and Andreas. A, B, and Vulgate read, "names of blasphemy," namely, a name on each of the heads; blasphemously arrogating attributes belonging to God alone (compare Note, see on [2719]Re 17:3).

I think, therefore, we must distinguish between the rise and reign of antichrist. It doth not seem to me reasonable to make his reign to commence higher than the year 600, or 606, when he arrogated to himself the primacy; and that was confirmed to Boniface the Third by Phocas, in requital of Boniface’s kindness to him, who had got the empire by the base murder of Mauritius his master, and of all his children, and stood in need of the pope’s help to support him. From that time, I judge, the one thousand two hundred and sixty years should be counted; but <span class="ital">Nemo repente fit pessimus, </span> we must allow the papacy some time to come to this virile estate from his cradle. And I see no great harm of allowing the two hundred years, from the year 400 to 600, for this. So that I do think that in this chapter is shortly revealed what should happen to the church from about the year 400, or the space of forty-two months, or one thousand two hundred and sixty years, the time of the beast’s reign. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And I stood upon the sand of the sea:</span> the place of John’s present residence was Patmos, which was an island, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/1-9.htm" title="I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.">Revelation 1:9</a></span>.

There are other notions about this beast: some would have it to be the devil, but he is plainly distinguished, <span class="bld"><a href="/revelation/12-2.htm" title="And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.">Revelation 12:2</a>,4</span>, from the dragon. Some would have it to be the Turk; but we read of the worshipping of this beast, which is what we read not done to the Turkish emperors, who also began not till above the year 1200, (though indeed the Saracens began five hundred years before), but Rome, which never was the Turk’s seat, is made the seat of this beast. Some would have it to be idolatry itself; this was Grotius’s notion: see the reasons against it in Mr. Pool’s Synopsis Latina. Some would have it the pagan empire of Rome; but John never saw the first rise of that. This is a beast that rose after the dragon was cast down; which must be the Roman empire under the dominion of the papacy, in which respect only it is now one beast again; for otherwise in civil respects it is divided into ten crowned horns, i.e. distinct, independent kingdoms or principalities. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/revelation/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I stood upon the sand of the sea,.... The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, "and he stood", &amp;c. and so the Alexandrian copy; meaning the dragon, said to be wroth with the woman, and to go forth to make war with her seed, in the latter part of the preceding chapter, where some versions place this clause; and the Arabic version reads expressly, "and the serpent stood", &amp;c. And this is thought by some to be the better reading, because of the connection with what goes before, and because there is no mention of the name of John, nor of his being called or removed from heaven, where he was beholding sights, and continuing the account of them, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, as there is when he is shown sights elsewhere; see <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>. And besides, as the dragon was contriving a new way of persecuting the saints, and about to raise up a beast out of the sea, by which he might do it, to whom he would give his power, seat, and authority, he is represented as standing in a proper place for this purpose; it was upon the sand, which may signify a multitude of people employed by him, and also may denote the weakness and failure of his efforts in the issue; yet the Greek copies in general agree in the common reading, and refer it to John, who stood on the shore of the isle of Patmos, and in a fit place, in a visionary way, to behold the following sight: for that the next clause belongs to him is without doubt, <p>and saw a beast rise up out of the sea: by which is meant, not the devil, because it is in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>, distinguished from the dragon, who is the devil and Satan, as also elsewhere, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/16-13.htm">Revelation 16:13</a>, nor the old Roman empire, though there are many things which seem to agree; the Roman monarchy is called a beast it is one of the four beasts in <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>; which rose up out of the sea, from a multitude of people and nations, which were gathered to it and composed it. Rome Pagan had, as this beast has, seven heads and ten horns, <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; and had power over all nations, and is therefore sometimes called the whole world, and exercised great cruelty upon the Christians; but then this is signified by the red dragon itself, in the preceding chapter, and, besides, had risen up before the times of John, whereas this is one of the things shown him, which should be hereafter: this beast then was not, but was to come, <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; and was not to arise, nor did it arise till after the downfall of Rome Pagan, and after the Arian persecution, after the woman's flight into the wilderness, and after, and upon the inundation of the barbarous nations into the empire, as appears from the preceding chapter; nor will the time of this beast's duration agree with the old Roman empire, for this beast is to continue forty two months, <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>; which is the whole time of the holy city being trodden under foot, and of the church's being in the wilderness, and of the witnesses prophesying in sackcloth; whereas the Roman monarchy, governed by emperors, did not last four hundred years. Moreover, as this beast is distinguished from the dragon, so it is said to have its power from him; whereas the Roman empire was of God, and obedience and subjection to it are always recommended to the saints in the Scriptures, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, much less can the empire, as become truly Christian, be intended; nor are either the eastern or the Turkish empires designed, for neither of these had their seat at Rome, which the dragon save to this beast, but at Constantinople: it remains then, that by it meant the Roman empire, when divided into ten kingdoms, and united in the Papacy; or it designs Christ in his secular power, with the ten kings, that receive power with him as such one hour, and give their kingdom to him: now this beast is said to "rise up out of the sea"; either out of the abyss, the bottomless pit of hell, see <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; or out of the sea of this world, and the wicked in it, who are like a troubled sea that cannot rest; or out of the floods of errors and heresies, by which this man of sin was conceived and cherished, and a way was paved for his open rising and appearance in the world; or rather, since waters design, in this book, nations, people, and tongues, see <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>; and the four beasts in Daniel are said to rise out of the sea, <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; and a multitude of people are compared to the waves of the sea, <a href="/ezekiel/26-3.htm">Ezekiel 26:3</a>; see also <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>, where the Jewish writers say (b), the nations are compared to the sea, as Israel to the sand, the inundation of the barbarous nations, the Goths, Huns, and Vandals, into the empire, seem to be intended, which made great commotions and changes in it: these set up ten kingdoms in it, upon which antichrist arose, and placed himself at the head of them; these gave their kingdoms to the beast; and so may be said to give rise unto him, especially as to his secular power. <p>Having seven heads: which some understand the seat of knowledge, and seven a number of perfection; and so may refer to those boasted treasures of wisdom and knowledge which antichrist pretends to have, as being the judge of controversies, and the infallible interpreter of the Scriptures; or else the seven fold form of government among the Romans is intended, as in <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; or rather as it is interpreted in <a href="/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9</a>; the seven mountains on which Rome was built, and so design the city itself built on them, that being the metropolis of the empire; or the seven capital cities of the empire, as Mr. Daubuz thinks; the whole is meant, for it is the same Roman monarchy as before, only in a different form: <p>and ten horns; the ten kingdoms, into which the empire was divide it upon its being wasted and vanquished by the Goths, and the ten kings of them, which reigned with the beast, and gave their kingdoms to him; so horns signify kingdoms in <a href="/zechariah/1-18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>. <p>And upon his horns ten crowns; which distinguishes Rome Papal from Rome Pagan; the crowns in Rome Pagan were upon the heads, or the emperors, that resided at Rome; and though it had ten horns, as here, and was divided into so many provinces, which were governed by deputies, proconsuls, &amp;c. yet they were not kings, they had no crowns; but here the horns have crowns on them because the governors of these ten kingdoms are crowned kings: <p>and upon his heads the name of blasphemy; which refers not to Rome Pagan being called the eternal city, and Rome the goddess, and the like; but to Rome Papal, or antichrist, who elsewhere is said to have the name "Mystery" written upon the forehead, and to have blasphemy on his heads; and is called blasphemy in the abstract, as being a most blasphemous creature against God, Christ, and his people, and so his name is suitable to his character, mouth, and language, <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>; assuming that to himself which only belongs to God and Christ, as power over the conscience, to forgive sin, &amp;c. and even deity itself; see <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>.

But the providence of God resisted his attempt, that he might save the Church of the Gentiles, yet tender and green. The rest of this story of the dragon is excellently presented by the apostle John later in Re 20:1-15. For here the dragon endeavouring to do wickedness, was by God cast into prison.<p>(1) The apostle having declared the forming of the Christian Church, and the state of the Church from which ours takes her beginning, now goes to the story of the progress of it, as is shown in the beginning of the former chapter. This history of the progress of the Church and the battles of it, is recorded in this chapter, but distinctly in two parts, one is of the civil Roman Empire, Re 13:1-10. Another of the ecclesiastic or prophetic body, there to the end of the chapter. In the first part these things are shown: First the state of the Empire, in Re 13:1-4 then the acts of it in Re 13:5-7 after the effect: which is exceedingly great glory Re 13:8. Last of all is commended the use: and the instruction of the godly against the evils that shall come from the same in Re 13:9,10. The history of the state, contains a most ample description of the beast, first entire in Re 13:1,2 and then restored after harm, Re 13:3,4.<p>(2) On the sand where the devil stood practising new tempests against the Church, in the verse next before going: at which time the Empire of Rome was endangered by domestic dissensions and was mightily tossed, having ever and again new heads, and new emperors. See Re 17:8<p>(3) Having the same instruments of power, providence, and most expert government which the dragon is said to have had, in Re 12:3.<p>(4) We read in Re 12:3 that the dragon had seven crowns set upon seven heads because the thief claims to be proper lord and prince of the world, but this beast is said to have ten crowns, set on several, not heads but horns: because the beast is obligated to the dragon for all; Re 13:2 and does not otherwise reign, then by law of subjection given by him, namely that he employ his horns against the Church of God. The speech is taken from the ancient custom and form of dealing in such ease: by which they that were absolute kings did wear the diadem on their heads: but their vassals and such as reigned by grace from them, wore the same on their hoods: for so they might commodiously lay down their diadems when they came into the presence of their sovereigns, as also the elders are said, when they adored God which sat upon the throne, to have cast down their crowns before him in Re 4:10<p>(5) Contrary to that which God of old commanded should be written in the head piece of the high Priest, that is, Sanctitas Jehova, Holiness unto the Lord. The name of blasphemy imposed by the dragon, is that which Paul says in 2Th 2:4 He sits as God and boasts himself to be God For this name of blasphemy both the Roman Emperors did then challenge to themselves, as Suetonius and Dion do report of Caigula and Domitian: and after them the popes of Rome professed the same of themselves, when they challenged to themselves sovereignty in holy things of which kind of sayings the sixth book of the Decretals, the Clementines, and the Extravagants, are very full. For these men were not content with that which Anglicus wrote in his Poetria, (the beginning of which is Papa stupor mundi The pope is the wonder of the world) Nec Deus es, nec homo, sed neuter es inter utrungue. Thou art not God, nor art thou man, but neuter mixed of both: as the gloss witnesses on the sixth book: But they were bold to take to themselves the very name of God, and to accept it given of other: according as almost a hundred and twenty years since there was made for Sixtus the fourth, when he should first enter into Rome in his papal dignity, a Pageant of triumph, and cunningly fixed upon the gate of the city he should enter at, having written upon it this blasphemous verse: Oraclo vocis mundi moderaris habenas, Et merito in terrs crederis esse Deus. That is, By oracle of thine own voice, the world thou governest all, And worthily a God on earth men think and do thee call. These and six hundred the like who can impute to that modesty by which good men of old would have themselves called the servants of the servants of God? Verily either this is a name of blasphemy, or there is none at all.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/revelation/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div>Rev 12:18. <span class="greekheb">και ἐστάθη</span>.

The following hints may serve for the preliminary fixing of points amidst the complication of expositions of the details and of the whole, that cross one another:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The <span class="ital">interpretation</span> of the beast upon the sea, <a href="/context/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy....">Revelation 13:1-10</a>,—which appears also in <a href="/context/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon....">Revelation 13:11-18</a> as the chief beast, and whose correct interpretation is, therefore, the chief question,—is attempted in a twofold way, as in the beast there is, or is not, found a symbol of the Roman character (worldly dominion and power, the worship of idols, and superstition, etc.). The two chief species of exposition have each, again, two particular forms, which are very distinct. While many expositors in their reference to Rome refer only to pagan Rome,[3213] others have in mind Christian, i.e., papal, antichristian Rome.[3214] On the other hand, however, many expositors also, who interpreted neither the entire form of the beast, nor all his individual features, as referring to Rome, yet have assumed a reference to papal Rome by regarding the beast,[3215] as a whole, as pertaining to the description of the secular power, and have found the appearance of the secular power in the papacy symbolized, at least, by one part of the form of the beast, viz., by one of the seven heads;[3216] while, especially by Catholic interpreters,[3217] a mode of explanation is recommended, which regards the reference to Rome as distant as possible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3213] Victorin., Beda, Alcas, Bossuet, Hammond, Grot., Wetst., Elchh., Herd., Ewald, De Wette, Lücke, Bleek.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3214] Coccej., Vitr., Luther, Calov, Bengel., and many others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3215] A. Ch. Lämmert (<span class="ital">Babel, das Their u. der falsche Prophet</span>, Gotha, 1863), depending on Auberlen, has wandered into arbitrary generalities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3216] Hengstenb., Ebrard, Auberlen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3217] C. a Lap., Stern; cf. also already Andr.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The exposition is <span class="ital">regulated</span>, on the one hand, by the symbol of Daniel; on the other, by the parallel descriptions in the Apoc. itself (ch. <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a> sqq.; ch. 17). But with what freedom and independence John both has, in ch. 13, fashioned the features derived from the Danielian symbol into a new picture, and also in ch. 17 again presented them differently from ch. 8, must be shown by the explanation of the details, which has thus to seek a decision of the controversy of expositors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης</span>. The ordinary exposition makes its work too easy by immediately allegorizing the rising of the beast from the sea: “The beast rose from the disordered life of this world which surges in an ungodly way, viz., from the sea of nations.”[3218] The proper representation of the visionary locality is so little respected by this, that even in the statement <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠῚ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἌΜΜΟΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΑΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, 12:18, a symbolical designation of numberless[3219] masses of people has been found. But as, e.g., <a href="/revelation/12-1.htm" title="And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars:">Revelation 12:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΡΑΝΌς</span></span></span>, in which the woman and the dragon appear to the seer, signifies nothing else in a symbolical way than the expression declares, so in this passage, especially, nothing further is represented than that the first beast rises out of the sea, on whose visible shore the dragon had just placed himself, while the second beast is beheld in the vision coming from the actual earth (<a href="/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.">Revelation 13:11</a>). But it is a further question as to whether a particular reference lies in this statement of place, which[3220] follows not so much from the symbol of Daniel 7, and from <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm" title="And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.">Revelation 17:5</a>, as rather from the parallelism of <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.">Revelation 13:11</a>, where the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς Γῆς</span></span></span> has in fact an inner relation (<a href="/revelation/13-12.htm" title="And he excercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.">Revelation 13:12</a>). It results also, in general, from the mutual connection of the two beasts, and especially from the analogy of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς Γῆς</span></span></span>, that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς ΘΑΛΆΣΣΗς</span></span></span> must have a similar relation. De Wette, therefore, is already in error, when he conjoins the rising out of the sea, and the coming out of the abyss (<a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>), as though the beast were designated by the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΑΛΆΣΣΗς</span></span></span> as “a birth from the kingdom of darkness,” or even as one (Nero) returning from the realm of death.[3221] Ewald’s opinion, also, that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΑΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> designates the <span class="ital">insular</span> government of the Roman beast,[3222] is remote, and makes too much of an irrelevant point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the other beast rises from the earth, as from its own element and province, in order to corrupt the earth and those who dwell thereon, and to seduce to the worship of the first beast, so the first beast rises[3223] out of the sea, which surrounds the whole earth, in order to rule over all who dwell within the boundaries of its sphere,—over the whole earth (<a href="/revelation/13-4.htm" title="And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who is able to make war with him?">Revelation 13:4</a>), and all that dwell on the earth (<a href="/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a>), over all tribes and peoples (<a href="/revelation/13-7.htm" title="And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.">Revelation 13:7</a>). The sea, whereby the earth itself is surrounded, appears in like manner as a more remote province of the first beast rising from the same, as this beast himself properly rules, and the second beast only serves him. The two beasts appear throughout, not as two rulers by the side of one another, as if possibly to the first belonged only the sea without the earth, and to the second, on the other hand, the earth; but the power and dominion over the whole earth are given the first beast; while the second beast works on the earth and upon its inhabitants, only in the service of the first. This relation expresses itself also in the fact that the first beast comes forth from the sea itself surrounding the earth. The analogy of the contrasted <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γῆς</span> (<a href="/revelation/13-11.htm" title="And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.">Revelation 13:11</a>) forbids us to regard the <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θαλάσσης</span> as the sea of nations;[3224] but this mode of exposition cannot be justified by an appeal to <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm" title="And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.">Revelation 17:15</a>, since there is no contrast in that passage between sea and earth; and, also, the sea is not once mentioned, but the <span class="greekheb">ῦδατα πολλά</span>, on which the harlot sits. The entire view there is thus different.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3218] Victorin., Beda, Andr., C. a Lap., Coccej., Boss., Stern, Hengstenb., Ebrard, Klief., etc.; cf. also Grot.: “From the power of the empire,” so that “the public origin” of this beast is indicated in contrast with “the private origin” of the other. Beng.: “From Europe.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3219] Cf. <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm" title="And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.">Revelation 20:8</a>. Hengstenb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3220] Against Hammond and Eichh., who find only some sort of visionary locality designated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3221] Against De Wette (cf. also Volkm., Ew. ii.), it is asserted only that the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης</span> does <span class="ital">not</span> give the idea of <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς αβύσσου</span>. Independent of this is the opinion also defended by De Wette, that the beast from the abyss (<a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>) is essentially identical with the beast from the sea (<a href="/revelation/13-7.htm" title="And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.">Revelation 13:7</a>); for that the different turns in the representation rest upon essentially the same foundation, is shown in ch. 17.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3222] “Transmarine Rome, or that situated on the island of Italy.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3223] <span class="greekheb">ἀναβαῖνον</span>, pres., as <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm" title="And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,">Revelation 7:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3224] Hengstenb., Hofm., etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐχον κέρατα δέκα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Hengstenb. properly emphasizes against Beng. the fact that the expression <span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span> has already in itself a bad secondary signification. The <span class="greekheb">ζῶα</span>[3225] could not be called <span class="greekheb">θηρία</span>. Already, in Daniel,[3226] the godless secular kingdoms appear in the forms of <span class="greekheb">θηρία</span>, and especially is the significant feature to be there[3227] observed, that just as the self-sufficient scorn of the Chaldaean king is punished by his brutalization, so, on the other hand, because of his repentance there were given to the beast, representing the Chaldaean empire, human feet and a human heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The more definite explanation of the <span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span> is afforded by what follows.[3228]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That John mentions first[3229] the ten horns, then the seven heads of the beast,—otherwise than in the parallel <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>,—could have its foundation in the fact,[3230] that at the rising of the beast the horns first became visible; but according to this consideration, it must be expected that then the further description, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κερἁτων αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δέκα διαδ</span>., immediately connects with the <span class="greekheb">κέρατα δέκα</span>, and it would be written <span class="greekheb">καὶ κεφαλὰς ἑπτὰ καὶ ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κεφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁνομα βλασφ</span>. As not only the order in which the ten horns and seven heads of the beast are mentioned, is different from that in the description of the dragon, who, nevertheless, in other respects bears essentially the same insignia, but the present description has in it something peculiar, in that here the ten diadems appear on the ten horns, while there (<a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>) the seven diadems appear on the seven heads of the dragon; the entire order in the particular points of the description, which also expresses something particular with respect to the heads of the beast, depends upon a deeper foundation, lying especially in the significance of the form of the beast. If it is denied that the <span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span> designates the precise form of the antichristian secular power which this has attained in the Roman Empire,[3231] the explanation of itself indicates arbitrary guessing: the ten horns and seven heads—which are generally interpreted in reverse order—may then be understood as representations of the seven periods of the world, and of a tenfold division of the government of the world;[3232] of the seven kings before the appearance of antichrist;[3233] of the seven secular powers, viz., the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldaean, Medo-Persian, Greek, Roman, and the final still future power with its ten divisions;[3234] of the seven persecutions of Christians;[3235] of the seven powers hostile to Christianity, corresponding to the seven periods of N. T. history, and of the seven small powers[3236] combined with antichrist. But even the expositors who have referred the <span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span> to Rome have not always been able to give a definite and intelligible meaning to the particular features of the Apocalyptic image. This applies not only to those to whom the essential tendency of ch. 13[3237] appears to pertain to the Papacy,[3238] but also to those who properly abide by heathen Rome, as the form of the antichristian secular power contained within the horizon of the prophet. If, by a superficial comparison with <a href="/revelation/17-9.htm" title="And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.">Revelation 17:9</a>, the seven heads of the beast are interpreted of the seven hills of Rome,[3239] the explanation of the ten horns by “the ten servant kings”[3240] is manifestly utterly out of place; Ewald also, who refers the seven to the Roman emperors, and the ten to the prefects of the provinces, ignores the inner connection and essential relationship which exists already, according to <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/revelation/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>. His ten horns first become visible. The prophet has shifted the diadems from the heads to the horns (thereby altering their number, of necessity), since he wishes to stamp the heads (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Roman emperors, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Sib. Or. iii. 176; Tac. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> xv. 47) with the blasphemous names. Hence the ten horns (successive monarchs in the Danielic oracle) are superfluous here, except as an archaic, pictorial detail in the sketch of this polycephalous brute. Such grotesque, composite monsters were familiar figures in Persian and Babylonian mythology. The blasphemous title of <span class="ital">divus</span>, assumed by the emperors since Octavian (Augustus = <span class="greekheb">σεβαστός</span>) as a semi-sacred title, implied superhuman claims which shocked the pious feelings of Jews and Christians alike. So did <span class="greekheb">θεός</span> and <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ υἱός</span> which, as the inscriptions prove, were freely applied to the emperors, from Augustus onwards. The imperial system, especially with its demand for imperial worship, appeared the embodiment of irreverence and profane infatuation (<a href="/revelation/13-6.htm" title="And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.">Revelation 13:6</a>). This calm usurpation of divine honours was inexplicable except on the supposition (<a href="/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.">Revelation 13:2</a>) that the empire was a tool or agent of the devil himself.

But this seems far-fetched: it is better to remember (see on <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm" title="And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.">Revelation 4:7</a>) that God is not obliged always to reveal the same truth under the same image. St John’s vision was like enough to Daniel’s to indicate that it applied to the same thing, but it supplied details which Daniel’s did not. For one thing, comparing this description with <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>, we learn that this beast has a special likeness to the Devil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the name</span>] Read, <span class="bld">names</span>, as in the margin.

But because a new part begins at the words, <span class="ital">and stood</span>, and at the beginning of this part the name of the dragon is not again expressed, this act of standing is better applied to John. Who indeed, though he saw such various objects, yet mentions no other going of his, except that which was done in the spirit, for instance, ch. <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm" title="For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.">Revelation 18:3</a> : but this standing also upon the sand of the sea, was done in vision. This vision is very remarkable, and hence John mentions his own standing upon the sand of the sea.

The first was in Persia: the second proceeded from the Euphrates: the third, under the dragon, is sustained by the beast in the west. In the conclusion of my German commentary, I have enumerated more than forty laws and distinguishing marks of Apocalyptic interpretation. In these the quick unfolding of the three woes, and especially of the third woe, has no little weight.—<span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">a beast, etc</span>.) <span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span> is a diminutive in sound, but not in sense: for even elephants are called <span class="greekheb">θηρία</span>; and in Homer <span class="greekheb">μάλα μέγα θηρίον</span> is a great stag slain by Ulysses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The most ancient fathers determined that the <span class="ital">seven heads</span> of the beast were so many ages or kingdoms of the world, from its beginning to the end: from which interpretation that of D. <span class="ital">Gebhard</span> is not far removed, according to which the beast of the Apocalypse is the abuse of political power, the prop of the antichristian state: the seven heads, Pharaoh, Jeroboam, Assyrian Babel, Antiochus, the Sanhedrim of the Pharisees, then the Emperor of Rome, and the beast from the abyss. See Comm. on Twelve Prophets, pp. 508–524: comp. p. 217 and those which follow, 292. On the other hand, <span class="ital">Victorinus</span> took the head, or one king, to relate to Domitian, who was emperor in the time of John: the others, to refer to his five individual predecessors, and his immediate successor; and so Hammond, from Claudius to Domitian; so Bossuet refers it to Maximin and his five consorts, whom he himself survived, and Licinius, who alone survived him: which also is not far removed from the Epilysis of Raph. Eglinus. The one interpretation is too <span class="ital">loose;</span> the other too <span class="ital">confined</span>, although it is more convenient, inasmuch as it does not go beyond the seven hills [of Rome]. From either interpretation they were able to take an occasion, who with great agreement among themselves refer those seven heads to seven forms of the Roman polity, which are presented (see especially Borrhaus on this passage) by 1) Kings, 2) Consuls, 3) Decemvirs, 4) Military tribunes with consular power, 5) Dictators, 6) Emperors. We shall presently see the seventh. But, I. Seeing that Daniel, to whose antiquity it was suitable, already in his time sufficiently described the Roman affairs, what need is there to seek them in the Apocalypse, and to trace them back, not only beyond the beginnings of the third woe, but even from the beginnings of the fourth beast of Daniel, and indeed much further? for Daniel only subjoins the fourth beast to the third, as he does the third to the second, and the second to the first: but they who make the first head of the Apocalyptic beast to be the kings of Rome, ascend beyond the whole of the third beast of Daniel; whereas even the last king and the first consuls at Rome coincide with the beginnings of the second beast, that is, the Persians. II. The number seven, as applied to the heads, is itself at fault in this view; nor can consuls, decemvirs, and tribunes, be reckoned as three heads, but they must be regarded either as one, and this number of colleagues does not vary the species of rule, or as about twenty; moreover the others were often placed at intervals between the consuls; or if by this insertion the number of the forms is not increased, even kings (that you may class dictators with which division you please), together with emperors, would have to be reckoned as one head. Undoubtedly chronologists name the Roman epochs only from kings and consuls, and make other things subordinate to these, until they come to the emperors. See Com. de Sylvestris Chronol. p. 190, etc. However it be, it is not only from a difference between the heads, and from the number of the seven kings, that the beast and his last head are known; although interpreters allege that one means only: but without circumlocutions of this kind the prophecy more plainly represents both the whore, and with her the beast. III. To the seventh head alone <span class="ital">a short space</span> of continuance [ch. <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>] is ascribed; but who, according to this system, will make a longer continuance to the other heads; for instance, if the decemvirs are a head, when Tacitus, in the introduction to his annals, asserts that their power did not prevail more than two years? IV. When they come to the emperors, as if it were the sixth head, their ingenuity exerts itself in a variety of ways, as to which of the emperors is to be regarded as the last in this point of view: Is it Domitian, whom foreign emperors began to succeed; or Diocletian, in whom Paganism ended; or Constantine, who ought (to accord with their theory) to have remained a “short space,” namely, at Rome; or Augustulus, conquered by Odoacer? V. In the <span class="ital">seventh</span> head they do not escape the difficulty of introducing a too long continuance of it, and a too great difference between it and the eighth, which is nevertheless of the seven; as when they refer to this head Constantine, who was the first to have the seat of empire in the east; or Odoacer and the Heruli, together with the Goths and Longobards; or Boniface III. or Charlemagne, with the successors of both. More things suitable for the refutation of such opinions, if it is necessary, can be taken from those things which follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For in this place especially my German <span class="ital">Exegesis</span>, and the Epicrisis of <span class="ital">Lange</span>, are to be compared with one another. And, first of all, it should be agreed upon what is the subject of inquiry. We both admit, I. That <span class="ital">the beast</span> is one person, and <span class="ital">the whore</span> another: II. That <span class="ital">Babylon</span> is Rome, and that too especially in the last part of her time: III. That some things which are spoken of the beast in the Apocalypse, are also spoken of the fourth beast in <span class="ital">Daniel:</span> IV. That the beast is described both as a <span class="ital">body</span> and as an <span class="ital">individual:</span> V. That the <span class="ital">Papacy</span> also is pointed out in the Apocalypse: VI. That the impious one, who is called <span class="ital">antichrist</span>, is an individual. But the chief difference consists in this, that the Divine of Halle says that the <span class="ital">Papacy</span> is held forth under the picture of <span class="ital">Babylon;</span> I maintain, that it is under the description of the <span class="ital">beast</span>, and this in such a manner, that its heads denote the papal <span class="ital">succession</span> from 11th century, and in the last time that Wicked <span class="ital">one</span> [<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>], at once both wields the Papacy, inasmuch as he is of the seven, and adds new malignity from the bottomless pit, inasmuch as he himself is the eighth. <span class="ital">Very great weight therefore is attached by us to this part of the prophecy, the event of which belongs to the present day</span>. First of all, I will repeat the PROPOSITIONS which are laid down in that Exegesis on this passage, and which are examined in the Epicrisis, and I will partly explain them more fully, and partly vindicate them. I will act carefully and plainly: do you, Reader, if you judge that it at all concerns you (and it does greatly concern you), see that you attend to me. For it is wretched, when in an important matter there is much of words, but no profit. He who shall, word by word, weigh in turns that treatise of mine on each Proposition, and the Epicrisis of Lange, and shall compare my present explanation with both, will not repent of his labour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PROPOSITION 1. <span class="ital">It is one and the same beast, having ten horns and seven heads, which is described</span>, Revelation 13, 17.—D. Lange concedes this, p. 376. But when I had prepared this Proposition with this intention only, that the demonstration about to be then deduced from ch. 13 and 17 jointly might cohere, he, before I say anything about the whore, immediately anticipates me, and says, <span class="ital">that in</span> <span class="ital">Revelation 13, 17</span> <span class="ital">the beast is so brought forward as to destroy</span> [ch. <a href="/revelation/17-16.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.">Revelation 17:16</a>] <span class="ital">the whore</span> OR PAPACY. He adds, <span class="ital">or Papacy</span>, from his own theory. That the beast is different from the whore, each of us, as I have said, equally admits: but before the question is decided respecting the texts which signify the <span class="ital">Papacy</span>, it is neither allowable for me to put the <span class="ital">Papacy</span> for the <span class="ital">beast</span>, nor for him to put it for the <span class="ital">whore</span>. A perpetual error, arising out of <span class="ital">Homonymia</span> (see Append.), prevails throughout the Epicrisis. Do you, Reader, bear this in mind; for I shall not inculcate this at every passage. But for my part I shall proceed distinctly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PROP. 2. <span class="ital">The beast is an ecclesiastico-political power opposed to the kingdom of Christ</span>.—He concedes this also, p. 377. But when I opposed the opinion of some, who regarded the beast as a power either purely spiritual, or purely political (against the opinion of D. Lange), and when I did not as yet assume it as applying to the Papacy, he protests against my taking it of the Papacy. He ought to have waited, until, in the course of my argument, I seemed to abuse this Proposition which is agreed upon on both sides.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PROP. 3. <span class="ital">The beast has an intimate and altogether peculiar connection with the city of Rome</span>.—The Epicrisis, p. 377, so concedes this Proposition, as to say that it does not even need <span class="ital">proof:</span> and yet, p. 378, it refuses to it even <span class="ital">probability</span> itself, inasmuch as the beast and Rome are not therefore the same. But I do not say that they are the same, any more than he does Things connected are not the same: and I have proved the connection by reference to the 17th chapter, not because I thought that it is denied at the present day, but in order that this Proposition, together with the 4th, might more firmly support the 5th.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PROP. 4. <span class="ital">The beast exists at the present time</span>.—I had required that these Propositions might be examined as strictly as possible. The Divine of Halle has examined them, but, as he says, <span class="ital">not strictly; for that it was not necessary:</span> p. 386. It certainly was necessary in this Proposition, on account of the following Proposition; an examination of which I had particularly sought for, and that justly. I will speak with kindness and openness (for truth, which is brought into danger in this serious passage, compels me). <span class="ital">The Epicrisis does not relate to its readers, of whom it certainly has many, on account of the celebrity of the Author, what ought especially to have been related</span>. The whole of what he says is this: <span class="ital">This Proposition rests upon the preceding one. But since that is entirely without foundation, namely, that the beast is the Papacy, this falls to the ground together with it:</span> p. 377. The strong expressions, <span class="ital">entirely, falls to the ground</span>, and others, which the assurance of his own opinion everywhere supplies to the Venerable Author, ought not to prevent the reader from hesitating, and weighing in turn the arguments which each of us advances. There is need both of this admonition, and that it should be kept in mind. I had thus proved the Proposition: <span class="ital">The beast has not yet passed: for Rome stands, and it is not until the destruction of this city that the beast perishes. It is not therefore altogether</span> FUTURE: <span class="ital">for the second woe has now long ago passed; but this having passed away, the third woe was quickly coming, and at the beginning of this woe the beast quickly arose out of the sea. Therefore the beast, whatever it is, exists at the present day</span>. I have not, as he says, built up the 4th Proposition on the preceding one, although it satisfied the Divine of Halle and myself; much less does the 4th Proposition owe its force to this Proposition, <span class="ital">the beast is the Papacy</span>, which, though true of itself, he without cause makes equivalent to the preceding Proposition: for it would be an unbecoming circle, compared with the 5th Proposition: least of all does the 4th Proposition rest on that Proposition <span class="ital">only</span>, for the Epicrisis mentions it only. My proof holds good. 1) The beast has not yet passed: 2) it is not altogether FUTURE: 3) therefore it exists at present. <span class="ital">The fourth</span> point is not given: the Divine of Halle admits <span class="ital">the first:</span> from the first and the second <span class="ital">the third</span> necessarily follows: and that altogether overthrows the opinion of Lange respecting the beast, and supports mine. I proved <span class="ital">the second</span> point, as I was bound, by few words, but still from the whole connection of the prophecy, which cannot escape the notice of a continuous reader of the commentary brought down to that point (for it requires a reader of such a character). Do you seek for a summary of the arguments drawn from an analysis of the times? See <span class="ital">Erkl. Offenb</span>. p. 114. Do you prefer a summary of the arguments separated from an analysis of the times? See the same, p. 92, etc. The Epicrisis ought to have related and examined these things, rather than, in the very <span class="ital">central point</span> on which the controversy turns, to have attributed to me a solitary argument entirely destitute of weight, and, having easily refuted that, to have represented the matter as though quite settled in other respects.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PROP. 5. <span class="ital">The beast is the Roman Papacy</span>.—This in truth is the chief Proposition, respecting which the Epicrisis treats, p. 378. The 3d Proposition is beyond the reach of controversy: we have recently vindicated the 4th. This 5th Proposition, resting on those two, remains irrefutable, that is, evident and certain. The beast, I say, is intimately connected with the city <span class="ital">Rome:</span> and the beast exists <span class="ital">at the present day</span>. Therefore either another power of the present day, greater than the Pope and more intimately connected with the city Rome, must be pointed out, or the Pope must be regarded as the beast. I had spoken more at large on this very Proposition, p. 664; and the things which I had discussed, p. 659, are in agreement with this. <span class="ital">By the consideration of the three woes, and moreover of all the things which precede and follow in the prophecy and its accomplishment, we are so shut in, that neither before nor afterwards, neither in the east nor in the west, can we think of anything else than the Papacy. Let those things be compared which are set forth at</span> ch. <a href="/revelation/12-12.htm" title="Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.">Revelation 12:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm" title="And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.">Revelation 12:14</a>. Add the Introduction, especially § 31, 40, 42, 44, Numbers 12. All these strong points are as yet unrefuted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A further argument, with a special reference to Daniel, has been prepared by the illustrious man, recently, with the intention of convincing me: p. 393, etc., compared with pp. 381, 384. It is a pleasing task: I will consider the subject itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The argument proves, 1) That the beast of the Apocalypse is viewed, first, as an entire body, afterwards as an individual: 2) That the same belongs to the Roman monarchy: pp. 393, 394, 402, 403. I reply: I concede both points, even without the circuitous reasons sought from Daniel; and this very admission shall assist in proving the interpretation of the beast as given by me. Let us see the points of importance separately.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1) Without perceiving this difference, which takes the beast first as an entire body, and afterwards as an individual, he says, that an error is at hand: p. 394. I reply: It is true that there is this difference; and even one <span class="ital">of greater distinctness</span> than appears to the Divine of Halle. Thence we shall see the origin of the error, in which he is involved, especially in Proposition 10.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2) He demonstrates, p. 934 (394?), etc., that there is a great <span class="ital">conjunction</span> between the <span class="ital">beast</span>, even taken as a whole, and the <span class="ital">whore</span> (and the Papacy). This he does excellently; if the interpretation respecting the Papacy were transferred from the whore to the beast.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3) <span class="ital">The concentrated demonstration</span>, as the Author calls it, by which it may be shown that the beast of the Apocalypse is not the Pope, consists of three reasons: pp. 396, 397. We will refute these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a</span>) He denies that I have proved my opinion by any facts. I reply: I have plainly proved it, and do prove it again and again, by this very Proposition in particular. We will afterwards examine the parts of the <span class="ital">text</span> separately. Nor have I deemed it necessary to interweave at any time anything contrary together with my demonstration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">b</span>) He says, that the whole force of my demonstration, that the beast is the Pope, is taken from the kingly state and lordship of the Popes; but that the papal hierarchy is brought forward under the form of the royal whore: p. 397. I reply: That this question, whether the kingdom of the beast or of the whore is the kingdom of the Pope, is not decided by the kingly state and lordship, which each of them has. It was befitting that the kingly state and lordship of the Popes should be pointed out; because <span class="ital">without</span> it the Papacy would not be the beast; but that the Papacy is the beast, has been before shown by other means.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">c</span>) He repeats, that the beast is a different person from the whore: the same passage, compared with pp. 371–374. I again and repeatedly grant the truth of this; but it does not show that the Pope is the whore.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>:4) The parallelism also between the prophecy of Daniel and that of the Apocalypse, subjoined by the Divine of Halle at the same place, so breaks the force of his opinion, that it corroborates mine<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/revelation/13-4.htm" title="And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who is able to make war with him?">Revelation 13:4</a>) The parallelism also between the prophecy of Daniel and that of the Apocalypse, subjoined by the Divine of Halle at the same place, so breaks the force of his opinion, that it corroborates mine. We will proceed distinctly, and by means of certain particular Observations we shall see this 5th Proposition resulting again afresh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Obs.</span> 1. <span class="ital">The beast of the Apocalypse bears a resemblance to the fourth beast</span> of <a href="/context/daniel/7-7.htm" title="After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns....">Daniel 7:7-8</a>.—The Epicrisis enumerates many points of resemblance, pp. 398–402. Among these the very title, <span class="ital">the beast</span>, which is common to both, is conspicuous: <span class="ital">the ten horns;</span> great <span class="ital">power; duration</span> even until the kingdom of Christ and the saints. Of <span class="ital">the mouth speaking great things</span>, of <span class="ital">the war with the saints</span>, of <span class="ital">the</span> 3½ <span class="ital">times</span>, we shall speak below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Obs.</span> 2. <span class="ital">The dissimilarity also is remarkable</span>.—There are some things which Daniel alone mentions: its formidable appearance, great strength, teeth of iron, difference from the former beasts, the little horn, its eyes which are those of a man, the three horns torn out, nails of brass, etc. Again there are many things in the Apocalypse which are new: seven heads (when there is only one in <a href="/daniel/7-20.htm" title="And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.">Daniel 7:20</a>); a name of blasphemy; the resemblance of the beast itself, its feet and mouth to the third, the second, and the first beast in Daniel; the assistance given by the dragon; the “deadly wound” and its “healing;” the “wondering” of the earth; the “worship” of the inhabitants of the earth; the woman seated upon it; the ascent from the bottomless pit, etc. The ten horns themselves are described in one way by Daniel, in another by John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Obs.</span> 3. <span class="ital">The beast is not entirely the same</span>.—The Divine of Halle thinks that it is the same; but similar things are not always the same, dissimilar things even more rarely so; and identity is inconsistent with such a dissimilarity as here exists, as far as relates, for instance, to the heads.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Obs.</span> 4. <span class="ital">The beast of the Apocalypse has its rise many ages later than that of Daniel</span>.—It is doubted, whether the fourth beast of Daniel is the <span class="ital">Græco-Syrian</span> kingdom, or the <span class="ital">Roman</span> empire. Each theory is laid down by no mean interpreters; the former, for instance, by Franc. Junius, the latter by J. Lange. Take the Roman empire, and fix its rise as late as possible, under Augustus, who gained possession of Egypt, the last kingdom of the Grecian monarchy. That was, I will not say before the birth of John, but before his vision.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Moreover vision and prophecy belong to future events: whence, although the Babylonian monarchy, in the time of the prophet Daniel, was in the midst of its flourishing state; yet in the vision its beginnings, as it were abruptly, are derived from the time then present: <a href="/daniel/2-38.htm" title="And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.">Daniel 2:38</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-17.htm" title="These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.">Daniel 7:17</a>. It is therefore certain that the beast of Daniel has an origin more ancient than that of the Apocalypse. But the order of John’s vision demonstrates that it arose <span class="ital">after</span> the departure of the second woe, namely, the Saracenic, and under the trumpet of the seventh angel, <span class="ital">after</span> the circumstances relating to the dragon mentioned in ch. 12, under the third woe, after the departure itself of the dragon to carry on war with the remnant of the seed of the woman. Lange, in his Germ. Comm. on the Apoc. fol. 92, observes, on ch. <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>, that <span class="greekheb">πεπτωκότα</span> in the past, not <span class="greekheb">πίπτοντα</span> in the present, is said of the star: although we are not now inquiring respecting the time itself of the star which fell there. It is not less worthy of observation, that here <span class="greekheb">θηρίον</span> is described, on the other hand, as <span class="greekheb">ἀναβαῖνον</span> in the present, not <span class="greekheb">ἀναβεβηκὸς</span> in the perfect. The ascent of the beast out of the sea is under the third woe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Obs.</span> 5. <span class="ital">The beast of the Apocalypse is the Roman Papacy</span>. This flows by an inevitable sequence from the preceding observations. Nor do the reasons, which the Divine of Halle proposes from Daniel and the Apocalypse conjointly, present any impediment to this, whether they be drawn from the Apocalypse alone, or from Daniel also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">α</span>) <span class="ital">The beast</span>, he says, <span class="ital">is such an individual, as possesses no successors in his kingdom: inasmuch as the kingdom is destroyed together with the destruction of the beast. But the Popes have successors in their hierarchy</span>.—Epicr. p. 403. I reply: The last individual in that succession, as we shall see in Proposition 10, has no successor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">β</span>) <span class="ital">The beast arises from the stock of the princes</span> (<span class="ital">Regenten-Stamm</span>) <span class="ital">of the Roman monarchy: but no Pope arose from thence:</span> at the same place. I reply: It does not appear, whether the Epicrisis speaks of the <span class="ital">stock of princes</span> in a <span class="ital">genealogical</span>, or <span class="ital">political</span> sense. In a <span class="ital">genealogical</span> sense, the emperors themselves were of such a varied stock, that many pontiffs are with greater right considered to be of the <span class="ital">Roman</span> stock, than, for instance, Trajan himself. In a <span class="ital">political</span> sense, whatever power the Pope has, he has it from the monarchy, not from the hierarchy, <span class="ital">of Rome</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γ</span>) <span class="ital">The beast is still future: the Popes have already long reigned:</span> the same. I reply: The last Pope, a remarkable person, most wicked, is still future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δ</span>) <span class="ital">The beast will obtain kingdoms with the greatest political empire:</span> p. 404. I reply: The Popes have obtained them, and an individual Pope in his last time will obtain them much more.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ε</span>) <span class="ital">The beast will be cast into the lake of fire: Babylon will first be destroyed by the beast itself. Therefore Babylon is not the beast:</span> the same. I reply: I grant this, without any injury to the Proposition. We have cleared out of the way, as I think, the more copious argument: now we return to the Propositions, the tenth of which will more fully illustrate this fifth, even as far as relates to Daniel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PROP. 6. <span class="ital">This Papacy, or papal kingdom, began long since</span>.—By this Proposition I do not attempt to prove, <span class="ital">that the Pope is the beast</span>, as the Epicrisis relates, p. 378. That has been proved up to this point. Now, that point being settled, the progress of the legitimate demonstration demands, that it should be shown that there is found in the Papacy such a power as is ascribed in the prophecy to the beast, in preference to that which is ascribed to the whore; and that there should be an investigation, as to the particular time at which it arose. Wherefore the arguments which I had collected for this Proposition, are especially to the purpose. The beast is opposed to Christ, not with reference to His Person, but with reference to His <span class="ital">kingdom:</span> and here that must especially be considered, which the venerable Lange excellently teaches in the Preface to Sherlock’s Antidote against Popery, that the doctrine concerning the Person of Christ retained more soundness, on account of the Œcumenical Councils; but that the doctrine respecting the office and <span class="ital">kingdom</span> of Christ was most openly and flagrantly corrupted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PROP. 7. <span class="ital">The founder of the papal kingdom is Hildebrand, or Gregory VII</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[134]) The Epicrisis distinguishes between the commencement of the kingdom and its height: p. 379. He especially traces back the commencement of the Papacy to Boniface III., whose <span class="ital">ecumenical</span> name I have not passed over, p. 462, comp. pp. 445, 446, 548; although Magnif. <span class="ital">Pfaffius</span> shows, in a peculiar dissertation, that the affair itself was not then great.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[134] the Alexandrine MS.: in Brit. Museum: fifth century: publ. by Woide, 1786–1819: O. and N. Test. defective.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[135]) The Epicrisis does not deny the height in Hildebrand, <span class="ital">in the same place:</span> But the height carries with it the decision, when any kingdom, after having overcome the former one, seizes upon the first place. See <span class="ital">Erkl. Offenb</span>. p. 675.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[135] the Vatican MS., 1209: in Vat. libr., Rome: fourth cent.: O. and N. Test. def.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[136]) The Epicrisis remarks, that in Proposition 6, and afterwards, I do not use the term, beast, but, the Papacy: p. 380. I reply: That is done according to the law of method; for Proposition 5 showed, that the beast is the Pope: now, as the demonstration advances, <span class="ital">the Pope</span>, from the predicate, becomes the subject, to which further predicates are joined in the Propositions which follow. Such terms ought not to be used promiscuously, while there is any point in question; but the question being decided, the style becomes more compressed, as we have observed on Proposition 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[136] Ephræmi Rescriptus: Royal libr., Paris: fifth or sixth cent.: publ. by Tisch. 1843: O. and N. T. def.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[137]) In this particular passage I have commended <span class="ital">Vitringa</span>, having well weighed his arguments and those of Lange. The one, in other places, regards as already fulfilled many things which still remain to be fulfilled; the other regards almost all things which are already fulfilled, as still to be fulfilled: I follow the middle and true course, together with the order of the text. Where Vitringa is in error, or defends an opinion which is true by arguments which are not true, and the Divine of Halle is either opposed to him or agrees with him, whether correctly or incorrectly, I look on as one not concerned. Wherefore he is not right in comparing my system of arrangement with that of Vitringa; p. 381. The epoch of Gregory indeed maintains its place, as demonstrated by Vitringa and by me. <span class="ital">The argument</span>, of which mention is made in the same place, has been refuted in Proposition 5. For that some new power was added to the Roman episcopate by the aid of Gregory VII., all have admitted, even they who were then alive, as also they who afterwards defended Rome: and that very addition of power established the beast, or a certain empire. The new Dicta of Gregory proclaim it: the new Acts proclaim it. These were the Dicta, or <span class="ital">Dictations</span> of the man:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[137] Bezæ, or Cantabrig.: Univ. libr., Cambridge: fifth cent.: publ. by Kipling, 1793: Gospels, Acts, and some Epp. def.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I stood upon the sand of the sea.</span> The Revised Version, agreeing with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C, Vulgate, Syriac, AEthiopic, Armenian, Victorinus, reads <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "he stood." The Authorized Version follows the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I stood," which is found in B, P, Coptic, Andreas, Arethas. Fortunately, the point is not important. Whether St. John or the dragon stood on the edge of the sea is not material, since we are distinctly told that the ten-horned beast rose from the sea. Wordsworth aptly contrasts this station on the unstable sand in proximity to the sea, the clement of commotion, with the vision of the Lamb on Mount Zion (<a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-5</a>). The imagery which follows is founded upon the vision of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. The phrase should probably be joined on to the preceding passage, as in the Revised Version. The new vision then opens in the customary manner with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "I saw," as in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4, 5, 6, 7</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And saw a beast rise up out of the sea</span>. Supply "I," and make this the beginning of the fresh paragraph (see above). The one beast here takes the place of the four beasts of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, and is distinguished by the characteristics of the first three (see on ver. 2). This beast arises from the <span class="accented">sea</span>, the second beast from the <span class="accented">earth</span> (see ver. 11). They are the instruments of the woe which is denounced against the <span class="accented">earth</span> and the <span class="accented">sea</span> in <a href="/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>. The <span class="accented">sea</span>, again, is the type of instability, confusion, and commotion, frequently signifying the ungovernable nations of the earth in opposition to the Church of God (cf. <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). Probably this is the beast referred to in <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, and (more fully) in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. It is the power of the world which is directed towards the persecution of Christians. Having seven heads and ten horns. Nearly every manuscript has, <span class="accented">having ten horns and seven heads.</span> The order is reversed in <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a> and Revelation 17:3; possibly the horns are mentioned first in this passage, because they are first seen as the beast rises from the sea. The essential identity of this beast with the dragon of <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a> is plainly shown. There Satan is described in his personal character; here he is described under the aspect of the persecuting power of the world. The symbolism is analogous to that found in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, where we may find the key to the interpretation. First, the <span class="accented">heads</span> signify dominion. The head is naturally looked upon as the chief, the controlling and guiding part of the body; that part to which all the members of the body are subject. This is the idea conveyed in <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a>. The third beast there is distinguished by the possession of four heads, and (we are immediately told) "dominion was given to it." <span class="accented">Seven</span>, as we have repeatedly seen, is the number typical of universality (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">seven, heads</span>, therefore, are symbolical of universal dominion. In the second place, <span class="accented">horns</span> are the type of power. Thus, in <a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, the beast which is distinguished by the possession of the horns is described as being "diverse from all the beasts that were before it." It was "dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it" (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>, etc.). The number <span class="accented">ten</span> is the sign of completeness; not of universality or totality, but of sufficiency and abundancy for the purpose in view (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>, the ten righteous wanting at Sodom; <a href="/exodus/27-12.htm">Exodus 27:12</a>, the ten pillars of the tabernacle; the ten commandments; the tithe; <a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">ten horns</span>, therefore, denote plenitude of power. The words of this passage thus signify that the beast should possess worldwide dominion and ample power. These are the qualities ascribed to the power which Satan now directs against the "seed of the woman." At the time of the writing of the Apocalypse, this power was evidently heathen Rome; but the meaning may be extended to embrace all the forms which this world opposition has assumed, whether Roman, Mohammedan, or Gothic, etc. It is consequently unnecessary, as it certainly seems fruitless, to attempt to interpret the <span class="accented">heads</span> and <span class="accented">horns</span> of individual nations and kings. In endeavouring to do so, many writers have imported into the description here given other details from Daniel, or deduced by themselves, for which there is no warrant in the narrative here supplied. For the same reason, it is useless to inquire into the disposition of the <span class="accented">ten horns</span> and <span class="accented">seven heads</span>; since the whole is a figure intended to convey certain ideas, and is not a description of an actual bodily form. <span class="cmt_word">And upon his horns ten crowns.</span> "Ten crowns;" <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, crowns denoting sovereignty; not <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the victor's wreath. The <span class="accented">crowns</span> upon the <span class="accented">horns</span> denote the sovereign nature of the power with which the beast is invested. The nations of the world who have persecuted the Church of God have the chief rule in this world. <span class="cmt_word">And upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</span> The plural <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "names," adopted by the Revised Version, is found in A, B, Vulgate, Coptic, Andreas, Primasius. Alford reads the singular <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P, Coptic, Andreas, Primasius. There is no article. Possibly each head bore a name, which was the same in each case, and which might therefore with equal propriety be described as <span class="accented">name</span> or <span class="accented">names.</span> "Upon his heads" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>); the accusative being used (as Afford suggests) because the action of inscription carries with it a tinge of motion. In the preceding clause we have the genitive Or; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, where the preposition denotes rest. We have no hint given as to what the <span class="accented">name</span> was; the nature only is indicated. St. John very possibly had in his mind the mitre of the high priest, upon the plate of which was inscribed, "Holiness to the Lord" (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). It is a "name of blasphemy;" that is, the worldly power, typified by this beast, denies the Divinity and might of the true God, and exalts itself above him. Bede, Hengstenberg, etc., see the fulfilment in the assumption by the Roman emperors of titles which belong rightly only to Christ - King of kings, Divus, etc. But the application is wider. As partial fulfilments of that which will never be completely fulfilled until the end of the world, we may mention Pharaoh, when he said, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?" (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>); Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a>.); Herod Agrippa (<a href="/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>); as well as those since St. John's time who have blasphemed by denying the existence or omnipotence of Christ. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/revelation/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beast (&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Properly rendered.
