For as faith draws near to him in the consideration and knowledge of him, in beholding his glory, in desire after him, gratitude to him, and delight in him; continually aspiring after a conformity to him, and longing to enjoy union and communion with him; so unbelief produces directly contrary effects, rendering the mind averse to approach God in these respects and for these purposes, disliking and shunning all intercourse with him. It is distinguished by some into negative and positive. Negative unbelief is wherever any believe not, or have not faith, because they have not yet had the means of believing, namely, the Scriptures, or the truths declared in them, as the heathen nations. Such, supposing they believe and lay to heart the truths of what is called natural religion, cannot be said to have in them an <span class="ital">evil heart of unbelief. </span>2d, Positive unbelief is where men believe not, though they enjoy the means of faith. This latter is here meant, and in it consist some of the highest workings of the depraved nature of man; it being, on many accounts, the greatest provocation of God that a creature can be guilty of. For it is an opposition to God in all the perfections of his nature, and in the whole revelation of his will. And therefore the gospel, which is a declaration of grace, mercy, and pardon, and which indeed condemns all sin, yet denounces final condemnation only against this sin, <span class="ital">he that believeth not shall be damned, </span><a href="/mark/16-16.htm" title="He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.">Mark 16:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe reader, the apostle’s caution against a heart of unbelief implies two things: 1st, That we take heed lest, through refusing to consider the evidence of the truth, or the goodness and excellence of the things proposed to be embraced by our faith, we should continue in our natural unbelief, and never attain faith. 2d, Lest we should reject or decline from the faith after it has been received, through neglect of the means which minister to its continuance and increase, namely, the word of God, prayer, Christian fellowship, the Lord’s supper, &c.; through yielding to the temptations of the devil, the world and the flesh, and to the love of sin; through unwatchfulness and the neglect of self-denial and mortification; through relapsing into our former habits, and imitating the spirit and conduct of the carnal and worldly part of mankind around us; — through fear of reproach, of ill-usage and persecution from those that are enemies to the truth and grace of God. As a powerful means to prevent this from being the case, the apostle adds, <span class="ital">exhort one another, </span>&c. — It is justly observed by Dr. Owen, that “many practical duties are neglected because they are not understood, and they are not understood because they are supposed to have no difficulty in them.” The duty of constant exhortation, that is, of persuading men to constancy and growth in faith, love, and obedience, to watchfulness and diligence in the ways of God, and attention to every duty which we owe to God, our neighbour, and ourselves, is the most important part of the ministerial office. It is, however, not confined to ministers: it must also be mutual among believers; and, in order to the right performance of it, the following things are necessary: 1st, A deep concern for one another’s salvation and growth in grace. 2d, Wisdom and understanding in divine things. 3d, Care that only words of truth and soberness be spoken, for only such words will be attended with authority, and have the desired effect. 4th, Avoiding those morose and severe expressions which savour of unkindness, and using words of mildness, compassion, tenderness, and love, at least toward such as are well- disposed, and desirous to know and do the will of God. 5th, Avoiding levity, and always speaking with seriousness. 6th, Attention to time, place, persons, occasions, circumstances. 7th, A suitable example in the persons exhorting, giving weight and influence to every advice that is given, in imitation of the apostle, who could say, <span class="ital">Be ye followers of me as I am of Christ. </span>8th, We must be unwearied in this duty, and exhort one another <span class="ital">daily; </span>and that not only in appointed meetings, but in every proper season, and on all fit occasions, whenever we happen to be in company one with another: and, lastly, <span class="ital">while it is called today </span>— While the season for doing it continues; and therefore <span class="ital">now, </span>without delay, the time for performing this duty being both very short and very uncertain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As a motive impelling to the practice recommended, the apostle adds, <span class="ital">lest any of you be hardened — </span>That Isaiah , 1 st, Rendered blind and insensible as to the nature, excellence, necessity, and importance of spiritual things: 2d, impenetrable to mercy or justice, promises or threatenings; to the word, providence, or grace of God; stubborn and irreclaimable: 3d, Abandoned, and finally given up of God to sin and its consequences. It should be well observed, that this awful effect is not usually produced suddenly, and all at once, but by slow degrees, and perhaps insensibly, just as the hand of a labouring man is wont gradually to contract a callousness. It is effected, the apostle says, <span class="ital">by the deceitfulness of sin, </span>probably first by yielding to, instead of resisting and mortifying, sinful dispositions and corrupt passions, which by degrees produce those sinful practices, which, 1st, Not only grieve, but quench and do despite to the Spirit of grace, and cause him to withdraw his influences from us. 2d, The mind becomes hereby indisposed, and averse to attend to, or to obey, the voice of God in his word or providence, to consider or to yield to his counsel and authority. Hereby, 3d, The conscience is stupified, the will, affections, and all the powers of the soul are preoccupied and engaged in the service of sin and Satan, of the world and the flesh. The apostle terms sin <span class="ital">deceitful, </span>because it promises the satisfaction it never yields: persuades us we may venture to yield a little to its solicitations, but need not go far; — that we may yield at this time, this once, but need not afterward; — that we may and can repent and reform when we will; — that God will not be extreme to mark little things; — and that he is merciful, and will not be so strict as ministers are wont to urge, in fulfilling his threatenings.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-13 Days of temptation are often days of provocation. But to provoke God, when he is letting us see that we entirely depend and live upon him, is a provocation indeed. The hardening of the heart is the spring of all other sins. The sins of others, especially of our relations, should be warnings to us. All sin, especially sin committed by God's professing, privileged people, not only provokes God, but it grieves him. God is loth to destroy any in, or for their sin; he waits long to be gracious to them. But sin, long persisted in, will make God's wrath discover itself in destroying the impenitent; there is no resting under the wrath of God. Take heed: all who would get safe to heaven must look about them; if once we allow ourselves to distrust God, we may soon desert him. Let those that think they stand, take heed lest they fall. Since to-morrow is not ours, we must make the best improvement of this day. And there are none, even the strongest of the flock, who do not need help of other Christians. Neither are there any so low and despised, but the care of their standing in the faith, and of their safety, belongs to all. Sin has so many ways and colours, that we need more eyes than ours own. Sin appears fair, but is vile; it appears pleasant, but is destructive; it promises much, but performs nothing. The deceitfulness of sin hardens the soul; one sin allowed makes way for another; and every act of sin confirms the habit. Let every one beware of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take heed, brethren - In view of the conduct of the rebellious Jews, and of their fearful doom, be on your guard lest you also be found to have had the same feelings of rebellion and unbelief. See to it, that under the new dispensation, and in the enjoyment of the privileges of the gospel, you be not found to manifest such feelings as shall exclude you from the heavenly world. The "principle" has been settled by their unbelief that they who oppose God will be excluded from his rest. That may be shown under all dispensations, and in all circumstances, and there is not less danger of it under the gospel than there was when the fathers were conducted to the promised land. You are traveling through a wilderness - the barren wilderness of this world. You are exposed to trials and temptations. You meet with many a deadly and mighty foe. You have hearts prone to apostasy and sin. You are seeking a land of promise; a land of rest. You are surrounded by the wonders of Almighty power, and by the proofs of infinite beneficence. Disobedience and rebellion in you will as certainly exclude you from heaven as their rebellion did them from the promised land; and as their great sin was unbelief, be on your guard lest you manifest the same.<p>An evil heart of unbelief - An evil, unbelieving heart. The word "unbelief" is used to qualify the word "heart," by a Hebraism - a mode of speech that is common in the New Testament. An unbelieving heart was the cause of "their" apostasy, and what worked their ruin will produce ours. The root of their evil was "a want of confidence in God" - and this is what is meant here by a heart of unbelief. The great difficulty on earth everywhere is a "want of confidence in God" - and this has produced all the ills that man has ever suffered. It led to the first apostasy; and it has led to every other apostasy - and will continue to produce the same effects to the end of the world. The apostle says that this heart of unbelief is "evil." Men often feel that it is a matter of little consequence whether they have faith or not, provided their conduct is right; and hence, they do not see or admit the propriety of what is said about the consequences of unbelief in the Scriptures. But what do they say about a want of confidence between a husband and wife?<p>Are there no evils in that? What husband can sleep with quietness on his pillow, if he has no confidence in the virtue of his wife? What child can have peace who has no confidence in a parent? How can there be prosperity in a community where there is no confidence in a bank, or an insurance office, or where one merchant has no confidence in another; where a neighbor has no confidence in his neighbor; where the sick have no confidence in a physician, and where in general all confidence is broken up between man and man? If I wished to produce the deepest distress in any community, and had the power, I would produce the same want of confidence between man and man which there is now between man and his Maker. I would thus take away sleep from the pillow of every husband and wife; every parent and child; and make every man wretched with the feeling that all the property which he had was insecure. Among people, nothing is seen to be productive of greater evil than a want of confidence or faith - and why should not the same evil exist in the divine administration? And if want of confidence produces such results between man and man, why should it not produce similar, or greater, miseries where it occurs in relation to God? There is not an evil that man endures which might not be alleviated or removed by confidence in God; and hence one great object of the Christian religion is, to restore to man his lost confidence in the God that made him.<p>In departing from the living God - Manifested in departing from him; or leading to a departure from him. The idea is, that such a heart of unbelief would be connected with apostasy from God. All apostasy first exists in the heart, and then is manifested in the life. They who indulge in unbelief in any form, or in regard to any subject, should remember that this is the great source of all alienation from God, and that if indulged it will lead to complete apostasy. They who wish to live a life of piety should keep the heart right. He that lives "by the faith of the Son of God" is safe; and none is safe but he. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

This exhortation is grounded upon the state and case of their ancestors before given, as a warning and caution to the then present Hebrews; and whom the apostle styles "brethren", to show that he had no hard thoughts of them, and that his jealousy was a godly one, and not an evil suspicion; and may teach us that all exhortations, admonitions, and reproofs should be given in love: <p>lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief; or such an evil heart, in which unbelief prevails, and is predominant: there is in every man, whether a profane sinner, or an hypocritical professor, an evil heart, and an unbelieving one; and there is unbelief in regenerate persons, which when cherished and encouraged by them is a great evil, and should be avoided; and this sin is aggravated by the many instances of God's grace, and by the many declarations of it, and by the exceeding great and precious promises God has made, and by the great discoveries of his love to their souls in times past: and this sin, when it gets ahead, has a very great influence on the heart, to make it evil; and unbelief was the first sin of man, at least it very early appeared; it is the mother sin, and puts persons upon every sin; it defiles the conscience, hardens the heart, renders the word unprofitable, unfit for duty and makes men unstable, and therefore to be shunned; and especially because of the dreadful effect following: <p>in departing from the living God; that is, from Christ, who is the Son over his own house, and whose voice is to be heard; for of no other is the apostle speaking in the context; and who is not only the Son of the living God, but he is himself the living God; he is life in himself, and is the fountain and author of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal. This is mentioned to exalt the person of Christ, the apostle and high priest of our profession; and to discover the greatness and heinousness of the sin of such as depart from him and his Gospel, and to deter men from it: there is a final and total departure from Christ, from his Gospel and ordinances, from his people, and from a former profession of faith, which is never to be found in true believers; for they are as Mount Zion, which can never be removed; but there is a partial departure, and for a while, which they are liable to, and is attended with bad effects to them, and should be guarded against: saints should take heed of themselves, and of their hearts, and of the unbelief of them, that they do not in the least depart from Christ, by letting go their hold of him, or by a non-exercise of faith upon him; and this should be the care and concern of every individual member of the church, and at all times; unbelief is very dishonourable to God and Christ; contradicts the word and promises of God; is uncomfortable to the saints; it is a sin that very easily besets, and is very provoking to God, and is highly resented by him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</span><p>(7) Now consider in the words of David, he shows first by this word today that we must not ignore the opportunity while we have it: for that word is not to be limited to David's time, but it encompasses all the time in which God calls us.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God....">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>.

What they are to be on their guard against is the emergence of <span class="greekheb">καρδία πονηρὰ ἀπιστίας ἐν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζῶντος</span>, a wicked heart of unbelief manifesting itself in departing from Him who is a living God. <span class="greekheb">ἀπιστίας</span> is the genitive of quality = a bad, unbelieving heart; whether the wickedness proceeds from the unbelief, or the unbelief from the wickedness, is not determined. Although, from the next verse it might be gathered that unbelief is considered the result of allowed sin: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, it is when the heart is hardened through sin, it becomes unbelieving, so that the psychological order might be stated thus: sin, a deceived mind, a hardened heart, unbelief, apostasy. The main idea in the writer’s mind is that unbelief in God’s renewed offer of salvation is accompanied by and means apostasy from the living God. In the O.T. Jehovah is called “the living God” in contrast to lifeless impotent idols, and the designation is suggestive of His power to observe, visit, judge and succour His people. In this Epistle it occurs, <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm" title="It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.">Hebrews 10:31</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>. To object that the apostasy of Jews from Christianity could not be called “apostacy from God” is to mistake. The very point the writer wishes to make is just this: Remember that to apostatize from Christ in whom you have found God, is to apostatize from God. It is one of the ominous facts of Christian experience that any falling away from high attainment sinks us much deeper than our original starting point.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Take heed, brethren, lest there be …</span>] It is evident that deep anxiety mixes with the warning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in any of you</span>] The warning is expressed indefinitely; but if the Epistle was addressed to a small Hebrew community the writer may have had in view some special person who was in danger (comp. <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm" title="Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.">Hebrews 10:25</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>).

That you may, if you are not careful, is shown by the very warning of the psalm, and by the example of your fathers, referred to in the psalm, <span class="accented">all</span> of whom, though called, failed of attainment through unbelief. It is implied all along that the "today" of the psalm includes the present day of grace, and points to a truer rest than that of Canaan, still offered to the faithful.

Here the future indicative which follows, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, denotes a fact in the future, distinctly apprehended as possible (cf. <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>). It had not ensued as yet, nor does the writer anticipate the probability of its being the case with <span class="accented">all</span> his readers; but in the state of feeling with regard to the gospel among the Hebrew Christians which the whole Epistle was intended to counteract, he <span class="accented">sees</span> ground for fearing it in the case of <span class="accented">some.</span> Their present wavering might result in apostasy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is not necessary to analyze the expression," an evil heart of unbelief," so as to settle whether the evil heart is regarded as the result of unbelief, or unbelief of the evil heart; the main point to be observed is that unbelief is connected with moral culpability, as is implied further in ver. 13. The unbelief so condemned in Holy Scripture is not mere intellectual incapacity; it is condemned only so far as man is responsible for it on account of his own willful perversity or carelessness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The outcome of such "<span class="accented">evil</span> heart of unbelief," if allowed to become fixed and permanent, will be apostasy (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: cf. <a href="/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>) from "the living God," from him who is Eternal Life and the Source of all life and salvation. The thought of the momentous consequence of the falling away of Christians after light enjoyed is prominent in the Epistle (see especially <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.; Hebrews 10:26, etc.). The expression," the living God," further directs attention to the revelation of God in the Old Testament, in which he is continually so designated, and to the thought that it is the same God who has revealed himself finally in the SON. Addressing Hebrew Christians, the writer may mean to say," In apostatizing from Christ you would be cutting yourselves off from the God of your whole ancestral faith." There <span class="accented">may</span> be an intended allusion, too, to the oath, already referred to, of <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21, 28</a>, the form of which in the original is," As I live" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Note how the following exhortation is colored by the O.T. citation: evil heart; the to-day; be hardened; take heed (&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;). See to it. Often in warnings or admonitions: sometimes with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; from, with genitive of that against which the warning is given, as <a href="/mark/8-15.htm">Mark 8:15</a>; <a href="/mark/12-38.htm">Mark 12:38</a>; but so only in the Gospels.
