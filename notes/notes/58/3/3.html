In this passage it signifies the forming a church, or religious society, by bestowing on it privileges, and by giving it laws for the direction of its members. And, as the apostle is speaking of the forming of the Christian Church, his meaning is, that Jesus, who formed the Christian Church, is a more honourable or greater person than all the members of that church collectively; consequently greater than any particular member of it. By making this observation, the apostle intimated that Moses, being a member of the Jewish Church, which he formed as God’s servant, and needing its services and privileges equally with the Israelites, he was not to be compared with Jesus, who by his own authority had erected and supported the church in all ages and places, and had need of none of the privileges or services of the church which he had formed. <span class="ital">For every house is builded by some man — </span>As the discourse is not concerning a material edifice, but concerning the Jewish and Christian Churches, <span class="ital">every house </span>must mean <span class="ital">every church </span>or <span class="ital">religious society; </span>perhaps also every community, state, or government righteously established, is included in this general expression. <span class="ital">But he that built all things </span>— Or <span class="ital">all these things, </span>as Beza renders the expression, namely, the whole church, and all the persons that belong to it, or the parts of it, in all ages; the expression <span class="ital">all things </span>being properly restrained to the subject treated of, and the word used by the apostle to express the building of the house, plainly declaring that it is the same kind of building he is treating of, and not the absolute creation of all things, which is nowhere expressed by that word; <span class="ital">is God </span>— “The words may be so understood as to signify either <span class="ital">that God made or built all these things, </span>or <span class="ital">that he who made and built all these things is God; </span>the first sense making God the <span class="ital">subject, </span>the latter the <span class="ital">predicate </span>of the proposition. But as to our purpose, they amount to the same thing; for if he who made them is God, his making of them declares him to be so. And that it is the Lord Christ who is intended in this expression, will appear immediately; for, 1st, If God absolutely, or God the Father be intended, then by the building of all things, the creation of the world is designed; so they all grant who are of that opinion; but that this is not so, we have already demonstrated from the words themselves. 2d, The introduction of God absolutely, and his building of all things in this place, is no way subservient to the apostle’s purpose; for what light or evidence doth this contribute to his principal assertion, namely, that Christ was more honourable than Moses, and that on account of his building the house of God, the confirmation whereof he doth in these words expressly design? 3d, It is contrary to his purpose. For he doth not prove the Lord Christ to be deservedly preferred before Moses, unless he manifest that by his <span class="ital">own power </span>he built the house of God in such a manner as Moses was not employed in; whereas, according to this interpretation, he assigns the principal building of the house to <span class="ital">another, </span>even the Father, and so overthrows what he had before asserted. This then is that which by these words the apostle intends to declare; namely, the ground and reason whence it is that the house was or could be in that glorious manner built by Christ, even <span class="ital">because he is God, </span>and so able to effect it; and by this effect of his power he is manifested so to be.” — Owen.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this man - The Lord Jesus. The word "man" is understood, but there can be no doubt that he is referred to.<p>Was counted more worthy - Was more worthy; or is more worthy. The word used here does not refer to anything that had been said of him, or to any estimate which had been made of him.

Honor, dignity, regard. He really had a higher rank, and was worthy of more respect. This was saying much for the Messiah, and that it was proper to say this, Paul proceeds to show. He did not attempt in any way to undervalue Moses and his institutions. He gave him all the honor which the Jews were themselves disposed to render him. He admitted that he had been eminently faithful in the station where God had placed him; and he then proceeds to show that the Lord Jesus was entitled to honor superior to that, and that hence the Christian religion had more to attach its friends to it than the Jewish had.<p>Inasmuch as he who hath builded the house - The idea here is, either that he who is the maker of a house - the architect - is worthy of more respect than the house itself; or that he who is the founder of a family is worthy of more honor than the family of which he is the founder. It seems to me that the former is the meaning - for the latter is not always true. The founder of a family may be really deserving of much less respect than some of his descendants. But it is always true that the architect is worthy of more respect than the house which he makes. He exhibits intellect and skill. The house, however splendid, has neither. The plan of the house was drawn by him; its beauty, its proportions, its ornaments, are what he made them, and but for him they would not have existed. Michelangelo was worthy of more honor than "St. Peter's Cathedral" at Rome; and Sir Christopher Wren worthy of more than "St. Paul's Cathedral" at London. Galileo is worthy of more praise than the telescope, and Fulton more than a steam-engine. All the evidence of skill and adaptedness that there is in the invention had its origin in the inventor all the beauty of the statue or the temple had its origin in the mind of him that designed it. An author is worthy of more honor than a book; and he that forms a work of art is worthy of more respect than the work itself. This is the idea here. Paul assumes that all things owed their origin to the Son of God; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>,<a href="/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>. He was the author of the universe; the source of all wise and well-founded systems; the originator of the Jewish dispensation over which Moses presided. Whatever beauty or excellence there might have been, therefore, in that system, was to be traced to him; and whatever ability even Moses displayed was imparted by him. Christ is really the head of the family over which Moses presided, and has claims, therefore, to higher honor as such. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The Hebrew Christians admitted the fact (Heb 1:13).<p>builded the house&#8212;Greek, "inasmuch as He hath more honor than the house, who prepared it," or "established it" [Alford]. The Greek verb is used purposely instead of "builded," in order to mark that the building meant is not a literal, but a spiritual house: the Church both of the Old Testament and New Testament; and that the building of such a house includes all the preparations of providence and grace needed to furnish it with "living stones" and fitting "servants." Thus, as Christ the Founder and Establisher (in Old Testament as well as the New Testament) is greater than the house so established, including the servants, He is greater also than Moses, who was but a "servant." Moses, as a servant, is a portion of the house, and less than the house; Christ, as the Instrumental Creator of all things, must be God, and so greater than the house of which Moses was but a part.

Moses was counted worthy of glory and honour, and had it given him, both by God and by men; by God, as appears from the work he called him to, to deliver his people Israel, to reveal his mind and will to them, and to rule and govern them; and from the favours he showed him, as the miracles he did by him, the near converse he admitted him to, and the view he gave him of his glory, which he made to pass before him, and his regard to him at his death and burial, as well as the testimony he gave of him; and he was counted worthy of honour by men, and who gave it him, as Pharaoh and his people, and the Israelites. The Jews give very great commendations of him; they call him a father in the law, a father in wisdom, and a father in prophecy (u); and say, that he is the father, master, head, and prince of all the prophets (w); yea, the great prophet expected in the last days, they say, will be but next to Moses, their master (x): they observe, that there were more miracles wrought by, and for him, than were wrought by, and for all the prophets that have been since the world began (y); so that he not only exceeded them in the excellency and sublimity of prophecy, but in the multitude of miracles; but Christ is worthy of more glory than Moses, and has it given him by God, angels, and men: he is a greater Saviour than Moses; Moses was but a temporal saviour, but he is the author of spiritual and eternal salvation: he is a greater prophet than Moses, being the only begotten Son of God, who lay in the bosom of the Father, and has declared him, his mind and will, his Gospel, grace, and truth, as Moses never did: he is a greater King than he, being made higher than the kings of the earth: he did more miracles than Moses, and had a greater testimony from God than he had, as that he was his beloved Son, and to be heard; he was also raised, from the dead, and is set down at the right hand of God, and is appointed Judge of all; he is ministered to, and worshipped by angels, is believed on by men, who ascribe the whole glory of their salvation to him. <p>Inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house; this "house", or "temple", as the Arabic version renders it, is the church, of which Christ is the builder; though not to the exclusion of the Father and the Spirit, who are coefficient builders with him, nor of ministers of the Gospel as instruments, nor of believers in a private capacity, who build up one another; but he has the chief concern in the building, which lies in the conversion of souls, and in the edification of them, and is carried on by his Spirit in the ministry of the word and ordinances, and from hence he has a glory; see <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a> a greater glory than Moses, seeing he was but a part of this house, at most but a pillar in it; but Christ is the builder, foundation, and cornerstone. <p>(u) T.

Thus the Rabbis said that “the soul of Moses was equivalent to the souls of all Israel;” (because by the cabbalistic process called <span class="ital">Gematria</span> the numerical value of the letters of “Moses our Rabbi” in Hebrew = 613, which is also the value of the letters of “Lord God of Israel”).

This, rather than "the glory he had with the Father before the world was" (<a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), is suggested by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as well as by the drift of the preceding chapters. We may suppose also a reference, in contrast, to the transitory "glory" on the countenance of Moses (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), which is contrasted (<a href="/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>.) with the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in Christ. We observe, further, that in the latter part of the verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> is substituted for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, as more suitable to the mundane comparison of a house and its builder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> may include the idea of fitting up and furnishing a house as well as building it. But what is the drift of the intended argument? It is usual, with the Fathers generally, to suppose that Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is intended to be denoted as the Builder or Establisher of the house in which Hoses was a servant, and that the argument is that he, as such, is necessarily greater than the servant, who was but a part of the house, or household, thus established. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it is to be observed, may include in its meaning the <span class="accented">familia</span>, as well as the house itself, as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> may include the idea of constituting the whole establishment (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, "whose house we are"). Among moderns, Hofmann and Delitzsch deny this identification of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: against which there are the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The SON has not been represented so far in the Epistle as the <span class="accented">originator</span> of the economy of redemption. Notwithstanding distinct intimations of his eternal proexistent Deity (as in <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2, 10</a>), it has been as the Messiah, the Apostle and High Priest, manifested in time, and passing through humanity to glory, that he has been regarded in the preceding argument. Nor is there any proof here adduced of his being the <span class="accented">Builder</span> of the "house," so as to justify the conclusion on this ground of his glory being greater than that of Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("has been counted worthy of") suggests (as has been already remarked) refer once to the glory won by him, "on account of the suffering of death," rather than to his pristine glory as the Divine Builder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Elsewhere in the New Testament, when the Church is referred to under the figure of a house, it is spoken of as <span class="accented">God's</span> building (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-21.htm">Hebrews 10:21</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). It is never spoken of as Christ's. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The wording of ver. 3 does not necessitate the identification of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means "so far as;" it implies only that the glory of Christ is greater than that of Moses, <span class="accented">in proportion as</span> the honor of the builder is greater than that of the house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The identification increases the difficulty of understanding the relevance to the argument of ver. 4, of which more will be said presently. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> to denote God the Father, we may state the argument thus: God is the Builder, or Founder, of his own house. Christ has been already shown to be his SON, associated with him in dignity and power, and, as such, Lord over his Father's house. Moses, on the other hand, as appears from <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, was but a servant in God's house. As, then, the Founder is to the house, so is the Son and Lord to a servant in it; the Son partaking of the glory of the Founder; the servant only of that of the house in which he serves. According to this view of the argument, the premises have been established, and the conclusion follows; the relation of Christ to the Builder of the house has been set forth in the preceding chapter, and may be now assumed; that of Moses is sufficiently shown by the quotation from the Pentateuch. Thus also vers. 5 and 6 are found to carry out naturally the idea here introduced, instead of unexpectedly starting a different one. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was counted worthy (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Used both of reward which is due (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>) and of punishment (<a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a>).<p>Of more glory (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>Comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>.<p>Inasmuch as (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;' &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rend. by so much as. The argument is based on the general principle that the founder of a house is entitled to more honor than the house and its individual servants. There is an apparent confusion in the working out, since both God and Christ appear as builders, and Moses figures both as the house and as a servant in the house. The point of the whole, however, is that Moses was a part of the O.T. system - a servant in the house; while Christ, as one with God who established all things, was the founder and establisher of both the Old and the New Testament economies. </body></html>
