With him will I speak mouth to mouth.” The “house” or household is God’s. people Israel. To others will God reveal Himself in various ways in regard to the many parts of the house, the many concerns of the household. Throughout the whole house Moses was the recipient of the divine commands, and was faithful—“faithful” (as one of the Targums paraphrases), “as chief of the chiefs of my court.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who was faithful to him that appointed him </span>— The sacred penman, entering upon a comparison between Moses and Christ, as he was the apostle of God, or one sent by him to reveal his will, he recommends him to the faith of the Hebrews, under the principal qualification of a person in that office; he <span class="ital">was faithful, </span>which faithfulness he further describes by its respect to that act whereby he was appointed by God to the office. God’s apostle is the chief steward or dispenser of his mysteries; and it is principally required in stewards that a man be found faithful. Now the fidelity of a legate, ambassador, or apostle consists principally in the full declaration of the mind and will of him who sent him, as to those ends for which he is sent. <span class="ital">Faithfulness </span>respects <span class="ital">trust. </span>Our Lord, therefore, must have had a trust committed to him wherein he was faithful.

The words are an allusion to the testimony which God bare to Moses, <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>, <span class="ital">My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house. </span>It is true, Moses failed personally in his faith, and was charged of God that <span class="ital">he believed him not, </span><a href="/numbers/20-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.">Numbers 20:12</a>; but this was no impeachment of his faithfulness in the special office intended.

He did not conceal any of the divine laws, on account of their disagreeableness to the Israelites; nor did he alter them in the least, to make them acceptable, but delivered the whole law as it was spoken to himself, and formed the tabernacle and the ritual of the worship exactly according to the pattern showed him. In like manner, Christ’s faithfulness consisted in his teaching the doctrines, appointing the laws, and establishing the worship which his Father had ordained for the church.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 Christ is to be considered as the Apostle of our profession, the Messenger sent by God to men, the great Revealer of that faith which we profess to hold, and of that hope which we profess to have. As Christ, the Messiah, anointed for the office both of Apostle and High Priest. As Jesus, our Saviour, our Healer, the great Physician of souls. Consider him thus. Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be to us hereafter and for ever. Close and serious thoughts of Christ bring us to know more of him. The Jews had a high opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, yet his faithfulness was but a type of Christ's. Christ was the Master of this house, of his church, his people, as well as their Maker. Moses was a faithful servant; Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is rightful Owner and Sovereign Ruler of the Church. There must not only be setting out well in the ways of Christ, but stedfastness and perseverance therein to the end. Every meditation on his person and his salvation, will suggest more wisdom, new motives to love, confidence, and obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who was faithful - see the note, <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm">Hebrews 2:17</a>. He performed with fidelity all the functions entrusted to him.<p>To him that appointed him - Margin, "made." The word "made," however, is used in the sense of constituted, or appointed. The meaning is, that he was faithful to God. Perhaps Paul urges on them the necessity of considering "his fidelity" in order to keep "them" from the danger of apostasy. A leading object of this Epistle was to preserve those whom he had addressed from apostatizing from God amidst the temptations and trials to which they were exposed. In doing this, what could be a more powerful argument than to direct their attention to the unwavering constancy and fidelity of the Lord Jesus? The "importance" of such a virtue in the Saviour is manifest. It is seen everywhere; and all the great interests of the world depend on it. A husband should maintain inviolate fidelity toward a wife, and a wife toward her husband; a child should be faithful to a parent, a clerk and apprentice to his employer, a lawyer to his client, a physician to his patient, an ambassador to the government that commissions him.<p>No matter what may be the temptations in the way, in all these, and in all other relations, there should be inviolate fidelity. The welfare of the world depended on the faithfulness of the Lord Jesus. Had he failed in that, all would have been lost. His fidelity was worthy of the more attentive consideration from the numerous temptations which beset his path, and the attempts which were made to turn him aside from his devotedness to God. Amidst all the temptations of the adversary, and all the trials through which he passed, he never for a moment swerved from fidelity to the great trust which had been committed to his hands. What better example to preserve them from the temptations to apostasy could the apostle propose to the Christians whom he addressed? What, in these temptations and trials, could be more appropriate than for them to consider the example of the great apostle and high priest of their profession? What more proper for us now in the trials and temptations of our lives, than to keep that great and glorious example continually before our eyes?<p>As also Moses was faithful - Fidelity to God was remarkable in Moses. In all the provocations and rebellions of the Jews, he was firm and unwavering. This is affirmed of him in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, to which place the apostle here alludes, "My servant, Moses, is not so, who is faithful in all his house." The word "house," as applied to Moses, is used probably in the sense of "family," as it often is, and refers to the "family" over which he presided - that is, the Jewish nation. The whole Jewish people were a "household," or the family of God, and Moses was appointed to preside over it, and was faithful in the functions of his office there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Or "made him"; Christ, as man, was made, but not as God; nor is the apostle speaking of the divine nature of Christ, but of his offices: wherefore this phrase designs the constitution and settlement of him in office; which may take in the eternal appointment of him as Mediator; the open promise of him in time; his mission, unction, and attestation from God; and his manifestation and declaration as such, at his ascension and session at God's right hand, when he was made Lord and Christ. Now, as Mediator, he had a trust reposed in him; as the persons of all God's elect, and a fulness of all grace for them; the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and eternal life and happiness; and also the glory of God in their salvation: which trust he has faithfully discharged as an apostle, and high priest; in a declaration of the whole will of God; in acknowledging it was his Father's doctrine he brought, and in seeking not his own, but his Father's glory; in redeeming and saving the persons committed to him; in distributing his grace to them; and in bringing them safe to glory; and in taking care of things pertaining to God: <p>as also Moses was faithful in all his house; the passage referred to is in <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a> and which seems not so much to intend the fidelity of Moses in managing the affairs of God's house, as the largeness of the trust reposed in him, the dignity and honour conferred on him, and the power and authority he was invested with, in having the whole house of Israel committed to his care and charge, in which he exceeded all other prophets; and so the faithfulness of Christ is not so much to be understood of the discharge of his trust, as of the trust itself; and the sense is, that he was trusted much by God the Father, who constituted him Mediator, even as Moses was; and this sense best agrees with <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>.

For it is nothing more than a pronouncing upon the mind of the writer from the standpoint of the critic’s own ready-formed dogmatics.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>. The characteristic, or particular, qualification of Jesus which is to hold their attention is His trustworthiness or fidelity. <span class="greekheb">πιστὸν ὄντα</span> might be rendered “as being faithful”. The fidelity here in view, though indirectly to men and encouraging them to trust, is directly to Him who made Him, <span class="ital">sc</span>., Apostle and High Priest. <span class="greekheb">τῷ ποιήσαντι αὐτόν</span>. The objection urged by Bleek, Lünemann and Alford that <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span> can mean “appoint” only when followed by two accusatives is not valid. The second accusative may be understood; and in <a href="/1_samuel/12-6.htm" title="And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.">1 Samuel 12:6</a> we find <span class="greekheb">Κύριος ὁ ποιήσας τὸν Μωυσῆν καὶ τὸν Ἀαρών</span>, words which may have been in the writer’s mind. The Arian translation, “to Him that created Him,” is out of place. Appointment to office finds its correlative in faithfulness, creation scarcely suggests that idea. The fidelity of Jesus is illustrated not by incidents from His life nor by the crowning proof given in His death, nor is it argued from the admitted perfections of His character, but in accordance with the plan of the Epistle it is merely compared to that of Moses, and its superiority is implied in the superiority of the Son to the servant. He was faithful “as also Moses in all His house,” this being the crowning instance of fidelity testified to by God Himself, <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεράπων μου Μωυσῆς ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ μου πιστός εστι</span> (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>), where the context throws the emphasis on <span class="greekheb">ὅλῳ</span>. “The ‘house of God’ is the organised society in which He dwells” (Westcott), <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1 Timothy 3:15</a>. Weiss says that the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ</span> “necessarily belong” to <span class="greekheb">πιστὸν ὄντα</span>. This is questionable, because the writer’s point is that Jesus is faithful not “in” but “over” the house of God (<a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>. The reason is now assigned why Jesus and His fidelity should eclipse in their consideration that of Moses. The reason is that “this man” (<span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span>, “the person who is the subject of our consideration”) “has been and is deemed worthy of greater glory (‘amplioris gloriae,’ Vulg. <span class="greekheb">πλείονος</span>, qualitative as in <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>) than Moses, in proportion as he that built the house has more honour than the house.” The genitive follows the comparative <span class="greekheb">πλείονα</span>. The “greater glory” is seen in the more important place occupied by Him in the fulfilment of God’s purpose of salvation. This glory of Jesus is as much greater than that of Moses, as the cause is greater than the effect, the builder than the house. [The principle is stated by Philo (<span class="ital">De Plant.</span>, c. 16. In Wendland’s ed., ii. 147) <span class="greekheb">ὁ κτησάμενος τὸ κτῆμα τοῦ κτήματος ἀμείνων καὶ τὸ πεποιηκὸς τοῦ γεγονότος</span>, and by Menander and other comic poets as quoted by Justin (<span class="ital">Apol.</span>, i. 20) <span class="greekheb">μείζονα τὸν δημιουργὸν τοῦ σκευαζομένου</span>. Weiss, however, is of opinion that it is not a general principle that is being stated, but that <span class="greekheb">τοῦ οἴκου</span> refers directly to the house of God.] <span class="greekheb">ὁ κατασκευάσας</span> includes all that belongs to the completion of a house, from its inception and plan in the mind of the architect to its building and furnishing and filling with a household. Originally the word means to equip or furnish, <span class="greekheb">κατασκευάζειν τὴν οἰκίαν τοῖς σκεύεσιν</span>, Diog. L. <a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm" title="For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;">Hebrews 3:14</a>. So <span class="greekheb">συμπόσιον κατασ</span>. Plato, <span class="ital">Rep.</span>, 363 C. <span class="greekheb">σκεύεσιν ἰδίοις τὴν ναῦν κατεσκεύασα</span>, Demosth., <span class="ital">Polyc.</span>, 1208. Thence, like our word “furnish” or “prepare,” it took the wider meaning of “making” or “building” or “providing”. Thus the shipbuilder <span class="greekheb">κατασκ</span>. the ship; the mason <span class="greekheb">κατασ</span>. the tower. So in <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a> <span class="greekheb">κατεσκεύασε κιβωτόν</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm" title="Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.">1 Peter 3:20</a>. (Further, see Stephanus and Bleek). In the present verse it has its most comprehensive meaning, and includes the planning, building, and filling of the house with furniture and with a household. The household is more directly in view than the house. The argument involves that Jesus is identified with the builder of the house, while Moses is considered a part of the house. It is the Son (who in those last Days has spoken God’s word to men through the lips of Jesus), who in former times also fulfilled God’s purpose by building His house and creating for Him a people. And lest the readers of the epistle should object that Moses was as much the builder of the old as Jesus of the new, the writer lifts their mind from the management of the system or Church to the creation of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">who was faithful</span>] Lit., “Being faithful,” i.e. as Cranmer excellently rendered it, “how that he is faithful.” The word is suggested by the following contrast between Christ and Moses, of whom it had been said “My servant Moses is not so, who was <span class="ital">faithful</span> in all mine house,” <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to him that appointed him</span>] Lit., “to Him that <span class="ital">made</span> Him.” There can be little doubt that the expression means, as in the A.V. “to Him that made Him <span class="ital">such</span>,” i.e. made Him an Apostle and High Priest. For the phrase is doubtless suggested by <a href="/1_samuel/12-6.htm" title="And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.">1 Samuel 12:6</a>, where the LXX. has “He that <span class="ital">made</span> Moses and Aaron” (A.V. “advanced”); comp. <a href="/mark/3-14.htm" title="And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,">Mark 3:14</a>, “And He <span class="ital">made</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐποίησε</span>) Twelve, that they should be with Him.” <a href="/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a>, “God made Him Lord and Christ.” The rendering “appointed” is therefore a perfectly faithful one. Still the peculiarity of the phrase was eagerly seized upon by Arians to prove that Christ was <span class="ital">a created Being</span>, and this was one of the causes which retarded the general acceptance of the Epistle. Yet even if “made” was not here used in the sense of “appointed” the Arians would have had no vantage ground; for the word might have been applied to the Incarnation (so Athanasius, and Primasius), though not (as Bleek and Lünemann take it) to the Eternal Generation of the Son.

In respect of faithfulness to him who constituted him in his office, Christ resembles Moses; in respect to his office itself, it is to be shown that he is far above him. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "his house" means <span class="accented">God's</span> house, as' is plain from the text cited, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the house of him who appointed him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that "in all his house" has reference to Moses only, not to Christ; for the main point of what follows is that Christ is <span class="accented">over</span> God's house, not in it, as Moses was.

"appointed "), it may have been suggested by <a href="/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>, where the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, the Hebrew verb being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span>, which seems to mean in this case "constitute," not "create" (so Gesenius).

Nor need reference be supposed to his human birth or conception, the <span class="accented">temporalis generatio</span> of the man Jesus (Athanasius, Ambrose, and other Fathers). Certainly not to his eternal generation (as Bleek and Lunemann); such reference is foreign to the idea of the passage; nor could the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with any propriety be so used. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who was faithful (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>Rend.

This is reserved for chs. 5-7. Instead, the writer proceeds to show that Christ is superior to Moses, as he has already shown his superiority to angels. He will thus have shown Christ's superiority to both the agencies by which the old covenant was mediated. The subject is a delicate one to treat for Jewish readers to whom Moses was the object of the deepest veneration; but the treatment displays tact by placing Moses in the foreground beside Christ as an example of fidelity to his commission. Justice is thus done to the familiar historical record, and to God's own testimony, <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>. The general sense of the comparison is that Moses was as faithful as any servant in a house can be, while Christ was not a servant in the house, but a son, and displayed his fidelity in that capacity. </body></html>
