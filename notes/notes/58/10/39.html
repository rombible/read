The Christian spirit is not a selfish spirit; it puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them, and pleading for them. All things here are but shadows. The happiness of the saints in heaven will last for ever; enemies can never take it away as earthly goods. This will make rich amends for all we may lose and suffer here. The greatest part of the saints' happiness, as yet, is in promise. It is a trial of the patience of Christians, to be content to live after their work is done, and to stay for their reward till God's time to give it is come. He will soon come to them at death, to end all their sufferings, and to give them a crown of life. The Christian's present conflict may be sharp, but will be soon over. God never is pleased with the formal profession and outward duties and services of such as do not persevere; but he beholds them with great displeasure. And those who have been kept faithful in great trails for the time past, have reason to hope for the same grace to help them still to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith and patience, even the salvation of their souls. Living by faith, and dying in faith, our souls are safe for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But we are not of them ... - We who are true Christians do not belong to such a class. In this the apostle expresses the fullest conviction that none of those to whom he wrote would apostatize. The case which he had been describing was only a supposable case, not one which he believed would occur. He had only been stating what "must" happen if a sincere Christian should apostatize. But he did not mean to say that this "would" occur in regard to them. or in any case. He made a statement of a general principle under the divine administration, and he designed that this should be a means of keeping them in the path to life. What could be a more effectual means than the assurance that if a Christian should apostatize "he must inevitably perish forever?" See the sentiment in this verse illustrated at length in the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-10</a>.<p>Remarks<p>(1) It is a subject of rejoicing that we are brought under a more perfect system than the ancient people of God were. We have not merely a rude outline - a dim and shadowy sketch of religion, as they had. We are not now required to go before a bloody altar every day, and lead up a victim to be slain. We may come to the altar of God feeling that the great sacrifice has been made, and that the last drop of blood to make atonement has been shed. A pure, glorious, holy body was prepared for the Great Victim, and in that body he did the will of God and died for our sins; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>.<p>(2) like that Great Redeemer, let us do the will of God. It may lead us through sufferings, and we may he called to meet trials strongly resembling his. But the will of God is to be done alike in bearing trials, and in prayer and praise. "Obedience" is the great thing which he demands; which he has always sought. When his ancient people led up in faith, a lamb to the altar, still he preferred obedience to sacrifice; and when his Son came into the world to teach us how to live, and how to die, still the great thing was obedience. He came to illustrate the nature of perfect conformity to the will of God, and he did that by a most holy life, and by the most patient submission to all the trials appointed him in his purpose to make atonement for the sins of the world. Our model, alike in holy living and holy dying, is to be the Saviour; and like him we are required to exercise simple submission to the will of God; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>.<p>(3) the Redeemer looks calmly forward to the time when all his foes will be brought in submission to his feet; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a>. He is at the right hand of God. His great work on earth is done. He is to suffer no more. He is exalted beyond the possibility of pain and sorrow, and he is seated now on high looking to the period when all his foes shall be subdued and he will be acknowledged as universal Lord.<p>(4) the Christian has exalted advantages. He has access to the mercy-seat of God. He may enter by faith into the "Holiest" - the very heavens where God dwells. Christ, his great High Priest, has entered there; has sprinkled over the mercy-seat with his blood, and ever lives there to plead his cause. There is no privilege granted to people like that of a near and constant access to the mercy-seat. This is the privilege not of a few; and not to be enjoyed but once in a year, or at distant intervals, but which the most humble Christian possesses, and which may be enjoyed at all times, and in all places. There is not a Christian so obscure, so poor, so ignorant that he may not come and speak to God; and there is not a situation of poverty, want, or wo, where he may not make his wants known with the assurance that his prayers will be heard through faith in the great Redeemer; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>.<p>(5) when we come before God, let our hearts be pure; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>. The body has been washed with pure water in baptism, emblematic of the purifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Let the conscience be also pure. Let us lay aside every unholy thought. Our worship will not be acceptable; our prayers will not be heard, if it is not so. "If we regard iniquity in our hearts the Lord will not hear us." No matter though there be a great High Priest; no matter though he have offered a perfect sacrifice for sin, and no matter though the throne of God be accessible to people, yet if there is in the heart the love of sin; if the conscience is not pure, our prayers will not be heard. Is this not one great reason why our worship is so barren and unprofitable?<p>(6) it is the duty of Christians to exhort one another to mutual fidelity; <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>. We should so far regard the interests of each other, as to strive to promote our mutual advance in piety. The church is one. All true Christians are brethren. Each one has an interest in the spiritual welfare of every one who loves the Lord Jesus, and should strive to increase his spiritual joy and usefulness. A Christian brother often goes astray and needs kind admonition to reclaim him; or he becomes disheartened and needs encouragement to cheer him or his Christian way.<p>(7) Christians should not neglect to assemble together for the worship of God; <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>. It is a duty which they owe to God to acknowledge him publicly, and their own growth in piety is essentially connected with public worship. It is impossible for a man to secure the advancement of religion in his soul who habitually neglects public worship, and religion will not flourish in any community where this duty is not performed. There are great benefits growing out of the worship of God, which can be secured in no other way. God has made us social beings, and he intends that the social principle shall be called into exercise in religion, as well as in other things. We have common wants, and it is proper to present them together before the mercy-seat. We have received common blessings in our creation, in the providence of God, and in redemption, and it is proper that we should assemble together and render united praise to our Maker for his goodness.<p>Besides, in any community, the public worship of God does more to promote intelligence, order, peace, harmony, friendship, neatness of apparel, and purity and propriety of contact between neighbors, than anything else can, and for which nothing else can be a compensation. Every Christian, and every other man, therefore, is bound to lend his influence in thus keeping up the worship of God, and should always be in his place in the sanctuary. The particular thing in the exhortation of the apostle is, that this should be done "even in the face of persecution." The early Christians felt so much the importance of this, that we are told they were accustomed to assemble at night. Forbidden to meet in public houses of worship, they met in caves, and even when threatened with death they continued to maintain the worship of God. It may be added, that so important is this, that it should be preserved even when the preaching of the gospel is not enjoyed. Let Christians assemble together. Let them pray and offer praise. Let them read the Word of God, and an appropriate sermon. Even this will exert an influence on them and on the community of incalculable importance, and will serve to keep the flame of piety burning on the altar of their own hearts, and in the community around them.<p>(8) we may see the danger of indulging in any sin; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>. None can tell to what it may lead. No matter how small and unimportant it may appear at the time, yet if indulged in it will prove that there is no true religion, and will lead on to those greater offences which make shipwreck of the Christian name, and ruin the soul. He that "wilfully" and deliberately sins "after he professes to have received the knowledge of the truth," shows that his religion is but a name, and that he has never known any thing of its power.<p>(9) we should guard with sacred vigilance against everything which might lead to apostasy; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-29</a>. If a sincere Christian "should" apostatize from God, he could never be renewed and saved. There would remain no more sacrifice for sins; there is no other Saviour to be provided; there is no other Holy Spirit to be sent down to recover the apostate. Since, therefore; so fearful a punishment would follow apostasy from the true religion, we may see the guilt of everything which has a "tendency" to it. That guilt is to be measured by the fearful consequences which would ensue if it were followed out; and the Christian should, therefore, tremble when he is on the verge of committing any sin whose legitimate tendency would be such a result.<p>(10) we may learn from the views presented in this chapter <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a>, the error of those who suppose that a true Christian may fall away and be renewed again and saved. If there is any principle clearly settled in the New Testament, it is, that if a sincere Christian should apostatize, "he must perish." There would be no possibility of renewing him. He would have tried the only religion which saves people, and it would in his case have failed; he would have applied to the only blood which purifies the soul, and it would have been found inefficacious; he would have been brought under the only influence which renews the soul, and that would not have been sufficient to save him. What hope could there be? What would then save him if these would not? To what would he apply to what Saviour, to what blood of atonement, to what renewing and sanctifying agent, if the gospel, and the Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit had all been tried in vain? There are few errors in the community more directly at variance with the express teachings of the Bible than the belief that a Christian may fall away and he again renewed.<p>(11) Christians, in their conflicts, their trials, and their temptations, should be strengthened by what is past; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32-35</a>. They should remember the days when they were afflicted and God sustained them, when they were persecuted and he brought them relief. It is proper also to remember for their own encouragement; now, the spirit of patience and submission which they were enabled to manifest in those times of trial, and the sacrifices which they were enabled to make. They may find in such things evidence that they are the children of God; and they should find in their past experience proof that he who has borne them through past trials, is able to keep them unto his everlasting kingdom.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. A Pauline elegant turning-off from denunciatory warnings to charitable hopes of his readers (Ro 8:12).<p>saving of the soul&#8212;literally, "acquisition (or obtaining) of the soul." The kindred Greek verb is applied to Christ's acquiring the Church as the purchase of His blood (Ac 20:28).

There is a drawing back which is not unto perdition; persons may be attended with much unbelief, may be very cold and indifferent to Gospel ordinances, may fall into great sins, and may greatly backslide, and yet be recovered, as David, Peter, and others: and there is a drawing back to perdition; when Christ is rejected as the alone Saviour; when he is not held to as the head; when false doctrines and damnable heresies are given into; and when men draw back, and never return, nor are they, nor can they be returned, and their apostasy is total, and final: but true believers do not, and cannot draw back in this sense; because they are held fast in the arms, and with the cords of everlasting love, are chosen of God unto salvation, are given unto Christ, and secured in him; they are redeemed and purchased by him; they are united to him, and built upon him; they are interested in his prayers and preparations, and are his jewels, and his portion; they are regenerated, sanctified, inhabited, and sealed by the Spirit of God, and have the promises and power of God, on their side. <p>But of them that believe to the saving of the soul; or "of faith, to the salvation of the soul"; not of faith of miracles, nor of an historical faith; but of that faith, which is the faith of God's elect, is the gift of God, and the operation of his Spirit; by which a soul sees Christ, goes to him, lays holds on him, commits all to him, and expects all from him: this stands opposed to drawing back; for by faith a man lives, walks, and stands; and with this is connected the salvation of the soul, as opposed to perdition; not as though it is a cause of salvation, but as a means of God's appointing to receive the blessings of salvation, and which is entirely consistent with the grace of God; and since salvation and faith are inseparably connected together, so that he that has the one shall have the other, it follows, that true believers can never perish. The nature and excellency of this grace is largely treated of in the following chapter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a>.

In these words the writer shews that in his awful warnings against apostasy he is only putting a <span class="ital">hypothetical</span> case. “His readers,” he says, “though some of them may have gone towards the verge, have not yet passed over the fatal line.” The word Faith is here introduced with the writer’s usual skill to prepare for the next great section of the Epistle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm" title="But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.">Hebrews 10:39</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ ἐσμὲν</span>, <span class="ital">we are not</span>) A polite expression, according to the style of Paul, <a href="/romans/8-12.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.">Romans 8:12</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">ὑποστολῆς</span>) corresponds to <span class="greekheb">ὑποστείληται</span>, <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀπώλειαν</span>, <span class="ital">unto destruction</span>) They perish, who do not approve their souls unto GOD.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς περιποίησιν ψυχῆς</span>, <span class="ital">unto the saving of the soul</span>) It corresponds to, <span class="ital">shall live</span>, <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>—————<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe unto the saving of the soul</span>; literally, <span class="accented">not of the drawing back unto</span>...  <span class="accented">but of faith unto</span>, etc. Thus, once more before proceeding to the subject now before him, the writer is careful to disclaim any real expectation of defection in his readers, and with delicacy he includes himself with them by his use of the nominative plural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But we are not of them who draw back (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit. we are not of shrinking back. &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768; N.T.o, olxx, oClass. &#x395;&#787;&#768;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; with genitive marks the quality or peculiarity of a person or thing.
