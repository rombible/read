From warning he now turns to encouragement, as in Hebrews 6; and here, as there, he thankfully recalls the earlier proofs which his readers had given of their Christian constancy and love.

The Christian spirit is not a selfish spirit; it puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them, and pleading for them. All things here are but shadows. The happiness of the saints in heaven will last for ever; enemies can never take it away as earthly goods. This will make rich amends for all we may lose and suffer here. The greatest part of the saints' happiness, as yet, is in promise. It is a trial of the patience of Christians, to be content to live after their work is done, and to stay for their reward till God's time to give it is come. He will soon come to them at death, to end all their sufferings, and to give them a crown of life. The Christian's present conflict may be sharp, but will be soon over. God never is pleased with the formal profession and outward duties and services of such as do not persevere; but he beholds them with great displeasure. And those who have been kept faithful in great trails for the time past, have reason to hope for the same grace to help them still to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith and patience, even the salvation of their souls. Living by faith, and dying in faith, our souls are safe for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But call to remembrance the former days - It would seem from this, that at the time when the apostle wrote this Epistle they were suffering some severe trials, in which they were in great danger of apostatizing from their religion. It is also manifest that they had on some former occasion endured a similar trial, and had been enabled to bear it with a Christian spirit, and with resignation. The object of the apostle now is to remind them that they were sustained under those trials, and he would encourage them now to similar patience by the recollection of the grace then conferred on them. What was the nature of their former trials, or of what they were then experiencing, is not certainly known. It would seem probable, however, that the reference in both instances is to some form of persecution by their own countrymen. The meaning is, "that when we have been enabled to pass through trials once, we are to make the remembrance of the grace then bestowed on us a means of supporting and encouraging us in future trials."<p>After ye were illuminated - After you became Christians, or were enlightened to see the truth. This phrase, referring here undoubtedly to the fact that they were Christians, may serve to explain the disputed phrase in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>; see notes on that passage.<p>A great fight of afflictions - The language here seems to be taken from the Grecian games. The word "fight" means properly contention, combat, such as occurred in the public games. Here the idea is, that in the trials referred to, they had a great struggle; that is, a struggle to maintain their faith without wavering, or against those who would have led them to apostatize from their religion. Some of the circumstances attending this conflict are alluded to in the following verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

The words may be considered either as a declaration of what they had done, and be read, "but ye do call to remembrance", &amp;c. or as an exhortation to remember the days of their espousals, the times of their first conversion: and the apostle's design in this is, to mitigate the terror the preceding words might strike them with; and to aggravate the disgrace of turning back, when they had behaved so bravely in former times; and to encourage their faith and trust in God: <p>in which after ye were illuminated, by the Spirit of God, to see their impurity, impotence, and unrighteousness, and their lost and miserable state by nature; and to behold Christ and salvation by him; and to have some light into the doctrines of the Gospel; and some glimmering of the glories of another world. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it "baptized"; now such as are converted, and are brought to make a public profession of their faith, and submit to the ordinances of Christ, are, in common, immediately called to suffer reproach and persecution of one kind or another; so Christ, after his baptism, was led into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil: Satan is spiteful and malicious, and God suffers afflictions to befall his people to try their graces, and to inure them to troubles early, as follows; <p>ye endured a great fight of afflictions; meaning some violent persecution from their own countrymen, either at the death of Stephen, in which the apostle, being then unconverted; was concerned himself; or rather some other time of trouble, after the apostle was converted, to which he seems to have respect in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>, these Hebrews, being enlisted as soldiers under Christ, the Captain of their salvation, were quickly engaged in a warfare, and were called forth to fight a fight of afflictions, and a very great one; and which they endured with patience, courage, and intrepidity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</span><p>(11) As he terrified the fallers away from God, so does he now comfort them that are constant and stand firm, setting before them the success of their former fights, so stirring them up to a sure hope of a full and ready victory.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">Φωτισθέντες</span>] <span class="ital">after ye were illumined, i.e.</span> after ye had recognised Christ as the Saviour of men, and ranked yourselves among His confessors.

There follows after the warning an arousing. Mindful of the Christian manliness which the readers had displayed in former days, they are not to lose Christian joyfulness, but rather with patience to persevere in the Christian life; for only quite a short time will now elapse before the return of Christ and the coming in of the promised fulness of blessing.

That the author, as Bleek, II. 2, p. 707, thinks possible, had before his mind “the whole first period of the Christian church at Jerusalem, in which the church still held firmly together, and particularly the persecutions which preceded and followed the martyrdom of Stephen,” is hardly to be supposed. For only in a very indirect way could praise be bestowed upon the recipients of the Epistle to the Hebrews for their behaviour under <span class="ital">these</span> afflictions, seeing they formed a second generation of the Palestinian Christians, who, according to <a href="/hebrews/12-4.htm" title="You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.">Hebrews 12:4</a>, had as yet been spared persecutions having a bloody termination.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32</a>.

He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.">Hebrews 10:9</a> suddenly turns from the presentation of the terrifying aspect of apostasy to make appeal to more generous motives, so here he now encourages them to perseverance by reminding them of their praiseworthy past. As Vaughan remarks, the thought is that of <a href="/galatians/3-3.htm" title="Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?">Galatians 3:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀναμιμνήσκεσθε δὲ τὰς πρότερον ἡμέρας</span>.… “But recall the former days, in which after being enlightened ye endured much wrestling with sufferings”. <span class="greekheb">ἀναμιμ</span>, “remind yourselves,” as in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>.

[For the genitive <span class="ital">cf.</span> “certamina divitiarum,” Hor. <span class="ital">Epp.</span>, i. 5 8.] What these sufferings were is described in two clauses, they were partly in their own persons, partly in their sympathy and voluntary sharing in the suffering of others, <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο μὲν</span> … <span class="greekheb">θεατριζόμενοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο δὲ κοινωνοὶ</span> … For the distributive formula, “partly,” … “partly,” see abundant examples from the classics in Wetstein. See also Plutarch’s <span class="ital">Them.</span>, <a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm" title="For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.">Hebrews 10:4</a>. It may be rendered “as well by,” “as by”. <span class="greekheb">θεατριζόμενοι</span>, “made a spectacle,” [<span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ ἐπὶ θεάτρου παραδειγματιζόμενοι</span>, Theophyl., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>], literally true of the Christians who were expose to wild beasts in the amphitheatre. See Renan’s <span class="ital">L’Antéchrist</span>, pp. 162 ff., “A la barbarie des supplices on ajouta la dérision”. But here it was not by lions and leopards and wild bulls they were attacked, but <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδισμοῖς τε καὶ θλίψεσιν</span>, “reproaches and distresses,” “opprobriis et tribulationibus” (Vulg.). <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδισμός</span> is frequent in LXX, and several times in the phrase <span class="greekheb">λόγοι ὀνειδ</span>. In this Epistle it occurs again in <a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm" title="Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.">Hebrews 11:26</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm" title="Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.">Hebrews 13:13</a>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm" title="If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.">1 Peter 4:14</a>. Some who have not directly suffered persecution in these forms suffered by sympathy and by identifying themselves with those who were experiencing such usage, <span class="greekheb">τῶν οὕτως ἀναστρεφομένων</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Php 4:14</a>. Farrar renders well, “who lived in this condition of things”. In what sense they became <span class="greekheb">κοινωνοί</span> is immediately explained; they sympathised with those who were imprisoned and welcomed the violent seizure of their possessions. <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ</span>, as always, must here be rendered “For indeed,” “for in point of fact,” proving by more definite instances that they had become partakers with the persecuted. They had felt for the imprisoned, as was possibly alluded to in <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm" title="For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.">Hebrews 6:10</a>, and as they are in <a href="/hebrews/13-3.htm" title="Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.">Hebrews 13:3</a> exhorted still to do. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/matthew/25-36.htm" title="Naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.">Matthew 25:36</a>, which probably formed a large factor in the production of that care for the persecuted which characterised the early Church. They had also suffered the loss of their goods. <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγὴν</span>, the violent and unjust seizure, as in <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.">Matthew 23:25</a>, <a href="/luke/11-39.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.">Luke 11:39</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγὴ ὑπαρχόντων</span> occurs in Lucian and Artemidorus. See Stephanus. That which enables them to take joyfully the loss of their possessions is their consciousness that they have a possession which is better and which cannot be taken away. <span class="greekheb">γινώσκοντες ἔχειν ἑαυτοὺς</span> [for <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς</span>]. If the true reading is <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῖς</span> then the meaning is easy “knowing that you have for yourselves”. If we read <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοὺς</span>, this may mean, as Davidson, Westcott and others suppose, “knowing that you have yourselves a better possession”. But this seems not very congruous with the writer’s usual style. It is more likely that the writer uses the emphatic “you yourselves” in contrast to those who had robbed them and now possessed their goods. So von Soden. Or it may mean “ye yourselves” in contrast to the possession itself of which they have been deprived, ye yourselves however stripped of all earthly goods.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32–39</span>.

The “former days” are those in which they were in the first glow of their conversion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after ye were illuminated</span>] The word <span class="ital">photizein</span> “to enlighten” only became a synonym for ‘to baptise’ at a later period. Naturally however in the early converts baptism was synchronous with the reception of the gifts of the Holy Spirit (see <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm" title="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,">Hebrews 6:4</a>). For the metaphor—that “God hath shined in our hearts”—see <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye endured a great fight of afflictions</span>] Rather, “much wrestling of sufferings.” These were doubtless due to the uncompromising hostility of the Jewish community (see <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:...">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a>), which generally led to persecutions from the Gentiles also. To the early Christians it was given “not only to believe on Christ, but also to suffer for His sake” (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Php 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀναμιμνήσκεσθε</span>, <span class="ital">remember</span>) The Imperative.

In <span class="ital">baptism</span>, Christ is put on: Christ is the light; therefore the light is put on in baptism. <span class="ital">Enlightening</span> denotes that further accession to the force and power of the Spirit, pre-existing for us from the Old Testament, which is gained from the vigour of the New, in the case of those who were baptized. This was the first entrance into Christianity: baptism was the means of salvation in the case of those who were properly fitted for it. I am of opinion, that these divine ordinances, even in theory, are not so highly esteemed as they ought to be. In the very <span class="ital">baptism</span> of Christ, His holy human nature was magnificently <span class="ital">enlightened</span>. He was previously the Son of God; and yet the power of the Divine testimony to His Sonship, at His baptism, long affected Him in a lively manner. But, as man consists of body and soul, so divine ordinances have this double relation. We must, therefore, make no separation [between the ordinances and the grace], nor [on the other hand] is the glass to be taken for the liquor which it contains, nor should the sheath be grasped instead of the sword.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32-39.</span> - As at <a href="/hebrews/6-9.htm">Hebrews 6:9</a>, the tones of solemn warning, founded on a real sense of the possibility of apostasy in some, are now relieved by a better hope. In <a href="/hebrews/6-9.htm">Hebrews 6:9</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>, the writer expressed his own confidence in his readers on the ground of their conduct in the past; here he reminds them of their conduct by way of confirming their own steadfastness, and this with judgment as well as delicacy; for, as Theodoret remarks on this passage, "nothing so excites to zeal as the remembrance of one's own right doings." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great fight of afflictions</span>; rather, <span class="accented">conflict of sufferings.</span> On <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("enlightened"), cf. <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, and what was said there as to the meaning of the word. Here certainly the context seems naturally to suggest a definite reference to baptism, as marking the date of the commencement of exposure to persecution. But if so, not, of course, so as to exclude the idea of inward spiritual enlightenment. "Hie primus erat ingressus ad Christianismum; baptismus apud idoneos salutare medium.
