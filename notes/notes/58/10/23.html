The apostle referred to that <span class="ital">profession </span>or <span class="ital">confession </span>of their hope of eternal life, which believers made at their baptism. For being God’s children, and heirs through faith in Christ, (<a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>,) they had an undoubted right to hope for the heavenly inheritance: <span class="ital">without wavering </span>— Without giving way to any doubt or fear in a case where we have such certain and indubitable evidence; or unmoved by the threats of our persecutors. <span class="ital">For he is faithful that promised </span>— That is, all the promises of God shall be made good to us, if we continue steadfast. <span class="ital">And let us consider one another </span>— Let us reflect seriously on one another’s temptations, trials, infirmities, failings, and other circumstances attending us, that we may judge what influence we can have over one another for our mutual advantage: and especially <span class="ital">to provoke </span>and excite one another <span class="ital">unto love to </span>God, his people, and all mankind; <span class="ital">and to good works</span> — Of all kinds, the proper fruits of love. <span class="ital">Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together — </span>For public or social worship; <span class="ital">as the manner of some is </span>— Either through fear of persecution, or from a vain imagination that they are above external ordinances; <span class="ital">but exhorting one another </span>— To constancy in the faith, zeal and diligence in all works of piety and virtue; <span class="ital">and so much the more as ye see the day approaching </span>— That awful day, in which we must appear before the tribunal of God, preceded by the day of death, which is drawing continually nearer, and will fix our character and condition for ever. As also that day of vengeance coming on the Jewish nation, which Christ hath described as so terrible an emblem of the day of final judgment, and the conflagration of the world. From what Christ had said concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, and the dreadful calamities awaiting the Jews, as events that should happen during the lives of some who had been present with him about thirty years before the date of this epistle, these Hebrews might infer that these judgments were now near, and doubtless might see them approaching, by the appearing of those signs which our Lord had said should precede them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:19-25 The apostle having closed the first part of the epistle, the doctrine is applied to practical purposes. As believers had an open way to the presence of God, it became them to use this privilege. The way and means by which Christians enjoy such privileges, is by the blood of Jesus, by the merit of that blood which he offered up as an atoning sacrifice. The agreement of infinite holiness with pardoning mercy, was not clearly understood till the human nature of Christ, the Son of God, was wounded and bruised for our sins. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to us the way of life, and to those who believe this, he will be precious. They must draw near to God; it would be contempt of Christ, still to keep at a distance. Their bodies were to be washed with pure water, alluding to the cleansings directed under the law: thus the use of water in baptism, was to remind Christians that their conduct should be pure and holy. While they derived comfort and grace from their reconciled Father to their own souls, they would adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things. Believers are to consider how they can be of service to each other, especially stirring up each other to the more vigorous and abundant exercise of love, and the practice of good works. The communion of saints is a great help and privilege, and a means of stedfastness and perseverance. We should observe the coming of times of trial, and be thereby quickened to greater diligence. There is a trying day coming on all men, the day of our death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering - To secure this was one of the leading designs of this Epistle, and hence, the apostle adverts to it so frequently. It is evident that those whom he wrote were suffering persecution <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>, and that there was great danger that they would apostatize. As these persecutions came probably from the Jews, and as the aim was to induce them to return to their former opinions, the object of the apostle is to show that there was in the Christian scheme every advantage of which the Jews could boast; everything pertaining to the dignity of the great Founder of the system, the character of the High Priest, and the nature and value of the sacrifices offered, and that all this was possessed far more abundantly in the permanent Christian system than in what was typical in its character, and which were designed soon to vanish away. In view of all this, therefore, the apostle adds that they should hold fast the profession of their faith without being shaken by their trials, or by the arguments of their enemies. We have the same inducement to hold fast the profession of our faith - for it is the same religion still; we have the same Saviour, and there is held out to us still the same prospect of heaven.<p>For he is faithful that promised - To induce them to hold fast their profession, the apostle adds this additional consideration. God, who had promised eternal life to them, was faithful to all that he had said. The argument here is:<p>(1) that since God is so faithful to us, we ought to be faithful to him;<p>(2) the fact that he is faithful is an encouragement to us.<p>We are dependent on him for grace to hold fast our profession. If he were to prove unfaithful, we should have no strength to do it. But this he never does; and we may be assured, that all that he has promised he will perform. To the service of such a God, therefore, we should adhere without wavering; compare the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

They had once, at their baptism, "confessed the good confession" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>). Let not the recurrence of Jewish prejudices, or either influence or persecution from their Jewish compatriots, or any delay of the <span class="accented">Parousia</span>, induce them to waver in maintaining it. Some among them did, it could not be denied, show signs of such wavering, notably in their remiss attendance at Christian worship; let the faithful give heed to keeping faith alive in themselves and others, and especially through the means of the regular Church assemblies. That by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> is meant definitely the actual assembling together of Christians for reading, exhortation, and worship (such as is referred to in <a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>; <a href="/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>, etc.,; and described by Justin Martyr, 'Apol., c. 87), we hold confidently with the majority of commentators and with Chrysostom. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>, where it denotes the gathering together at the <span class="accented">Parousia.</span> In 2 Macc. 2:7, where alone it occurs in the LXX., it expresses the actual assembling of people together, as does the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, both in the LXX. and the New Testament (cf. <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="/mark/13-27.htm">Mark 13:27</a>; <a href="/mark/1-33.htm">Mark 1:33</a>; <a href="/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>). Hence, and in regard to the context as well as the etymology of the word, we may reject the less definite meaning, by some here assigned to it, of <span class="accented">Christian communion</span> (<span class="accented">conjugatio fidelium</span>), and the explanation of Bengel: "Sensus est, non modo debetis synagogam frequentare, ut Judaei, quod libentius facitis, sed etiam episynagogam, ut Christiani. Neque tamen innuitur praecise aggregatio ad unum locum, aut aggregatio ad unam <span class="accented">fidem</span>; sed, medio sensu, congregatio mutua <span class="accented">per amorem</span> et communicatio publica et privata officiorum Christianorum." The seen approach of the second advent (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>) is adduced as an additional argument against remissness. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> seems to imply more than the general belief in its imminence, founded on the language of Christ. It would seem as if the signs of the times were interpreted as denoting its approach (el. <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). And it may be that they were rightly so interpreted in reference to the primary fulfillment of our Savior's words, though to that only, as the event proved. The blending together in the discourses of <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, <a href="/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>, <a href="/luke/17.htm">Luke 17</a>. and 21, of the times of the fall of Jerusalem and of the final day, would naturally lead Christians to regard the signs of the first event as denoting the other also. And indeed the imminence of the first, of which the signs were really apparent, was in itself a peculiar reason why the Hebrew Christians should stick resolutely to Christianity, for its own sake and apart from Judaism. Else might their whole hold on Christ be loosened in the temple's fall Thus, though the writer might share in the mistaken view then prevalent of the imminence of the final day, his warning, founded on the supposed signs of it, hits well the peculiar needs of his readers. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Profession of our faith (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Rend.
