In the thought itself there is no real difficulty, if we are careful to take into account the principle which prevailed throughout, that pre-eminence depended upon descent alone. Had Judah possessed an inherent superiority over his brother Levi, the descendants of Judah (in such a system as is here before us) might have claimed the like pre-eminence over the descendants of Levi. “Through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath payed tithes.” The descendants of Abraham cannot but occupy a lower position in presence of one who appears as Abraham’s superior.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:4-10 That High Priest who should afterward appear, of whom Melchizedec was a type, must be much superior to the Levitical priests.

For numerous examples in the classic writers of this expression, see Wetstein in loc. It is used precisely as it is with us when we say "so to speak," or "if I may be allowed the expression." It is employed when what is said is not strictly and literally true, but when it amounts to the same thing, or when about the same idea is conveyed. "It is a "softening down" of an expression which a writer supposes his readers may deem too strong, or which may have the appearance of excess or severity. It amounts to an indirect apology for employing an unusual or unexpected assertion or phrase." "Prof. Stuart." Here Paul could not mean that Levi had actually paid tithes in Abraham - for he had not then an existence; or that Abraham was his representative - for there had been no appointment of Abraham to act in that capacity by Levi; or that the act of Abraham was imputed or reckoned to Levi, for that was not true, and would not have been pertinent to the case if it were so. But it means, that in the circumstances of the case, the same thing occurred in regard to the superiority of Melchizedek, and the inferiority of the Levitical priesthood, as if Levi had been present with Abraham, and had himself actually paid tithes on that occasion. This was so because Abraham was the distinguished ancestor of Levi, and when an ancestor has done an act implying inferiority of rank to another, we feel as if the whole family or all the descendants, by that act recognized the inferiority, unless something occurs to change the relative rank of the persons. Here nothing indicating any such change had occurred. Melchizedek had no descendants of which mention is made, and the act of Abraham, as the head of the Hebrew race, stood therefore as if it were the act of all who descended from him.<p>Levi - The ancestor of the whole Levitical priesthood, and from whom they received their name. He was the third son of Jacob and Leah, and was born in Mesopotamia. On account of the conduct of Simeon and Levi toward Shechem, for the manner in which he had treated their sister Dinah <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>, and which Jacob characterized as "cruelty" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-6</a>, Jacob said that they should be "scattered in Israel." <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>. Afterward the whole tribe of Levi was chosen by God to execute the various functions of the priesthood, and were "scattered" over the land, having no inheritance of their own, but deriving their subsistence from the offerings of the people; <a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a> ff. Levi is here spoken of as the ancestor of the tribe, or collectively to denote the entire Jewish priesthood.<p>Who receiveth tithes - That is, his descendants, the priests and Levites, receive tithes.<p>Payed tithes in Abraham - It is the same as if he had payed tithes in or by Abraham. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. as I may so say&#8212;to preclude what he is about to say being taken in the mere literal sense; I may say that, virtually, Levi, in the person of his father Abraham, acknowledged Melchisedec's superiority, and paid tithes to him.<p>who receiveth tithes&#8212;(Compare Heb 7:5).<p>in Abraham&#8212;Greek, "by means of (by the hand of) Abraham"; through Abraham.

This was not properly, but figuratively; true parents and children being accounted here as one person before they exist, as well as after; Levi, not actually existing then, but virtually in his parent. Christ was in his loins virtually too, as to his humanity, but not to descend of him by natural propagation, but by miracle; and in him as an antitype to this Melchisedec, and one to be set above him, in whom Melchisedec himself was to be blessed, and therefore could not pay tenths to him in Abraham. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hebrews/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as l may so say,....

Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">Τὸ δὲ ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ἢ τοῦτο σημαίνει ὅτι καὶ ἐν συντόμῳ εἰπεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἵνʼ οὕτως εἴπω</span>. In the former sense our passage is apprehended by Camerarius, Jac. Cappellus, Er. Schmid, Owen (preferably), Elsner, Wolf, Bengel, Heumann; in the latter,—and this is here the more correct one,—the Vulgate, Faber Stapulensis, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Schlichting, Grotius, Carpzov, Kypke, Heinsius, Böhme, Kuinoel, Stuart, Bleek, de Wette, Stengel, Tholuck, Bloomfield, Bisping, Delitzsch, Alford, Maier, Moll, Kurtz, Ewald, Hofmann, Woerner, and the majority. The author himself feels that the thought he is on the point of expressing has something singular and unusual about it. Thus he mitigates and limits the harshness thereof by <span class="greekheb">ὠς ἔπος εἰπεῖν</span>, whereby he indicates that the ensuing statement is, notwithstanding its inner truth, not to be understood literally.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διʼ Ἀβραάμ</span>] <span class="ital">by Abraham, i.e.</span> by the fact that Abraham gave the tenth. <span class="greekheb">Ἀβραάμ</span> is a genitive.

It is frequent in Philo, see examples in Carpzov and add <span class="ital">Quis rer. div. her.</span>, 3. Adam’s note on Plato, <span class="ital">Apol.

The phrase is regularly used to limit the extent or comprehension of a phrase or word. It is generally, but by no means exclusively, found with <span class="greekheb">f1οὐδείς</span> and <span class="greekheb">πάντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν</span> ‘hardly anyone’; <span class="greekheb">πάντες ὡς ἔ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰπ</span>. = nearly everyone.” A significant use occurs in the <span class="ital">Republic</span>, p. 34IB, where Socrates asks Thrasymachus whether in speaking of a “Ruler” he means <span class="greekheb">τὸν ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν ἢ τὸν ἀκριβεῖ λόγῳ</span>. The phrase is discussed at great length by Raphel. The further idea is, that “through Abraham even Levi, he who receives tithes, has paid tithes,” the explanation being <span class="greekheb">ἔτι γὰρ ἐν τῇ ὀσφύϊ</span> … “for he [Levi] was yet in the loins of his father [Abraham] when Melchizedek met him,” Isaac not yet having been begotten. There was a tendency in Jewish theology to view heredity in this realistic manner. Thus Schoettgen quotes Ramban on <a href="/genesis/5-2.htm" title="Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.">Genesis 5:2</a> “God calls the first human pair Adam [man] because all men were in them potentially or virtually [virtualiter]”. And so some of the Rabbis argued “Eodem peccato, quo peccavit primus homo, peccavit totus mundus, quoniam hic erat totus mundus.” Hence Augustine’s formula “peccare in lumbis Adam,” and his explanation “omnes fuimus in illo uno quando omnes fuimus ille unus” (<span class="ital">De Civ. Dei</span>, xiii. 14).

For, inasmuch as the whole position of Levi and his tribe, in the old dispensation, came by inheritance from the great patriarch who received the promises, the subordination of the patriarch to one above himself involved that of all who so inherited, it is not simply the physical descent of Levi from Abraham, but the peculiar position of the latter as "the patriarch," that justifies the assertion that Levi paid tithes through him. And thus, while we remember how Abraham is elsewhere viewed in Scripture as the representative of the chosen people, and also how the lives of individual patriarchs (notably so in the case of Jacob and Esau) are so told and referred to as to prefigure the positions and fortunes of the races they represent, we may recognize in this assertion no mere rabbinical fancy, but an interpretation true to the spirit of the Old Testament. Be it further observed that the original significance of Abraham's action as bearing upon his descendants is enhanced by the fact that, while it was <span class="accented">after</span> the receiving of the promise, it was <span class="accented">before</span> the birth of Isaac.
