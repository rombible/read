This verse explains "without descent" (Greek, "genealogy" in both verses, Heb 7:3).

Paul exalts Abraham in order still more to exalt Melchisedec. When Christ is the subject, the singular "promise" is used. "The promises" in the plural, refer to God's promise of greatness to himself and his seed, and of the possession of Canaan, twice repeated before the blessing of Melchisedec. As the priests, though above the people (Heb 7:7) whom it was their duty to "bless," were yet subordinate to Abraham; and as Abraham was subordinate to Melchisedec, who blessed him, Melchisedec must be much above the Levitical priests.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The proof is here applied, showing Melchisedec to be greater, not than the Levitical priest only, but than Abraham himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But he whose descent is not counted from them; </span> he drew not his genealogy from any priests before him, but is greater than those priests, who by genealogy and succession were made such, and set above their brethern by God himself: he being independent, having no progenitor, priest, or successor, is greater than whom he decimateth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises; </span> he decimated Abraham, the father of the Levitical priests, and by the Most High’s order blessed him, by assuring him of his peace with God, grace continually from him, and multiplying temporal and spiritual blessings to him, according as God promised, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1</a></span>, &c. And this he did to him, though Abraham was a patriarch, and privileged with promises above any other; yet though God were made over to him in all his fulness, the blessing given him of fatherhood to a numerous nation, even the visible church of God among Israel, as to all believing Gentiles, who had Canaan literally promised to his posterity, and even this Salem, among the rest, of which Melchisedec was king, and the heavenly Canaan to himself; and above all, the promised Messiah to descend from him, in whom himself and all nations were to be blessed; he, so great in promises, is tithed and blessed by a greater Melchisedec. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hebrews/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But he whose descent is not counted from them, &amp;c. That is, Melchizedek, whose genealogy or pedigree is not reckoned from the Levites, nor from any from whom they descend; his lineal descent is not the same with theirs; and so did not receive tithes by any law, as they did, but by virtue of his superiority: received tithes of Abraham; not from the people, or his brethren, but from Abraham, the father of the people of Israel, and of Levi himself: <p>and blessed him that had the promises; of a Son, and of the Messiah, that should spring from him, in whom all nations should be blessed, and of the land of Canaan, and of the blessings of grace and glory. This shows that Melchizedek had a descent, though it was not known; and that, since his descent was not the same with the Levites, he was a more proper type of Christ, who belonged not to that, but another tribe. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/7-6.htm" title="But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.">Hebrews 7:6</a>.

See Burton, 82, “When the Perfect Indicative is used of a past event which is by reason of the context necessarily thought of as separated from the moment of speaking by an interval, it is impossible to render it into English adequately”. The point which the writer here brings out is that, although Abraham had the promises, and was therefore himself a fountain of blessing to mankind and the person on whom all succeeding generations depended for blessing, yet Melchizedek blessed him; and as the writer adds:—<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">and blessed</span>] Lit., <span class="ital">and hath blessed</span>.

And at the same time this second point—the superiority of Melchisedec to Abraham—namely, <span class="ital">the blessing</span>, is conveniently connected with the former point concerning <span class="ital">tithes</span>, because its description is afterwards completed.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν ἔχοντα</span>, <span class="ital">who had</span>) This both increases Abraham’s dignity, and intimates that even the posterity, who had been then already promised to Abraham, would yield the superiority to Melchisedec.—<span class="greekheb">τὰς ἐπαγγελίας</span>, <span class="ital">the promises</span>) plural.

Hence he was greater than Abraham. The right of the Levitical priest to receive tithes was only a legal right, conferred by special statute, and therefore implied no intrinsic superiority to his brethren; but Melchisedec, though having no legal right, received tithes from Abraham as a voluntary gift, which implied Abraham's recognition of his personal greatness.<p>And hath blessed him that had the promises<p>Melchisedec accepted the position accorded to him by Abraham's gift of tithes by bestowing on Abraham his blessing, and Abraham recognized his superiority by accepting his blessing.
