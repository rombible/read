In other words, the prediction of the rising up of a priest of a different order from that of Aaron, is a declaration of the inefficacy of the Levitical priesthood, and of God’s intention to change it. Instead of the clause, <span class="ital">for under it, </span>(namely, the Levitical priesthood,) Macknight reads, <span class="ital">on account of it, the people received the law </span>— Observing that the law “was prior to the priesthood, being given for the purpose of forming and establishing the priesthood; and that the Jewish people themselves were separated from the rest of mankind, and made a people by the law, merely that they might, as a nation, worship the only true God according to the Levitical ritual, in settling which most of the precepts of the law were employed. This being the case, is it any wonder that such of the Jews as looked no farther than the outside of the priesthood and law, imagined that perfection, in respect of pardon and acceptance with God, was to be obtained by the Levitical priesthood and sacrifices, and in that persuasion believed they never would be abolished? Nevertheless, if they had understood the true meaning of the law, they would have known that it was a typical oracle, in which, by its services, the priesthood and sacrifice of the Son of God were prefigured, and that by calling his Son a priest, not after the order of Aaron, but after that of Melchisedec, God declared that his services as a High-Priest, and the sacrifice of himself which he was to offer, were entirely different, both in their nature and effects, from the Levitical services and sacrifices, and that they were to be substituted in the room of these services, for which there was no occasion after the priest and sacrifices which they prefigured, were come.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood - As the Jews supposed. They were accustomed to regard the system as perfect. It was an appointment of God, and they were tenacious of the opinion that it was to be permanent, and that it needed no change. But Paul says that this could not be. Even from their own Scriptures it was apparent that a priest was to arise of another order, and of a more permanent character, and this he says was full proof: that there was defect of some kind in the previous order. What this defect was, he does not here specify, but the subsequent reasoning shows that it was in such points as these - that it was not permanent; that it could not make the worshippers perfect; that the blood which they offered in sacrifice could not take away sin, and could not render those who offered it holy; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>.<p>For under it the people received the law - This assertion seems necessary in order to establish the point maintained in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-12.htm">Hebrews 7:12</a>, that if the priesthood is changed there must be also a change of the Law. In order to this, it was necessary to admit that the Law was received under that economy, and that "it was a part of it," so that the change of one involved also the change of the other. It was not strictly true that the whole Law was given after the various orders of Levitical priest were established - for the Law on Sinai, and several other laws, were given before that distinct arrangement was made; but it was true:<p>(1) that a considerable part of the laws of Moses were given under that arrangement; and,<p>(2) that the whole of the ceremonial observances was connected with that. They were parts of one system, and mutually dependent on each other. This is all that the argument demands.<p>What further need was there ... - "If that system would lead to perfection; if it was sufficient to make the conscience pure, and to remove sin, then there was no necessity of any other. Yet the Scriptures have declared that there "would be" another of a different order, implying that there was some defect in the former." This reasoning is founded on the fact that there was an express prediction of the coming of a priest of a different "order" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, and that this fact implied that there was some deficiency in the former arrangement. To this reasoning it is impossible to conceive that there can be any objection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. perfection&#8212;absolute: "the bringing of man to his highest state, namely, that of salvation and sanctification."<p>under it&#8212;The reading in the oldest manuscripts is, "Upon it (that is, on the ground of it as the basis, the priest having to administer the law, Mal 2:7: it being presupposed) the people (Heb 9:19, 'all the people') have received the law (the Greek is perfect, not aorist tense; implying the people were still observing the law)."<p>what further need&#8212;(Heb 8:7).

On the contrary, the infinitive clause <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδὲκ ἕτερον ἀνίστασθαι ἱερέα</span> depends at once upon the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb">τίς ἔτι χρεία</span>; and to this first infinitive clause the second <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρὼν λέγεσθαι</span> forms an epexegetic parallel clause: <span class="ital">What need was there still then</span> (or: <span class="ital">would there then still have been</span>) <span class="ital">that another priest should arise</span> “after the order of Melchisedec,” <span class="ital">and not be called</span> (priest) <span class="ital">after the order of Aaron</span>?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔτι</span>] <span class="ital">sc</span>. after the Levitical priesthood had long been instituted, and in general the Mosaic law promulgated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἕτερον</span>] in distinction from <span class="greekheb">ἄλλον</span>, brings prominently forward the <span class="ital">dissimilarity</span> of his nature and constitution as compared with that of the Levitical priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To <span class="greekheb">καί</span> we have not to supplement the whole idea <span class="greekheb">ἔτερον ἱερέα</span>, but only <span class="greekheb">ἱερέα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>, however, is placed, not <span class="greekheb">μή</span> as the infinitive <span class="greekheb">λέγεσθαι</span> might seem to require, because the negation extends to only a part of the clause. <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>, namely, is closely associated with <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρών</span>, and forms with the same merely a more precise definition to the <span class="greekheb">ἱερέα</span> which is to be supplied, so that the total expression <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἱερέα</span>) <span class="greekheb">οὐ κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρών</span> presents an opposition to the foregoing total expression <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδὲκ ἕτερον ἱερέα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λέγεσθαι</span>] namely, <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>.

The fifth point of superiority is that the Melchisedek Priesthood implies the abrogation of the Levitic, and of the whole law which was based upon it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for under it</span>] Rather, “for on the basis of it.” The writer regards the Priesthood rather than the Law as constituting the basis of the whole Mosaic system; so that into this slight parenthesis he really infuses the essence of his argument. The Priesthood is obviously changed. For otherwise the Theocratic King of Psalms 110 would not have been called “a Priest after the order <span class="ital">of Melchisedec</span>” but “after the order <span class="ital">of Aaron</span>” Clearly then “the order of Aaron” admitted of no attainment of perfection through its means. But if the Priesthood was thus condemned as imperfect and inefficient, the Law was equally disparaged as a transitory institution. Righteousness did not “come by the Law;” if it could so have come Christ would have died in vain (<a href="/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>.

So far the superiority of the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek to the Aaronic has been shown. The new thought is that the very mention in the psalm of a different order of priesthood implies that the old order, and with it the whole legal dispensation which depended on it, was imperfect and to be superseded. This is the general drift of vers. 11, 12, though the sequence of thought in their several clauses is not easy to follow. Ideas in the writer's mind, not expressed, seem necessary to be understood. In the parenthetical clause of ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are decidedly to be preferred, on the ground of authority, to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> of the Textus Receptus. 'The meaning of the clause (whatever be the precise thought connecting it with the sentence in which it stands) is that the whole Law rested on the institution of the priesthood; not the priests only, but the whole people (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), received their Law as grounded on it. On the same idea depends ver. 12, where it is said that a change of the priesthood involves of necessity a change of the Law. The verses next following serve to remove all doubt that there <span class="accented">is</span> a complete change of the priesthood; the proofs being, not only the patent fact that the Messiah is of the tribe, not of Levi, but of Judah (vers. 13, 14), but also, for mere abundant evidence of the Divine purpose, that significant utterance, again adduced, about his being after the order, not of Aaron, but of Melchizedek (vers. 15, 16, 17). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In Christ, as the Melchisedec-priest, the ideal of the priesthood is realized.<p>Perfection (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here and <a href="/luke/1-45.htm">Luke 1:45</a>.
