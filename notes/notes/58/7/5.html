There is an apparent difficulty here. The priests, it is urged, did not receive tithes from the people; the tithe was paid to the Levites, and but the tenth part of this tithe fell to the lot of the priests. Two considerations seem entirely to remove this difficulty. (1) The question is not one of emolument, but of position. The authority to exact tithes was in strictness vested in the priests, the supreme guardians of the laws relating to all religious duties and observances, and the Levites were but their assistants. That the priests received for their own use but a part of the tribute paid by the nation is a matter of no moment here. (2) The Levites themselves paid tithes to the priests, who therefore stood alone in receiving tithes but paying none. It is the positive ordinance of the law, and nothing but this, that raises brethren above brethren, and gives to the priest this claim upon men who would otherwise be on an equality with himself through common descent from Abraham.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:4-10 That High Priest who should afterward appear, of whom Melchizedec was a type, must be much superior to the Levitical priests.

The apostle admits that their superiority to the rest of the people was shown by the fact that they had a right to require of them the tenth part of the productions of the land for their maintenance, and for the support of religion. But still he says, that their inferiority to Melchizedek, and consequently to Christ as a priest, was shown by the fact that the illustrious ancestor of all the Jewish people, including the priests as well as others, had confessed his inferiority to Melchizedek by paying him tithes.<p>Who receive the office of the priesthood - Not all the descendants of Levi were priests. The apostle, therefore, specifies particularly those who "received this office," as being those whom he specially designed, and as those whose inferiority to Christ as a priest it was his object to show.<p>Have a commandment to take tithes - Have by the Law a commission, or a right to exact tithes of the people. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27-29</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. sons of Levi&#8212;namely, those alone who belonged to the family of Aaron, to whom the priesthood was restricted.

Now the Levites are subordinate to the priests; and these again to Abraham, their common progenitor; and Abraham to Melchisedec. "How great" (Heb 7:4) then, must this Melchisedec be in respect to his priesthood, as compared with the Levitical, though the latter received tithes! and now unspeakably great must "the Son of God" be, to whom, as the sacerdotal archetype (in God's purpose), Melchisedec was made like! Thus compare the "consider," Heb 7:4, in the case of Melchisedec, the type, with the "consider" (Greek, "contemplate attentively," see on [2556]Heb 3:1, a stronger word than here) in the case of Christ, the archetype.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is a proof by instance out of the Levitical law, that he who receiveth is greater than he who giveth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood:</span> the seed of Levi the son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/numbers/1-48.htm" title="For the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 1:48-50</a> 3:1-5</span>, and not all of them neither, but the sons of Levi descending from Aaron, were separated and consecrated in the priesthood by God’s precept, and vindicated from those who would usurp it, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/numbers/16-1.htm" title="Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:...">Numbers 16:1-17</a>:13</span>, and confirmed in it by miracle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law:</span> God himself gave them a law from heaven to tithe by, and a charge to observe this law, as to all parts of tithes, such as were due to all Levites, <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/18-24.htm" title="But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.">Numbers 18:24</a></span>, to the high priest only as God’s substitute, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/numbers/18-8.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever....">Numbers 18:8-19</a>,25-29</span>; to the Levites, widows, and poor together, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/deuteronomy/14-22.htm" title="You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year....">Deu 14:22-29</a></span>.

Those who paid tithes were Abraham’s descendants equally with the priests; it was merely the law which conveyed the right to tithe their brethren <span class="greekheb">καίπερ ἐξεληλυθότας ἐκ τῆς ὀσφύος Ἀβρααμ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">who receive the office of the priesthood</span>] The word used for “priesthood” is defined by Aristotle to mean “care concerning the gods.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to take tithes of the people according to the law</span>] Indirectly, through the agency of the Levites. Delitzsch argues that after the Exile the Priests collected the tithes themselves. It cannot however be proved that the Priests themselves tithed the people.

There is however no real difficulty about the expression, for the Priests <span class="ital">might</span> tithe the people, as Jewish tradition <span class="ital">says</span> that they did in the days of Ezra; and (2) <span class="ital">Qui facit per alium facit per se</span>. There is therefore no need to alter “the people” (<span class="ital">laon</span>) into Levi (<span class="ital">Leuin</span>).

As much as to say, "Let it not be said that the tithing of Abraham by Melchizedek implies no higher priestly prerogative than the tithing of Abraham's descendants by the sons of Aaron; for there is this difference: They, in virtue only of a special ordinance of the Law, not of original right, were allowed to tithe their brethren, though descended from the same great ancestor; he, though not of them or of the race at all, in virtue of his own inherent dignity, tithes the whole race as represented in its patriarch."
