They point out with greater fulness and clearness what is involved in the statement of <a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>. “For there is an annulling of a preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness (for the Law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, by which we draw nigh unto God.” (It must be borne in mind throughout that by the “commandment” is meant the ordinance <span class= "ital">which created the Levitical priesthood, </span>not the Law in general.) That Jesus was not made Priest according to a law of a carnal commandment (<a href="/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>) involves the annulling of that commandment; in His becoming Priest according to a power of indissoluble life is involved the introduction of a better hope. This is the general meaning, but each division of the thought is expanded. The appointment of a different priest by the very authority on which the former commandment rested, the divine decree, showed that commandment to be of force no longer: as we have already seen (<a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>), this is because the commandment is weak and unprofitable—because the priesthood it creates cannot attain the end of its institution, which is to bring men into fellowship with God. The parenthesis, “for the Law made nothing perfect,” points out that the weakness just spoken of corresponds to that imperfection which confessedly belongs to the earlier dispensation: even the Jew (who would have accounted a change of priestly line impossible) expected perfection only when Messiah should have appeared. When the earlier commandment is annulled, in its place there is brought in a better hope. The “better hope” stands connected with the “better covenant” (<a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>) and the “better promises” (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>). “And by this (better hope) we draw nigh unto God.” The end of the priesthood therefore is attained. (See <a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm" title="If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?">Hebrews 7:11</a>.) In the Law (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm" title="Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.">Leviticus 10:3</a>) the priests are “those who come nigh unto God,” that is, in the service of the sanctuary: with a nobler meaning this name shall now belong to all God’s people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof....">Hebrews 7:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">For there is verily </span>— Implied in this new and everlasting priesthood, and in the new dispensation connected therewith; <span class="ital">a disannulling of the </span>preceding <span class="ital">commandment </span>— An abrogation of the Mosaic law; <span class="ital">for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof </span>— In comparison of the new priesthood and dispensation.

The institutions of divine worship were imperfect, being mere shadowy representations of good things to come; the promises made to Abraham were but imperfectly fulfilled, and divine revelation was very incomplete, and in many respects obscure. Therefore that dispensation did not perfect the illumination of the people of God in things spiritual or divine, but they were still in comparative darkness as to divers particulars of great importance. See on <a href="/luke/1-76.htm" title="And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;">Luke 1:76</a>; <a href="/luke/1-79.htm" title="To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.">Luke 1:79</a>.

For the truths, precepts, and promises which it revealed, were chiefly of a worldly and carnal nature, and not calculated to sanctify the minds and hearts of those that received them, or to render them heavenly and holy. And the sanctifying Spirit, and the salvation consequent thereon, were not so largely given as under the gospel, <a href="/context/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink....">John 7:37-38</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:...">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>. <span class="ital">But the bringing in of a better hope </span>— The Christian dispensation, or the priesthood of Christ and the promises of the gospel, which afford more solid grounds for hope, <span class="ital">did, </span>or does; making full provision both for our justification and sanctification, and for our living in the practice of universal holiness and righteousness, and therefore furnishing us with a title to, and a meetness for, eternal life. “Promissa terrestria non operantur mortis contemptum, sed eum operantur spes melior vitæ eternæ, atque celestis. Inde tam crebra martyria.” <span class="ital">Earthly promises do not produce a</span> <span class="ital">contempt of death, but the better hope of a heavenly and eternal life produces it. Hence so many martyrdoms, </span>namely, in the first church. — Grotius. The word <span class="greekheb">επεισαγωγη</span>, rendered <span class="ital">the bringing in, </span>literally means, <span class="ital">the introduction of a thing after, </span>or <span class="ital">upon, </span>another. The priesthood and sacrifice of Christ, and the dispensation thereupon, were brought in <span class="ital">after </span>the law, <span class="ital">upon </span>it, <span class="ital">in the room of </span>it, to effect what the law could not do. This, therefore, says Dr. Owen, is the sense of the words: “The introduction of the better hope after and upon the law, when a sufficient discovery had been made of its weakness and insufficiency as to this end, made all things perfect, or hath brought the church to that state of consummation which was designed for it. It is called <span class="ital">better </span>with respect to the law, and all it contained, or could effect.” <span class="ital">By which we draw nigh unto God </span>— Have free liberty to draw nigh in faith and prayer, through the sacrifice and intercession of our ever-living and glorious High-Priest and Mediator. It is an expression, says Grotius, “properly sacerdotal, denoting the approach of the priests to God and his worship.” Under the Levitical priesthood the priests, in their sacrifices and solemn services, drew nigh to God: the same liberty is now granted to all true believers, under the sacerdotal ministration of the Lord Jesus; through him <span class="ital">they have access by one Spirit unto the Father, </span>at all times, and particularly in their prayers and praises, and all acts of worship; and may draw so nigh as to <span class="ital">become one spirit with him, </span>which is true Christian perfection.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:11-25 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come, are done away; a Priest is risen, and a dispensation now set up, by which true believers may be made perfect. That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there is verily a disannulling - A setting aside.

Elucidation of that which is signified by this proclamation in the psalm, of the arising of a new everlasting priest after the manner of Melchisedec (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm" title="For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 7:17</a>). By virtue of that proclamation of God, the Mosaic institution of the priests, and with it the Mosaic law in general, is declared—and that with good reason—to be devoid of force; and, on the other hand, a better hope is brought in. Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">Παύεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησίν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ νόμος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισάγεται δὲ ἡ τῶν κρειττόνων ἐλπίς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof....">Hebrews 7:18-19</a> contain a single proposition, dividing itself into two halves by means of <span class="greekheb">μὲν</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, for which <span class="greekheb">γίνεται</span> forms the common verb, and in which <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲν γὰρ ἐτελείωσεν ὁ νόμος</span> constitutes a parenthesis. So, rightly, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Primasius, Luther, Zeger, Camerarius, Estius, Peirce, Bengel, M‘Lean, Schulz, Böhme, Bleek, de Wette, Stengel, Tholuck, Bloomfield, Conybeare, Bisping, Delitzsch, Riehm (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 592), Alford, Maier, Moll, Kurtz, Ewald, Hofmann, Woerner, and the majority. Others construe differently, in taking each of the two verses as an independent statement in itself. They then vary as regards the interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισαγωγή</span>, <a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>, as this is looked upon either as predicate or as subject. As <span class="ital">predicate</span> it is taken by Faber Stapulensis, Erasmus (<span class="ital">Version</span>), Vatablus, Calvin, Hunnius, Jac. Cappellus, Pyle, Ebrard, and others, in supplying <span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>, and regarding as subject thereto <span class="greekheb">ὁ νόμος</span>. According to this, the sense would be: for <span class="ital">nothing</span> has the law brought to perfection; but it is (or its meaning consists in this, that it is) a bringing in of a better hope. But against this argues the fact that, if <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισαγωγὴ δέ</span> was intended to form the opposition to the first half of <a href="/hebrews/7-19.htm" title="For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.">Hebrews 7:19</a>, the author could not possibly—after having placed a verb (<span class="greekheb">ἐτελείωσεν</span>) in the first half, consisting as it does only of a few words—have continued in the second half otherwise than with a verb; he must have written <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισάγει δὲ κρείττονα ἐλπίδα</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισαγωγὴ δὲ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Moreover, <span class="greekheb">ἑπί</span> in <span class="greekheb">ἑπεισαγωγή</span> would have remained without any reference upon the supposition of this construction. As <span class="ital">subject</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισαγωγή</span> is looked upon by Beza, Castellio, Pareus, Piscator, Schlichting, Owen, Seb. Schmidt, Carpzov, Whitby, Michaelis, Semler, Ernesti, Valckenaer, Heinrichs, Stuart, and others. The sense would then be: the law indeed brought nothing to perfection; but the bringing in of a better hope <span class="ital">did</span> lead to perfection. Against this view, however, the consideration is decisive, that in such case, inasmuch as the preceding <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> has the article, <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισαγωγή</span> also must have obtained the article.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The statement of <a href="/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.">Hebrews 7:18</a> is to be understood in special relation to the subject in question (not, as is done by Schlichting, Heinrichs, and others, as a truth of universal import).
