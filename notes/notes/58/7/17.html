That there is such a change is plain. The law which made the Levitical priesthood, showed that the priests were frail, dying creatures, not able to save their own lives, much less could they save the souls of those who came to them. But the High Priest of our profession holds his office by the power of endless life in himself; not only to keep himself alive, but to give spiritual and eternal life to all who rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. The better covenant, of which Jesus was the Surety, is not here contrasted with the covenant of works, by which every transgressor is shut up under the curse. It is distinguished from the Sinai covenant with Israel, and the legal dispensation under which the church so long remained. The better covenant brought the church and every believer into clearer light, more perfect liberty, and more abundant privileges. In the order of Aaron there was a multitude of priests, of high priests one after another; but in the priesthood of Christ there is only one and the same. This is the believer's safety and happiness, that this everlasting High Priest is able to save to the uttermost, in all times, in all cases. Surely then it becomes us to desire a spirituality and holiness, as much beyond those of the Old Testament believers, as our advantages exceed theirs.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he testifieth - "That this is the true account of it is proved by the testimony of God himself, that he was to be a priest for ever;" see the note on <a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

On the one hand there is an <span class="greekheb">ἀθέτησις προαγούσης ἐντολῆς</span>, “a setting aside of a foregoing enactment,” that namely which is referred to in <a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm" title="For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 7:17</a>, and on the other hand, there is “a further bringing in of a better hope”. <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισαγωγὴ κρείττονος ἐλπίδος</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> in <span class="greekheb">ἐπεισαγωγή</span> balances <span class="greekheb">προαγούσης</span>, and indicates that the better hope was introduced over and above all that had already been done in the same behalf of bringing men to God. The <span class="greekheb">μὲν</span> … <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> indicate that the sentence must thus be construed, and not as rendered in A.V. The reason of this replacement of the old legal enactment is given in the clause, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ αὐτῆς ἀσθενὲς καὶ ἀνωφελές</span> “on account of its weakness and uselessness”. This arrangement depending on the flesh was helpless to achieve the most spiritual of achievements, the union of man with God, the bringing together in true spiritual fellowship of sinful and earthly man with the holy God. So Paul found that arrangements of a mechanical and external nature were <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενῆ καὶ πτωχὰ στοιχεῖα</span>, <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>. “The <span class="ital">uselessness</span> (unhelplessness) of the priesthood was proved by its inability to aid men in that <span class="greekheb">ἐγγίζειν τῷ Θεῷ</span>, which is their one want” (Vaughan). The ordinance regulating the priesthood failed to accomplish its object; and indeed this characterised the entire system of which it was a characteristic part. <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲν γὰρ ἐτελείωσεν ὁ νόμος</span>, “for nothing was brought to perfection by the law”. The law made beginnings, taught rudiments, gave initial impulses, hinted, foreshadowed, but brought nothing to perfection, did not in itself provide for man’s perfect entrance into God’s fellowship. Therefore there was introduced that which did achieve in perfect form this reconcilement with God, <span class="ital">viz</span>.: a better hope, which is therefore defined as <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἧς ἐγγίζομεν τῷ Θεῷ</span>, “by which we draw near to God”. The law said (<a href="/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21</a>) <span class="greekheb">διαμάρτυραι τῷ λαῷ μήποτε ἐγγίσωσι πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span>. The “better” hope is that which springs from belief in the indestructible life of Christ and the assurance that that life is still active in the priestly function of intercession. It is the hope that is anchored within the veil fixed in Christ’s person and therefore bringing us into God’s presence and fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">he testifieih</span>] Rather, “he is testified of.”</body></html>
