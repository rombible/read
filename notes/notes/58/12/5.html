By the sin that does so easily beset us, understand that sin to which we are most prone, or to which we are most exposed, from habit, age, or circumstances. This is a most important exhortation; for while a man's darling sin, be it what it will, remains unsubdued, it will hinder him from running the Christian race, as it takes from him every motive for running, and gives power to every discouragement. When weary and faint in their minds, let them recollect that the holy Jesus suffered, to save them from eternal misery. By stedfastly looking to Jesus, their thoughts would strengthen holy affections, and keep under their carnal desires. Let us then frequently consider him. What are our little trials to his agonies, or even to our deserts? What are they to the sufferings of many others? There is a proneness in believers to grow weary, and to faint under trials and afflictions; this is from the imperfection of grace and the remains of corruption. Christians should not faint under their trials. Though their enemies and persecutors may be instruments to inflict sufferings, yet they are Divine chastisements; their heavenly Father has his hand in all, and his wise end to answer by all. They must not make light of afflictions, and be without feeling under them, for they are the hand and rod of God, and are his rebukes for sin. They must not despond and sink under trials, nor fret and repine, but bear up with faith and patience. God may let others alone in their sins, but he will correct sin in his own children. In this he acts as becomes a father. Our earthly parents sometimes may chasten us, to gratify their passion, rather than to reform our manners. But the Father of our souls never willingly grieves nor afflicts his children. It is always for our profit. Our whole life here is a state of childhood, and imperfect as to spiritual things; therefore we must submit to the discipline of such a state. When we come to a perfect state, we shall be fully reconciled to all God's chastisement of us now. God's correction is not condemnation; the chastening may be borne with patience, and greatly promote holiness. Let us then learn to consider the afflictions brought on us by the malice of men, as corrections sent by our wise and gracious Father, for our spiritual good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And ye have forgotten the exhortation - This exhortation is found in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>. The object of the apostle in introducing it here is, to show that afflictions were designed on the part of God to produce some happy effects in the lives of his people, and that they ought, therefore, to bear them patiently. In the previous verses, he directs them to the example of the Saviour. In this verse and the following, for the same object he directs their attention to the design of trials, showing that they are necessary to our welfare, and that they are in fact proof of the paternal care of God. This verse might be rendered as a question. "And have ye forgotten?" etc. This mode of rendering it will agree somewhat better with the design of the apostle.<p>Which speaketh, unto you - Which may be regarded as addressed to you; or which involves a principle as applicable to you as to others. He does not mean that when Solomon used the words, he had reference to them particularly, but that he used them with reference to the children of God, and they might therefore be applied to them. in this way we may regard the language of the Scriptures as addressed to us.<p>As unto children - As if he were addressing children. The language is such as a father uses.<p>My son - It is possible that in these words Solomon may have intended to address a son literally, giving him paternal counsel; or he may have spoken as the Head of the Jewish people, designing to address all the pious, to whom he sustained, as it were, the relation of a father. Or, it is possible also, that it may be regarded as the language of God himself addressing his children. Whichever supposition is adopted, the sense is substantially the same.<p>Despise not thou the chastening of the Lord - Literally, "Do not regard it as a small matter, or as a trivial thing -  &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  oligo&#772;rei. The Greek word used here does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The word rendered here "chastening" - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  paideia - and also in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-8</a>, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-9.htm">Hebrews 12:9</a>, "corrected" - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;  paideutas - does not refer to affliction in general, but that kind of affliction which is designed to correct us for our faults, or which is of the nature of discipline. The verb properly relates to the training up of a child - including instruction, counsel, discipline, and correction (see this use of the verb in <a href="/acts/7-22.htm">Acts 7:22</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>), and then especially discipline or correction for faults - to "correct, chastise, chasten;" <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>. This is the meaning here; and the idea is, not that God will afflict his people in general, but that if they wander away he will correct them for their faults. He will bring calamity upon them as a punishment for their offences, and in order to bring them back to himself. He will not suffer them to wander away unrebuked and unchecked, but will mercifully reclaim them though by great sufferings. Afflictions have many objects, or produce many happy effects. That referred to here is, that they are means of reclaiming the wandering and erring children of God, and are proofs of his paternal care and love; compare <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13-14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-31.htm">Psalm 89:31-34</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>. Afflictions, which are always sent by God, should not be regarded as small matters, for these reasons:<p>(1) The fact that they are sent by God. Whatever he does is of importance, and is worthy of the profound attention of people.<p>(2) they are sent for some important purpose, and they should be regarded, therefore, with attentive concern.<p>Men "despise" them when:<p>(1) they treat them with affected or real unconcern;<p>(2) when they fail to receive them as divine admonitions, and regard them as without any intelligent design; and,<p>(3) when they receive them with "expressions" of contempt, and speak of them and of the government of God with scorn.<p>It should be a matter of deep concern when we are afflicted in any manner, not to treat the matter lightly, but to derive from our trials all the lessons which they are adapted to produce on the mind.<p>Nor faint ... - Bear up patiently under them. This is the second duty. We are first to study their character and design; and secondly, to bear up under them, however severe they may be, and however long they may be continued.

Compare Heb 12:15-17, in which he implies how utterly some of them had forgotten God's word. His exhortation ought to have more effect on you than the cheers and exhortations of the spectators have on the competitors striving in the games.<p>which&#8212;Greek, "the which," of which the following is a specimen [Alford].<p>speaketh unto you&#8212;as in a dialogue or discourse, so the Greek, implying God's loving condescension (compare Isa 1:18).<p>despise not&#8212;literally, "Do not hold of little account." Betraying a contumacious spirit of unbelief (Heb 3:12), as "faint" implies a broken-down, weak, and desponding spirit. "Chastening" is to be borne with "subjection" (Heb 12:9); "rebuke" (more severe than chastening) is to be borne with endurance (Heb 12:7). "Some in adversity kick against God's will, others despond; neither is to be done by the Christian, who is peculiarly the child of God. To him such adverse things occur only by the decree of God, and that designed in kindness, namely, to remove the defilements adhering to the believer, and to exercise his patience" [Grotius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And ye have forgotten; </span> eklelhsye, whether rendered interrogatively: have ye forgotten?

This, by their conduct, the apostle feared they had forgotten, and therefore puts them in mind of it; or it may be read by way of question, "and have ye forgotten?", &amp;c. do not ye remember? it would be right to call it to mind: <p>which speaketh unto you as unto children; not as the children of Solomon, but as the children of God, or of Christ, the wisdom of God: here, by a prosopopeia, the word of exhortation is introduced as a person speaking, <p>my son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord; by which is meant, not vindictive punishment; this would not be speaking to them, nor dealing with them as children, and would be contrary to the love of God towards them; besides, chastisement in this sense has been upon Christ for them, and it would be unjust to lay it on them again; but a fatherly correction is designed, and which is given in love by God, as a Father, and for the instruction of his children, as the word used signifies: and it is called not the chastening of men, but of the Lord; every chastening, or afflictive providence, is appointed by God, and is looked upon by believers, when grace is in exercise, as coming from him; and it is directed, and governed, and limited by him, and is overruled by him for his own glory, and their good: and this is not to be despised, as something nauseous and loathsome, or as not useful and unprofitable, or as insignificant and unworthy of notice, but should be esteemed for the good ends, which are sometimes answered, by it: <p>nor faint when thou art rebuked of him; God has various ways of rebuking, reproving, and convincing, sometimes by his Spirit, sometimes by his word and ministers, and sometimes by afflictive providences; by these he rebukes his people for their sins, convinces them of them, and brings them to acknowledgment and confession; he makes them hereby sensible of their duty, in which they have been remiss, and brings them to a more constant and fervent discharge of it; he reproves them for, and convinces of their folly in trusting in the creature, or loving it too much, and of every wrong way they have been walking in; and these rebukes are not in a way of wrath, but love, and therefore saints should not faint at them: there are two extremes they are apt to run into, under such a dispensation; either to take no notice, and make light of an affliction, or else to be overwhelmed by it, and sink under it; both are guarded against in this exhortation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</span><p>(5) Secondly, because they are testimonies of his fatherly good will towards us, in that they show themselves to be illegitimate, if they cannot abide to be chastened by God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/hebrews/12-5.htm" title="And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:...">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ ἐκλέλησθε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">And have ye forgotten</span>, etc.?
