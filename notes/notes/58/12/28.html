(See Note.) The tone of the whole chapter—we might rather say, the whole Epistle—is presented in this combination of “grace” and acceptable service with awe and reverent fear. The last thought connects itself closely with the following verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:...">Hebrews 12:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore we </span>— Who believe in Christ; <span class="ital">receiving </span>— Or <span class="ital">having received, </span>through the gospel; <span class="ital">a kingdom which cannot be moved </span>— A dispensation (frequently called the kingdom of God) which shall never be changed, but shall remain to the end of time, (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-11.htm" title="For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious.">2 Corinthians 3:11</a>,) and which opens before us an assured and bright prospect of a reign in eternal glory; <span class="ital">let us have grace </span>— Let us ask and receive it. “As grace is so freely offered to us, let us not be so wanting to ourselves as to fall short of it.” So Dr. Doddridge paraphrases the clause, and adds in a note, “This” (namely, that grace is freely offered) “is strongly intimated in the words of the exhortation, else there could be no room for it. And this oblique intimation, in which it is, as it were, taken for granted that we may certainly <span class="ital">have grace </span>if we take proper methods for obtaining it, appears to me peculiarly affecting.” <span class="greekheb">Εχωμεν χαριν </span>may be properly rendered, <span class="ital">let us hold fast grace; </span>for it is as necessary to <span class="ital">retain </span>it as it is to <span class="ital">obtain </span>it; and this we may do as well as the other; <span class="ital">whereby we may </span>have both inclination and power to <span class="ital">serve God acceptably </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ευαρεστως</span>, in a manner <span class="ital">well pleasing </span>to him, making his will the sole rule of our conduct, of our tempers, words, and works, and his glory the end thereof, and from a principle of love to him, endeavouring to glorify him in our body and spirit which are his; <span class="ital">with reverence </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μετα αιδους</span>, literally, <span class="ital">with shame, </span>or <span class="ital">modesty, </span>arising from a deep sense of our unworthiness; <span class="ital">and godly fear </span>— A tender, jealous fear of offending God, arising from a sense of his gracious majesty. <span class="ital">For our God </span>— In the strictness of his justice, and the purity of his holiness; <span class="ital">is a consuming fire </span>— Though he manifests himself in the gospel with the beams of such mild majesty, he is still possessed of that tremendous power which was so awfully displayed at mount Sinai, and will break forth as a consuming fire against all those that presumptuously violate his laws and despise his gospel. See <a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-23.htm" title="Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you....">Deuteronomy 4:23-24</a>, a passage which the apostle had now in his eye, where Moses, giving the Lord this appellation, reminded the Israelites of the fire which came forth from him to destroy Korah and his company, <a href="/numbers/16-35.htm" title="And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.">Numbers 16:35</a>. Wherefore, by adopting his words, the apostle brought the same instance of vengeance to the remembrance of the Hebrews, that they might be deterred from apostacy, disobedience, and all irreverence in the worship of God: who, though he appears so full of mercy in the gospel, is as much determined to punish the rebellious as ever. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:18-29 Mount Sinai, on which the Jewish church state was formed, was a mount such as might be touched, though forbidden to be so, a place that could be felt; so the Mosaic dispensation was much in outward and earthly things. The gospel state is kind and condescending, suited to our weak frame. Under the gospel all may come with boldness to God's presence. But the most holy must despair, if judged by the holy law given from Sinai, without a Saviour. The gospel church is called Mount Zion; there believers have clearer views of heaven, and more heavenly tempers of soul. All the children of God are heirs, and every one has the privileges of the first-born. Let a soul be supposed to join that glorious assembly and church above, that is yet unacquainted with God, still carnally-minded, loving this present world and state of things, looking back to it with a lingering eye, full of pride and guile, filled with lusts; such a soul would seem to have mistaken its way, place, state, and company. It would be uneasy to itself and all about it. Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant, between God and man, to bring them together in this covenant; to keep them together; to plead with God for us, and to plead with us for God; and at length to bring God and his people together in heaven. This covenant is made firm by the blood of Christ sprinkled upon our consciences, as the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar and the victim. This blood of Christ speaks in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for vengeance, but for mercy. See then that you refuse not his gracious call and offered salvation. See that you do not refuse Him who speaketh from heaven, with infinite tenderness and love; for how can those escape, who turn from God in unbelief or apostacy, while he so graciously beseeches them to be reconciled, and to receive his everlasting favour! God's dealing with men under the gospel, in a way of grace, assures us, that he will deal with the despisers of the gospel, in a way of judgment. We cannot worship God acceptably, unless we worship him with reverence and godly fear. Only the grace of God enables us to worship God aright. God is the same just and righteous God under the gospel as under the law. The inheritance of believers is secured to them; and all things pertaining to salvation are freely given in answer to prayer. Let us seek for grace, that we may serve God with reverence and godly fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved - We who are Christians. We pertain to a kingdom that is permanent and unchanging. The meaning is, that the kingdom of the Redeemer is never to pass away. It is not like the Jewish dispensation, to give place to another, nor is there any power that can destroy it; see the notes on <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>. It has now endured for eighteen hundred years, amidst all the revolutions on earth, and in spite of all the attempts which have been made to destroy it; and it is now as vigorous and stable as it ever was. The past has shown that there is no power of earth or hell that can destroy it, and that in the midst of all revolutions this kingdom still survives. Its great principles and laws will endure on earth to the end of time, and will be made permanent in heaven. This is the only kingdom in which we can be certain that there will be no revolution; the only empire which is destined never to fall.<p>Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God - Margin, "let us hold fast." The Greek is, literally, let us have grace; the meaning is, "let us hold fast the grace or favor which we have received in being admitted to the privileges of that kingdom." The object of the apostle is, to keep them in the reverent fear and service of God. The "argument" which he presents is, that this kingdom is permanent. There is no danger of its being overthrown. It is to continue on earth to the end of time; it is to be established in heaven forever. If it were temporary, changeable, liable to be overthrown at any moment, there would be much less encouragement to perseverance. But in a kingdom like this there is every encouragement, for there is the assurance:<p>(1) that all our interests there are safe;<p>(2) that all our exertions will be crowned with ultimate success,<p>(3) that the efforts which we make to do good will have a permanent influence on mankind, and will bless future ages; and<p>(4) that the reward is certain.<p>A man subject to a government about whose continuance there would be the utmost uncertainty, would have little encouragement to labor with a view to any permanent interest. In a government where nothing is settled; where all policy is changing, and where there are constantly vacillating plans, there is no inducement to enter on any enterprise demanding time and risk. But where the policy is settled; where the principles and the laws are firm; where there is evidence of permanency, there is the highest encouragement. The highest possible encouragement of this kind is in the permanent and established kingdom of God. All other governments may be revolutionized; this never will be - all others may have a changeful policy; this has none - all others will be overthrown; this never will.<p>With reverence and godly fear - With true veneration for God, and with pious devotedness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. receiving&#8212;as we do, in prospect and sure hope, also in the possession of the Spirit the first-fruits.

Not the kingdom of glory; eternal glory is a kingdom, and it is an immovable one; and is a free gift of God, and may be said to be now received; God's people are called unto it, and are made meet for it, and have a right unto it, and have it in faith and hope, and in Christ their head and representative: but the kingdom of grace, under the Gospel dispensation, is meant: there are several things in this dispensation which are called a kingdom; as a Gospel church, the Gospel itself, and the privileges and blessings of grace bestowed, especially spiritual and internal ones, <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a> and the whole dispensation is called the kingdom of heaven, <a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>.

Its fundamental idea is timid apprehension of danger; while &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is the terror which seizes one when the danger appears. Schmidt (Synon. 139, 10) illustrates happily. In a primitive forest an undefined sense of possible danger possesses one, and makes his heart beat quickly at every rustle of a leaf. This is &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. When the voice and tread of a wild beast are distinctly heard close at hand, the &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; becomes &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The phrase "with pious care and fear" is not explanatory of acceptably. These are to accompany (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;) acceptable service. They do not imply a cringing or slavish feeling, but grow out of the warning in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>, which runs through the two following verses, and implies that the catastrophe of <a href="/hebrews/12-27.htm">Hebrews 12:27</a> will be final, leaving no more opportunity to retrieve the refusal of God's invitation to the privileges of the new covenant, or the relapse into the superseded economy of Judaism. </body></html>
