By the sin that does so easily beset us, understand that sin to which we are most prone, or to which we are most exposed, from habit, age, or circumstances. This is a most important exhortation; for while a man's darling sin, be it what it will, remains unsubdued, it will hinder him from running the Christian race, as it takes from him every motive for running, and gives power to every discouragement. When weary and faint in their minds, let them recollect that the holy Jesus suffered, to save them from eternal misery. By stedfastly looking to Jesus, their thoughts would strengthen holy affections, and keep under their carnal desires. Let us then frequently consider him. What are our little trials to his agonies, or even to our deserts? What are they to the sufferings of many others? There is a proneness in believers to grow weary, and to faint under trials and afflictions; this is from the imperfection of grace and the remains of corruption. Christians should not faint under their trials. Though their enemies and persecutors may be instruments to inflict sufferings, yet they are Divine chastisements; their heavenly Father has his hand in all, and his wise end to answer by all. They must not make light of afflictions, and be without feeling under them, for they are the hand and rod of God, and are his rebukes for sin. They must not despond and sink under trials, nor fret and repine, but bear up with faith and patience. God may let others alone in their sins, but he will correct sin in his own children. In this he acts as becomes a father. Our earthly parents sometimes may chasten us, to gratify their passion, rather than to reform our manners. But the Father of our souls never willingly grieves nor afflicts his children. It is always for our profit. Our whole life here is a state of childhood, and imperfect as to spiritual things; therefore we must submit to the discipline of such a state. When we come to a perfect state, we shall be fully reconciled to all God's chastisement of us now. God's correction is not condemnation; the chastening may be borne with patience, and greatly promote holiness. Let us then learn to consider the afflictions brought on us by the malice of men, as corrections sent by our wise and gracious Father, for our spiritual good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For consider him - Attentively reflect on his example that you may be able to bear your trials in a proper manner.<p>That endured such contradiction of sinners - Such opposition. The reference is to the Jews of the time of the Saviour, who opposed his plans, perverted his sayings, and ridiculed his claims. Yet, regardless of their opposition, he persevered in the course which he had marked out, and went patiently forward in the execution of his plans. The idea is, that we are to pursue the path of duty and follow the dictates of conscience, let the world say what they will about it. In doing this we cannot find a better example than the Saviour. No opposition of sinners ever turned him from the way which he regarded as right; no ridicule ever caused him to abandon any of his plans; no argument, or expression of scorn, ever caused him for a moment to deviate from his course.<p>Lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds - The meaning is, that there is great danger of being disheartened and wearied out by the opposition which you meet with. But with the bright example of one who was never disheartened, and who never became weary in doing the will of God, you may persevere. The best means of leading a faithful Christian life amidst the opposition which we may encounter, is to keep the eye steadily fixed on the Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

In the greatness of his person, as God, the Son of God, the heir of all things; and in his offices of prophet, priest, and King, as the Saviour of lost sinners, the Leader and Commander of the people, as the apostle and high priest of our profession: consider him in his human nature, his conversation on earth, and what he did and suffered for men; how that in his nature he was pure and holy, in his conversation harmless and innocent, in his deportment meek and lowly; who went about doing good to the souls of men, and at last suffered and died, and is now glorified: consider the analogy between him and us, and how great is the disproportion; and therefore if he was ill treated, no wonder we should consider him under all his reproaches and sufferings: <p>that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself; against his person, they denying his deity, and speaking against his sonship, and against his offices; mocking him as a King, deriding him as a prophet, and treating him with the utmost contempt as a priest and Saviour; and against his actions, his works of mercy to the bodies of men, when done on the sabbath day; his conversing with sinners for the good of their souls, as if he was an encourager of them in sin, and a partner with them; his miracles, as if they were done by the help of the devil; and against the whole series of his life, as if it was criminal. Now we should analogize this contradiction, and see what proportion there is between this, and what is endured by us: we should consider the aggravations of it, that it was "against himself"; sometimes it was against his disciples, and him through them, as it is now against his members, and him in them; but here it was immediately and directly against himself: and this he endured "from sinners"; some more secret, as the Scribes, Sadducees, and Pharisees; some more open, as the common people; some of them the vilest of sinners, the most abandoned of creatures, as the Roman soldiers, and Herod's men of war: and this should be considered, that we cannot be contradicted by viler or meaner persons; and it is worthy of notice, with what courage and bravery of mind, with what patience and invincible constancy he endured it: this should be recollected for imitation and encouragement, <p>lest ye be wearied, and faint in your minds; contradiction is apt to make persons weary and faint, as Rebekah was, because of the daughters of Heth, and as Jeremiah was, because of the derision of the Jews, <a href="/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a> but a consideration of Jesus, and of what he has endured, tends to relieve the saints in such a condition; See <a href="/matthew/10-25.htm">Matthew 10:25</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</span><p>(3) An amplification, taken from the circumstance of the person and the things themselves, which he compares between themselves: for how great is Jesus in comparison of us, and how far more grievous things did he suffer than we?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm" title="For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.">Hebrews 12:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γάρ</span>] is here, on account of the imperative, the corroborative: <span class="ital">Yea!</span> (comp.

Fr.

That reason being found in the <span class="greekheb">τοιαύτην</span>. This so great contumely and opposition endured by Jesus the Hebrews are to consider, “to bring into analogy, think of by comparing” with their own and so renew their hopeful endurance. <span class="greekheb">τὸν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλογίαν</span>, “Him who has endured at the hands of sinners such contradiction against Himself.” The desire on the part of several interpreters to put a stronger meaning into <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλογία</span>—although quite unsupported by usage—reveals a feeling that verbal abuse or contradiction was a much less severe trial than such as are enumerated in chap. 11. But not only was it this <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλογία</span> which brought Christ to the cross and formed the <span class="greekheb">αἰσχύνη</span> of it, but it was the repudiation of His claims throughout His life which formed the chief element in His trial. It was predicted (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm" title="And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;">Luke 2:34</a>) that He would be a <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον ἀντιλεγόμενον</span>, full of significance misinterpreted, full of God rejected. It was precisely this general rejection and contempt from which the Hebrews were themselves suffering. They were finding how hard it was to maintain a solitary faith contradicted and scorned by public sentiment. Think then, says this writer, of Him who has endured at the hands of sinners so much more painful contradiction “against Himself”. <span class="greekheb">ἴνα μὴ κάμητε</span> … “that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls”. <span class="greekheb">ψυχαῖς</span> may be construed either with <span class="greekheb">κάμητε</span> or with <span class="greekheb">ἐκλυόμενοι</span>; better with the latter. [Polybius, xx. 4, 7, speaking of the demoralisation of the Boeotians says that giving themselves up to eating and drinking, <span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον ταῖς σώμασιν ἐξελύθησαν ἀλλὰ καὶ ταῖς ψυχαῖς</span>.]<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">consider</span>] Lit., “compare yourselves with.” Contrast the comparative immunity from anguish of your lot with the agony of His (<a href="/john/15-20.htm" title="Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord.

Three uncials (<span class="greekheb">א</span>, D, E) read “against <span class="ital">themselves</span>.” Christ was a mark for incessant “contradiction,”—“a sign which is spoken against” (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm" title="And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;">Luke 2:34</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds</span>] The correction of the R. V., “<span class="ital">that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls</span>,” will be reckoned by careless and prejudiced readers among the changes which they regard as meaningless. Yet, as in hundreds of other instances, it brings out much more fully and forcibly the exact meaning of the original. “<span class="ital">That ye wax not weary</span>” is substituted for “lest ye be weary” because the Greek verb, being in the aorist, suggests a <span class="ital">sudden</span> or momentary break-down in endurance; on the other hand, “fainting” is in the present, and suggests the <span class="ital">gradual</span> relaxation of nerve and energy which culminates in the sudden relapse. Lastly the word in the original is “souls,” not “minds.” Endurance was one of the most needful Christian virtues in times of waiting and of trial (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm" title="For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.">Hebrews 12:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀναλογίσασθε</span>) <span class="ital">consider</span>, by instituting a <span class="ital">comparison</span>.
