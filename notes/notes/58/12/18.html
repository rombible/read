Had this word been in the sentence as originally written, its absence from all our more ancient authorities would be inexplicable; whilst, on the other hand, the contrast with <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>, and the recollection of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm" title="And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>, from which the last words in this verse are taken, would very naturally lead a transcriber to supply this word, which he might suppose to have accidentally dropped out of the text. If, however, the writer did not make use of the word here, though the contrast of <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a> was already before his mind, it seems certain that the word was not in his thought; and hence we have no right to introduce it in the explanation of the verse. The true translation, in all probability, is as follows: <span class= "ital">For ye are not come unto a material</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">a palpable</span>)<span class= "ital"> and kindled fire, and unto gloom and darkness and tempest.</span> The object of the writer is to set forth the terrors which accompanied the giving of the Law,—that which the awe-stricken people saw and heard. Not the mount, but the terrible fire was that which met their gaze. Thus again and again in Deuteronomy we find reference to the voice and the fire alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-33.htm" title="Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?">Deuteronomy 4:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-36.htm" title="Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.">Deuteronomy 4:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-4.htm" title="The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/5-25.htm" title="Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.">Deuteronomy 5:25-26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-16.htm" title="According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>). Shortly before “the day of the assembly” in Horeb Israel had been led by “a pillar of fire” (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>); in <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a> of this chapter the figure of “a consuming fire” is applied to God Himself. To avoid such associations as these, and vividly to represent what then was shown to the Israelites, he speaks of “a material and kindled fire.” The metaphor in “palpable” as applied to fire is hardly more remarkable than that involved in “a darkness which may be felt” (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.">Exodus 10:21</a>, where the word used in the LXX. is almost the same as that which we have here).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/hebrews/12-18.htm" title="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,...">Hebrews 12:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — As if he had said, Take heed of apostatizing from Christianity to Judaism again, because of the great privileges you enjoy by the gospel above what your fathers enjoyed by the law: which privileges contain a strong reason why you should attend to these exhortations and cautions; <span class="ital">ye </span>— Who are proselyted to Christianity; <span class="ital">are not come unto the mount that might </span>— Or could; <span class="ital">be touched </span>— That is, of an earthly, material, or tangible nature; but which the people were prohibited to approach, and much more to touch. <span class="ital">And that burned with fire</span> — Unto the midst of heaven, (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm" title="And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>,) to show that God is a consuming fire to the impenitent; <span class="ital">and to blackness and darkness </span>— An emblem of the obscurity of the Mosaic dispensation; <span class="ital">and to tempest — </span>Josephus tells us, (<span class="ital">Antiq., </span>lib. 3. c. 5,) that at the giving of the law strong winds came down, and manifested the presence of God. “Perhaps,” says Macknight, “this prefigured what happened when the new law, the gospel, was given. For, previous to the descent of the Holy Ghost, <span class="ital">there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty </span>rushing wind: <span class="ital">and the sound of a trumpet </span>— Formed, without doubt, by the ministry of angels, and which at length waxed <span class="ital">exceeding loud, </span>(<a href="/context/exodus/19-18.htm" title="And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly....">Exodus 19:18-19</a>,) preparatory to <span class="ital">the voice of words </span>— That is, the ten commandments, written afterward on the two tables of stone. For (all other noises, as of thunder, the trumpet, &c., ceasing) God caused a loud voice, speaking those ten commandments articulately in their own language, to be heard by the whole congregation, men, women, and children, in the station wherein they were placed at the foot of the mount; and this voice was so great and terrible that the people were not able to bear it: for although they were terrified with the dreadful appearances on the mount, yet was it this speaking of God that utterly overwhelmed them. See <a href="/deuteronomy/5-22.htm" title="These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly in the mount out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>. <span class="ital">Which they that heard </span>— Namely, the whole assembly or congregation, strongly impressed with the holiness and power of their Lawgiver and Judge, and being exceedingly terrified; <span class="ital">entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more</span> — Or that the word or speaking of God to them should not be continued.

The meaning is, they deprecated the hearing of the word in that manner any more, which they did doubtless by their officers and elders, who both themselves being terrified, and observing the dread of the whole congregation, made request for themselves and the rest to Moses; and because they did it with a good intention, out of reverence for the majesty of God, without any design of declining obedience, it was accepted.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:18-29 Mount Sinai, on which the Jewish church state was formed, was a mount such as might be touched, though forbidden to be so, a place that could be felt; so the Mosaic dispensation was much in outward and earthly things. The gospel state is kind and condescending, suited to our weak frame. Under the gospel all may come with boldness to God's presence. But the most holy must despair, if judged by the holy law given from Sinai, without a Saviour. The gospel church is called Mount Zion; there believers have clearer views of heaven, and more heavenly tempers of soul. All the children of God are heirs, and every one has the privileges of the first-born. Let a soul be supposed to join that glorious assembly and church above, that is yet unacquainted with God, still carnally-minded, loving this present world and state of things, looking back to it with a lingering eye, full of pride and guile, filled with lusts; such a soul would seem to have mistaken its way, place, state, and company. It would be uneasy to itself and all about it. Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant, between God and man, to bring them together in this covenant; to keep them together; to plead with God for us, and to plead with us for God; and at length to bring God and his people together in heaven. This covenant is made firm by the blood of Christ sprinkled upon our consciences, as the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the altar and the victim. This blood of Christ speaks in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for vengeance, but for mercy. See then that you refuse not his gracious call and offered salvation. See that you do not refuse Him who speaketh from heaven, with infinite tenderness and love; for how can those escape, who turn from God in unbelief or apostacy, while he so graciously beseeches them to be reconciled, and to receive his everlasting favour! God's dealing with men under the gospel, in a way of grace, assures us, that he will deal with the despisers of the gospel, in a way of judgment. We cannot worship God acceptably, unless we worship him with reverence and godly fear. Only the grace of God enables us to worship God aright. God is the same just and righteous God under the gospel as under the law. The inheritance of believers is secured to them; and all things pertaining to salvation are freely given in answer to prayer. Let us seek for grace, that we may serve God with reverence and godly fear.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For ye are not come - To enforce the considerations already urged, the apostle introduces this sublime comparison between the old and new dispensations; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>. The object, in accordance with the principal scope of the Epistle, is, to guard them against apostasy. To do this, he shows that under the new dispensation there was much more to hind them to fidelity, and to make apostasy dangerous, than there was under the old. The main point of the comparison is, that under the Jewish dispensation, everything was adapted to awe the mind, and to restrain by the exhibition of grandeur and of power; but that under the Christian dispensation, while there was as much that was sublime, there was much more that was adapted to win and hold the affections. There were revelations of higher truths. There were more affecting motives to lead to obedience. There was that of which the former was but the type and emblem. There was the clear revelation of the glories of heaven, and of the blessed society there, all adapted to prompt to the earnest desire that they might be our own. The considerations presented in this passage constitute the climax of the argument so beautifully pursued through this Epistle, showing that the Christian system was far superior in every respect to the Jewish. In presenting this closing argument, the apostle first refers to some of the circumstances attending the former dispensation which were designed to keep the people of God from apostasy, and then the considerations of superior weight existing under the Christian economy.<p>The mount that might be touched - Mount Sinai. The meaning here is, that "that mountain was palpable, material, touchable" - in contradistinction from the Mount Zion to which the church had now come, which is above the reach of the external senses; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>. The apostle does not mean that it was permitted to the Israelites to touch Mount Sinai - for this was strictly forbidden, <a href="/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12</a>; but he evidently alludes to that prohibition, and means to say that a command forbidding them to "touch" the mountain, implied that it was a material or palpable object. The sense of the passage is, that every circumstance that occurred there was suited to fill the soul with terror. Everything accompanying the giving of the Law, the setting of bounds around the mountain which they might not pass, and the darkness and tempest on the mountain itself, was adopted to overawe the soul. The phrase "the touchable mountain" - if such a phrase is proper - would express the meaning of the apostle here. The "Mount Zion" to which the church now has come, is of a different character. It is not thus visible and palpable. It is not enveloped in smoke and flame, and the thunders of the Almighty do not roll and re-echo among its lofty peaks as at Horeb; yet it presents "stronger" motives to perseverance in the service of God.<p>And that burned with fire - <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; compare <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>.<p>Nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest - see <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. For&#8212;The fact that we are not under the law, but under a higher, and that the last dispensation, the Gospel, with its glorious privileges, is the reason why especially the Hebrew Christians should "look diligently," &c.

But still, "the mount" must be supplied from Heb 12:22.<p>that might be touched&#8212;palpable and material. Not that any save Moses was allowed to touch it (Ex 19:12, 13). The Hebrews drew near to the material Mount Sinai with material bodies; we, to the spiritual mount in the spirit. The "darkness" was that formed by the clouds hanging round the mount; the "tempest" accompanied the thunder.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For</span> showeth, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/hebrews/12-18.htm" title="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,...">Hebrews 12:18-24</a></span>, the apostle enforcing on these Hebrews, and with them on all Christians, the pursuit of holiness and peace, by subjoining the great helps they have for it, beyond what the Old Testament church had, they being freed from the legal dispensation, which was less helpful to it, and admitted to that of the gospel, most promoting it.

The design of the apostle in the following words is, in general, to engage the Hebrews to adhere closely to the Gospel, from the consideration of the superior excellency of it to the law; and in particular, to enforce his former exhortations to cheerfulness under afflictions; to an upright walk in the ways of God; to follow peace with all men, even with the Gentiles, and holiness both of heart and life; and to value the doctrine of the Gospel; and to take heed that none fail of it, or act unbecoming it: and here the apostle observes, what the believing Hebrews were not come to, being delivered from it, namely, the legal dispensation, which was their privilege; the happiness of which as expressed by a detail of particular circumstances, which attended the giving of the law to the Jews: it was given on a "mount which might be touched"; that is, by God, who descended on it, and by, touching it caused it to smoke, quake, and move, <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>.

This also may denote the majesty of God, who was then present; the terror of that dispensation; the horrible curses of the law; and the great confusion and disquietude raised by it in the conscience of a sinner. <p>(d) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 5. sect. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> For ye are not come unto the mount that might be <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span><p>(12) Now he applies the same exhortation to the prophetic and kingly office of Christ compared with Moses, after this sort.

To the endeavour after sanctification the readers are bound, by the constitution of that New Covenant to which they have come. While the Old Covenant bore the character of the sensuous, earthly, and that which awakens merely fear, the New Covenant has the character of the spiritual, heavenly, brings into communion with God and all saints, and confers reconciliation (<a href="/context/hebrews/12-18.htm" title="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,...">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>).

In this paragraph we have the climax of the Epistle. Its doctrine and its exhortation alike culminate here. The great aim of the writer has been to persuade the Hebrews to hearken to the word spoken by God in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>, <a href="/context/hebrews/2-1.htm" title="Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip....">Hebrews 2:1-4</a>). This aim he still seeks to attain by bringing before his readers in one closing picture the contrast between the old dispensation and the new. The old was characterised by material, sensible transitory manifestations; the new by what is supersensible and eternally stable. The old also rather emphasised the inaccessible nature of God, His unapproachable holiness, His awful majesty, and taught men that they could not come near; the new brings men into the very presence of God, and though He be “Judge of all” yet is He surrounded with the spirits of perfected men. But as the writer seeks to quicken his readers to a more zealous faith He shows also the awful consequences of refusing Him that speaketh from heaven. Not the fire and smoke of Sinai threaten now to consume the disobedient, but “our God is a consuming fire”; not a symbolic and material element threatened, but the very Eternal and All-pervading Himself. And, returning to the idea with which he commenced the Epistle and so making its unity obvious, the writer contrasts the voice that shook the earth with the infinitely more terrible voice that shakes the heavens also, that terminates time and brings in eternal things.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18–29</span>.

If so, the main purpose of the word is to contrast the local and palpable mountain of the Law with the ideal Mount Zion which is afterwards spoken cf. Or, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> may here carry with it its common sense of groping after, as in the dark (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), with reference to the cloudy darkness about Sinai, and in contrast with the clear unclouded vision of Zion. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Following this allusion to Esau, and perhaps suggested by it, is a passage setting forth the privileges of the Christian birthright and of Christian citizenship in contrast with those under the old covenant.<p>The mount that might be touched and that burned with fire (&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>&#x39f;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; mount is omitted by the best texts, but should be understood. &#x3a8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; is rare in N.T. and lxx; fairly frequent in Class. Radically, it is akin to &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, to rub, wipe; hence feeling on the surface, as <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-12.htm">Genesis 27:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-21.htm">Genesis 27:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-22.htm">Genesis 27:22</a>, lxx: a touch which communicates only a superficial effect. It need not imply contact with an object at all, but simply the movement of the hands feeling after something. Hence often of the groping of the blind, as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a>; <a href="/job/5-14.htm">Job 5:14</a>. Appropriate here as indicating mere superficial contact. The present participle that is being touched, means simply that the mountain was something material and tangible. The A.V. which might be touched, although not literally correct, conveys the true sense.<p>That burned with fire (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>See <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-4.htm">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15</a>. The participle is passive, set on fire; kindled with fire: not attributive of &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;, enkindled fire.<p>Blackness, darkness, tempest (&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#837;, &#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#837;, &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>&#x393;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (N.T.o) and &#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (elsewhere only 2 Peter nd Jude) belong to the same family. As distinguished from &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; darkness that conceals, as opposed to light, these words signify half-darkness, gloom, nebulousness; as the darkness of evening or the gathering gloom of death. It is a darkness which does not entirely conceal color. Thus &#x3b4;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the earlier and poetic form of &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, is used by Homer of water which appears dark against the underlying rock, or is tinged by mire. &#x393;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; appear together, <a href="/exodus/10-22.htm">Exodus 10:22</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-20.htm">Exodus 14:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>. &#x393;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; alone, <a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>. &#x396;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; only in the later version of Symmachus. See on <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>. &#x398;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; N.T.o , from &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to boil or foam. It is a brief, violent, sudden, destructive blast, sometimes working upward and carrying objects into the upper air; hence found with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to lift and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to snatch up (see Hom. Od. xx. 63). It may also come from above and dash down to the ground (Hom. Il. xii. 253). Sometimes it indicates the mere force of the wind, as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; (Hom. Od. xii. 409; Il. vi. 346). </body></html>
