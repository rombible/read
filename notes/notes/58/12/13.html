this separation, however, the Greek will not allow. If the words be rendered, “that what is lame may not be turned out of the way, but may rather be healed,” we cannot but feel that the two members are somewhat incongruous. It is probable, therefore, that the first verb here bears the meaning which it not unfrequently has in medical writers, <span class= "ital">be put out of joint.</span> Let the paths (or tracks) which you follow be straight, for crooked and uneven paths will make the limbs which are lame more helpless still; should nothing aggravate the hurt that has been received, it may soon be healed. In the application, the words are a warning against the shifting courses of men who are ready to turn aside from strict duty when persecution threatens, and seek to avert the danger by compliance with what they do not in heart approve. Whatever may be the result in the case of “the strong” (<a href="/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a>; 1 Corinthians 8), the example brings destruction on “the weak.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:12-17 A burden of affliction is apt to make the Christian's hands hang down, and his knees grow feeble, to dispirit him and discourage him; but against this he must strive, that he may better run his spiritual race and course. Faith and patience enable believers to follow peace and holiness, as a man follows his calling constantly, diligently, and with pleasure. Peace with men, of all sects and parties, will be favourable to our pursuit of holiness. But peace and holiness go together; there can be not right peace without holiness. Where persons fail of having the true grace of God, corruption will prevail and break forth; beware lest any unmortified lust in the heart, which seems to be dead, should spring up, to trouble and disturb the whole body. Falling away from Christ is the fruit of preferring the delights of the flesh, to the blessing of God, and the heavenly inheritance, as Esau did. But sinners will not always have such mean thoughts of the Divine blessing and inheritance as they now have. It agrees with the profane man's disposition, to desire the blessing, yet to despise the means whereby the blessing is to be gained. But God will neither sever the means from the blessing, nor join the blessing with the satisfying of man's lusts. God's mercy and blessing were never sought carefully and not obtained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And make straight paths for your feet - Margin, "even." The word used here means properly straight, in the sense of upright, erect; <a href="/acts/14-10.htm">Acts 14:10</a>; but it is used here in the sense of straight horizontally, that is, level, plain, smooth. The meaning is, that they were to remove all obstacles out of the way, so that they need not stumble and fail. There is probably an allusion here to <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>. "Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil." The idea is, that by every proper means they were to make the way to heaven as plain and easy as possible. They were to allow no obstructions in the path over which the lame and feeble might fall.<p>Lest that which is lame be turned out of the way - A lame man needs a smooth path to walk in. The idea is here, that everything which would prevent those in the church who were in any danger of falling - the feeble, the unestablished, the weak - from walking in the path to heaven, or which might be an occasion to them of falling, should be removed. Or it may mean, that in a road that was not level, those who were lame would be in danger of spraining, distorting, or wrenching a lame limb; and the counsel is, that whatever would have a tendency to this should be removed. Divested of the figure, the passage means, that everything should be removed which would hinder anyone from walking in the path to life.<p>But let it rather be healed - As in the case of lameness, pains should be taken to heal it rather than to suffer it to be increased by careless exposure to a new sprain or fracture, so it should be in our religious and moral character. Whatever is defective we should endeavor to restore to soundness, rather than to suffer the defect to be increased. Whatever is feeble in our faith or hope; whatever evil tendency there is in our hearts, we should endeavor to strengthen and amend, lest it should become worse, and we should entirely fall. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

By "feet" are meant the walk and conversation of the saints, both in the church, and in the world, Sol 7:1 and there are paths made ready for these feet to walk in; as the good old paths of truth, of the word and worship of God, of faith and holiness: and to make these paths "straight", is to make the word of God the rule of walking; to avoid carefully joining anything with it as a rule; to attend constantly on the ordinances of Christ; to go on evenly in a way of believing on him; to walk in some measure worthy of the calling wherewith we are called, and by way of example to others. <p>Lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; a lame member, as the Syriac version, a lame member of the body of Christ, the church; or a lame person, as the Arabic version, a weak believer; one that is ready to halt, either through the corruption of nature, or through the weakness of grace, or through want of light and judgment, and through instability and inconstancy; lest such an one should, through the irregular walk and conversation of others, be stumbled and offended, and go out of the way, and leave the paths of righteousness and truth. God takes care of, and has a regard to such, and he would have others also, <a href="/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>.

With regard to the purport of this verse, we observe that, while the figure of running is still continued, a new idea is introduced - that of pursuing a straight course with a view to others who are to follow on the same track. "That which is lame (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" denotes the weak and wavering brethren - the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, such as are referred to in <a href="/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. and <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. The expression well suits (specially those among the Hebrew Christians who halted between two opinions  - between the Church and the synagogue (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>;). The strong in faith ought to desire and aim at the <span class="accented">healing</span> of such lame ones, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their being strengthened in the faith, rather than expose them to the risk of apostasy by any wavering of their own. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Make straight paths for your feet (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>After the lxx of <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>.

The verb &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to be lame or to make lame (not in N.T.) is used metaphorically in lxx, <a href="/psalms/18-45.htm">Psalm 18:45</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, where the A.V.

"be put out of joint." The A.V. is according to the more usual meaning of the verb, which, in N.T., is confined, with this exception, to the Pastoral Epistles. See <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-15.htm">1 Timothy 5:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>. lxx only <a href="/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>. But it is also used by medical writers in the passive, with the meaning to be wrenched or dislocated. There is nothing strange in the use of this word in a medical sense by our writer, whose work bears the stamp of Alexandria. The Greeks received their knowledge of surgery from the Egyptians, and mural paintings and documents, and even hieroglyphic symbols, prove that that people had attained remarkable proficiency in the science. Herodotus (ch. iii. 131) mentions a medical school at Cyrene in Africa, and says that the pupils of that school were regarded as the second best physicians in all Greece. At the time of Galen (163 a.d.) the medical school of Alexandria was the most famous in the world, and Galen himself studied there. Celsus (first half of the first century a.d.), in the 7th book of his treatise De Artibius, treats of surgical operations according to the views of the Alexandrian schools. The commonly accepted rendering of the A.V., besides giving a conception which is very tame, presents two incongruities: the association of going astray with lameness, and of healing with straying. The other rendering gives a lively and consistent image. Make the paths smooth and even, so that the lame limb be not dislocated by stones or pitfalls. Do everything to avoid aggravating the weakness of a fellow-Christian. Rather try to heal it. &#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; may refer either to an individual or to a section of the church which is weak and vacillating. </body></html>
