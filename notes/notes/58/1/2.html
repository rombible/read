The manifold successive partial disclosures of God’s will have given place to one revelation, complete and final; for He who spake in the prophets hath now spoken “in a Son.” The whole stress lies on these last words. The rendering “a Son” may at first cause surprise, but it is absolutely needed; not, “<span class= "ital">Who</span> is the Revealer?” but, <span class= "ital">“What</span> is He?” is the question answered in these words. The writer does not speak of <span class= "ital">a Son</span> in the sense of one out of many; the very contrast with the prophets (who in the lower sense were amongst God’s sons) would be sufficient to prove this, but the words which follow, and the whole contents of this chapter, are designed to show the supreme dignity of Him who is God’s latest Representative on earth. The prophet’s commission extended no farther than the special message of his words and life; “a Son” spoke with His Father’s authority, with complete knowledge of His will and purpose. It is impossible to read these first lines (in which the whole argument of the Epistle is enfolded) without recalling the prologue of the fourth Gospel. The name “Word” is not mentioned here, and the highest level of St. John’s teaching is not reached; but the idea which “the Word” expresses, and the thought of the Only Begotten as declaring and interpreting the Father (<a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; also <a href="/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>; <a href="/john/14-24.htm" title="He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.">John 14:24</a>) are present throughout. There is something unusual in the words, “at the end of these days.” St. Peter speaks of the manifestation of Christ “at the end of the times” (<a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1Peter 1:20</a>); and both in the Old Testament and in the New we not unfrequently read “at the end (or, <span class= "ital">in the last</span>) of the days.” (See <a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm" title="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="/jude/1-18.htm" title="How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.">Jude 1:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-14.htm" title="And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-14.htm" title="Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.">Daniel 10:14</a>, &c.) The peculiarity of the expression here lies in “<span class= "ital">these</span> days.” The ages preceding and following the appearance of Messiah are in Jewish writers known as “this world” (or, <span class= "ital">age</span>) and the “coming world” (or, <span class= "ital">age</span>); the “days of Messiah” seem to have been classed sometimes with the former, sometimes with the latter period; but “the end of these days” would be understood by every Jewish reader to denote the time of His appearing.<p><span class= "bld">Whom he hath appointed.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">whom He appointed</span>: in the divine counsels He was constituted “Heir of all things.” The clauses which follow describe the successive steps in the accomplishment of this purpose. The words have often been understood as referring to the Son’s essential Lordship: as Eternal Son He is and must be Heir of all. But this explanation is less consistent with the word “appointed,” with the strict significance of “Heir,” and with the development of the thought in the following verses; and it is on all grounds more probable that in these words is expressed the great theme of the Epistle, the consummation of all things in the Christ.<p><span class= "bld">By whom.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">through whom.</span> So in <a href="/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a> we read that all things came into being through the Word; and in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, “All things have been created through Him.” In this manner Philo repeatedly describes the creative work of the <span class= "ital">Logos.</span> Here, however, “this mediatorial function has entirely changed its character. To the Alexandrian Jew it was the work of a passive tool or instrument; but to the Christian Apostle it represented a co-operating agent” (Lightfoot on <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The worlds.</span>—A word of very common occurrence in the New Testament as a designation of <span class= "ital">time</span> occurs in two passages of this Epistle (here and in <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>) where the context shows more than “age” to be intended. Under time is included the work that is done in time, so that “the ages” here must be (to quote Delitzsch’s words) “the immeasurable content of immeasurable time.” “Also” may seem an unnecessary addition, but (almost in the sense <span class= "ital">accordingly</span>) it points to creation as the first step towards the fulfilment of the design expressed in the preceding clause.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Hath in these last days </span>— Namely, the last of the Jewish Church and state, which were then drawing to their final abolition. Or the times of the Messiah may be intended, as <a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a>. Here we have the second fact of which the apostle proposed to discourse, namely, that the person by whom God hath revealed the gospel is his Son, appearing in the human nature; a person far superior to the highest creatures, even a person properly divine; from which it is reasonable to infer, that the revelation made by him to mankind is more perfect than that made to the Jews by angels, and that the dispensation founded thereon is a better and more permanent dispensation than the law. In saying, <span class="ital">God hath spoken to us, </span>the apostle chiefly intends the members of the Jewish Church. The Jews of those times were very apt to think if they had lived in the days of the former prophets, and had heard them deliver their message from God, they would have received it with cheerful obedience. Their only unhappiness, as they thought, was, that they were born out of due time, as to prophetical revelations, <a href="/matthew/23-30.htm" title="And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.">Matthew 23:30</a>. Now the apostle, aware of this prejudice, informs them that God, in the revelation of the gospel, had spoken to themselves what they so much desired; and that if they did not attend to this word, they must needs be self-condemned. Besides that, the care and love which God had manifested toward them, in speaking to them in this immediate manner, requiring the most indisputable obedience, especially considering how far this mode excelled what he had before used toward their fathers. For this revelation, by the Son of God, is more perfect than any preceding one, because, 1st, It is more <span class="ital">clear, </span>even respecting things formerly revealed; as, for instance, God’s spiritual nature, (<a href="/john/4-24.htm" title="God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.">John 4:24</a>,) and some of his attributes, particularly his love; the fall and depravity of man; his redemption; the person, offices, and work of the Redeemer; the salvation that is through him, particularly as it is future and eternal; that it is attained by faith, the fruits of which, and the spirituality of God’s law, are set in a clearer point of view in the gospel than formerly. 2d, More <span class="ital">full, </span>giving us explicit information of things hardly intimated before, as the abolition of the Jewish dispensation, the temporary rejection of their nation because of their unbelief, a general and solemn judgment; that the consequences of it will be eternal; that the heavens and the earth shall be destroyed, and a new heaven and new earth shall be prepared for the habitation of the righteous. So that whereas the former dispensations might be compared to starlight, or moonshine, this last revelation is called <span class="ital">the day-spring from on high visiting us, </span>(<a href="/context/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,...">Luke 1:78-79</a>,) and <span class="ital">the Sun of righteousness arising upon us: </span>and no wonder, considering that the messenger of this new covenant is the Son of God, to whom God’s will was known not by dreams, visions, voices, &c., or in any of the ways before mentioned, but, as St. John speaks, he was in the bosom of the Father; that is, was intimately and perfectly acquainted with his eternal mind and counsels, being his wisdom, word, and truth, and therefore fully qualified to give mankind a revelation every way perfect and complete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Whom he hath appointed heir of all things </span>— That is, of the whole creation; of all creatures, visible and invisible, which were all made <span class="ital">for him, </span>as well as <span class="ital">by him, </span><a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>. The apostle’s grand design throughout this epistle being to engage the Hebrews to constancy and perseverance in their attachment to the gospel, with its fundamental doctrines, he takes his main argument for that purpose from its immediate author, the promised Messiah, the Son of God. Him, therefore, in this chapter he describes at large, declaring what he is <span class="ital">absolutely, </span>in his person and offices; and <span class="ital">comparatively, </span>with respect to other ministerial revealers of the mind and will of God, principally insisting on his excellence and pre- eminence above angels. After the name of <span class="ital">Son, </span>his inheritance is mentioned. God appointed him the heir long before he made the worlds, <a href="/ephesians/3-11.htm" title="According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:">Ephesians 3:11</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22</a>. Crellius, a noted Socinian, with whom some other Socinians have agreed, allowed that Christ hath the highest dominion and empire over men and angels. But still they would persuade us that all this was spoken of him as a mere man, as the son of Mary. But how a mere man, or mere creature, should have this empire over all men and angels, and all creatures in the universe, or even should know them all, and have power over death, is as impossible to understand as the mystery of the incarnation, or that of the Trinity. But to guard us against this error, the inspired writers have taken care to inform us that he existed before he was born of Mary; before Abraham, <a href="/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>; <span class="ital">before all things, </span><a href="/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>; that he was loved by the Father, and had glory with him <span class="ital">before the foundation of the world, </span><a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>. Nay, and, as the apostle here asserts, that <span class="ital">the worlds were made by him. </span>It is true, the word <span class="greekheb">αιωνας</span>, here used by the apostle, may be rendered <span class="ital">ages, </span>or <span class="ital">dispensations; </span>yet in <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>, it must mean, as it is rendered, <span class="ital">worlds. </span>And we know, from <a href="/context/john/1-2.htm" title="The same was in the beginning with God....">John 1:2-3</a>; <a href="/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/1-10.htm" title="And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:">Hebrews 1:10</a> of this chapter, that the Son of God did in fact make the worlds; and agreeably to the apostle’s words here, (<span class="ital">God hath spoken unto us by his Son, by whom he made the worlds,</span>) in their plain and literal meaning, he was the Son of God when the worlds were made by him. Accordingly, He, <span class="ital">without whom was not any thing made that was made, </span>is called <span class="ital">the only-begotten of the Father, </span><a href="/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....">John 1:1-14</a>, where see the notes. Therefore, <span class="ital">the Son, </span>as the Son, was <span class="ital">before all worlds: </span>and his glory reaches from everlasting to everlasting, though God spake by him to us only <span class="ital">in these last days. </span>This is the third fact of which the apostle proposes to discourse, namely, that the Author of the gospel, in consequence of his having made the worlds, is Heir, or Lord, and Governor of all. And although, after becoming man, he died, yet, being raised from the dead, he had the government of the world restored to him in the human nature. To the faithful, this is a source of the greatest consolation; because if the world is governed by their Master, he certainly hath power to protect and bless them; and every thing befalling them will issue in good to them. Besides, being the Judge as well as the Ruler of the world, he hath authority to acquit them at the judgment, and power to reward them for all the evils they have suffered on his account. This, that the author of the gospel is the Son of God, is the main hinge on which all the apostle’s subsequent arguments throughout the epistle turn, and this bears the stress of all his inferences; and, therefore, having mentioned it, he proceeds immediately to that description of him which gives evidence to all he deduces from this consideration.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-3 God spake to his ancient people at sundry times, through successive generations, and in divers manners, as he thought proper; sometimes by personal directions, sometimes by dreams, sometimes by visions, sometimes by Divine influences on the minds of the prophets. The gospel revelation is excellent above the former; in that it is a revelation which God has made by his Son. In beholding the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ, we behold the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Father, Joh 14:7; the fulness of the Godhead dwells, not typically, or in a figure, but really, in him. When, on the fall of man, the world was breaking to pieces under the wrath and curse of God, the Son of God, undertaking the work of redemption, sustained it by his almighty power and goodness. From the glory of the person and office of Christ, we proceed to the glory of his grace. The glory of His person and nature, gave to his sufferings such merit as was a full satisfaction to the honour of God, who suffered an infinite injury and affront by the sins of men. We never can be thankful enough that God has in so many ways, and with such increasing clearness, spoken to us fallen sinners concerning salvation. That he should by himself cleanse us from our sins is a wonder of love beyond our utmost powers of admiration, gratitude, and praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hath in these last days - In this the final dispensation; or in this dispensation under which the affairs of the world will be wound up. Phrases similar to this occur frequently in the Scriptures. They do not imply that the world was soon coming to an end, but that that was the "last" dispensation, the "last" period of the world. There had been the patriarchal period, the period under the Law, the prophets, etc., and This was the period during which God's "last" method of communication would be enjoyed, and under which the world would close. It might be a very long period, but it would be the "last" one; and so far as the meaning of the phrase is concerned, it might be the longest period, or longer than all the others put together, but still it would be the "last" one. See <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> note; <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> note.<p>Spoken unto us - The word "us" here does not of necessity imply that the writer of the Epistle had actually heard him, or that they had heard him to whom the Epistle was written. It means that God had now communicated his will to man by his Son. It may be said with entire propriety that God has spoken to us by his Son, though we have not personally heard or seen him. We have what he spoke and caused to be recorded for our direction.<p>By his Son - The title commonly given to the Lord Jesus, as denoting his unique relation to God. It was understood by the Jews to denote equality with God (notes, <a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>, <a href="/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>), and is used with such a reference here. See notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, where the meaning of the phrase "Son of God" is fully considered. It is implied here that the fact that the Son of God has spoken to us imposes the highest obligations to attend to what he has said; that he has an authority superior to all those who have spoken in past times; and that there will be special guilt in refusing to attend to what he has spoken. See <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1-4</a>; compare <a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>. The reasons for the superior respect which should be shown to the revelations of the Son of God may be such as these:<p>(1) His rank and dignity. He is the equal with God <a href="//biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>, and is himself called God in this chapter; <a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>. He has a right, therefore, to command, and when he speaks, people should obey.<p>(2) The clearness of the truths which he communicated to man on a great variety of subjects that are of the highest moment to the world. Revelation has been gradual - like the breaking of the day in the east. At first there is a little light; it increases and expands until objects become more and more visible, and then the sun rises in full-orbed glory. At first we discern only the existence of some object - obscure and undefined; then we can trace its outline; then its color, its size, its proportions, its drapery - until it stands before us fully revealed. So it has been with revelation. There is a great variety of subjects which we now see clearly, which were very imperfectly understood by the teaching of the prophets, and would be now if we had only the Old Testament. Among them are the following:<p>(a) The character of God. Christ came to make him known as a merciful being, and to show how he could be merciful as well as just. The views given of God by the Lord Jesus are far more clear than any given by the ancient prophets; compared with those entertained by the ancient philosophers, they are like the sun compared with the darkest midnight,<p>(b) The way in which man may be reconcile to God. The New Testament - which may be considered as what God "has spoken to us by his Son" - has told us how the great work of being reconciled to God can be effected. The Lord Jesus told us that he came to "give his life a ransom for many;" that he laid down his life for his friends; that he was about to die for man; that he would draw all people to him. The prophets indeed - particularly Isaiah - threw much light on these points. But the mass of the people did not understand their revelations. They pertained to future events always difficult to be understood. But Christ has told us the way of salvation, and he has made it so plain that he who runs may read.<p>(c) The moral precepts of the Redeemer are superior to those of any and all that had gone before him. They are elevated, pure, expansive, benevolent - such as became the Son of God to proclaim. Indeed this is admitted on all hands. Infidels are constrained to acknowledge that all the moral precepts of the Saviour are eminently pure and benignant. If they were obeyed, the world would be filled with justice, truth, purity, and benevolence. Error, fraud, hypocrisy, ambition, wars, licentiousness, and intemperance, would cease; and the opposite virtues would diffuse happiness over the face of the world. Prophets had indeed delivered many moral precepts of great importance, but the purest and most extensive body of just principles of good morals on earth are to be found in the teachings of the Saviour.<p>(d) He has given to us the clearest view which man has had of the future state; and he has disclosed in regard to that future state a class of truths of the deepest interest to mankind, which were before wholly unknown or only partially revealed.<p>1. He has revealed the certainty of a state of future existence - in opposition to the Sadducees of all ages. This was denied before he came by multitudes, and where it was not, the arguments by which it was supported were often of the feeblest kind. The "truth" was held by some - like Plato and his followers - but the "arguments" on which they relied were feeble, and such as were untitled to give rest to the soul. The "truth" they had obtained by tradition; the "arguments" were their own.<p>2. He revealed the doctrine of the resurrection of the body. This before was doubted or denied by nearly all the world. It was held to be absurd and impossible. The Saviour taught its certainty; he raised up more than one to show that it was possible; he was himself raised, to put the whole matter beyond debate.<p>3. He revealed the certainty of future judgment - the judgment of all mankind.<p>4. It disclosed great and momentous truths respecting the future state. Before he came, all was dark. The Greeks spoke of Elysian fields, but they were dreams of the imagination; the Hebrews had some faint notion of a future state where all was dark and gloomy, with perhaps an occasional glimpse of the truth that there is a holy and blessed heaven; but to the mass of mind all was obscure. Christ revealed a heaven, and told us of a hell. He showed us that the one might be gained and the other avoided. He presented important motives for doing it; and had he done nothing more, his communications were worthy the profound attention of mankind. I may add:<p>(3) That the Son of God has claims on our attention from the manner in which he spoke. He spoke as one having "authority;" <a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>. He spoke as a "witness" of what he saw and knew; <a href="/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>. He spoke without doubt or ambiguity of God, and heaven, and hell. His is the language of one who is familiar with all that he describes; who saw all, who knew all. There is no hesitancy or doubt in his mind of the truth of what he speaks; and he speaks as if his whole soul were impressed with its unspeakable importance. Never were so momentous communications made to people of hell as fell from the lips of the Lord Jesus (see notes on <a href="/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>); never were announcements made so suited to awe and appall a sinful world.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. in these last days&#8212;In the oldest manuscripts the Greek is. "At the last part of these days." The Rabbins divided the whole of time into "this age," or "world," and "the age to come" (Heb 2:5; 6:5). The days of Messiah were the transition period or "last part of these days" (in contrast to "in times past"), the close of the existing dispensation, and beginning of the final dispensation of which Christ's second coming shall be the crowning consummation.<p>by his Son&#8212;Greek, "IN (His) Son" (Joh 14:10). The true "Prophet" of God. "His majesty is set forth: (1) Absolutely by the very name "Son," and by three glorious predicates, "whom He hath appointed," "by whom He made the worlds," "who sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;" thus His course is described from the beginning of all things till he reached the goal (Heb 1:2, 3). (2) Relatively, in comparison with the angels, Heb 1:4; the confirmation of this follows, and the very name "Son" is proved at Heb 1:5; the "heirship," Heb 1:6-9; the "making the worlds," Heb 1:10-12; the "sitting at the right hand" of God, Heb 1:13, 14." His being made heir follows His sonship, and preceded His making the worlds (Pr 8:22, 23; Eph 3:11). As the first begotten, He is heir of the universe (Heb 1:6), which He made instrumentally, Heb 11:3, where "by the Word of God" answers to "by whom"' (the Son of God) here (Joh 1:3). Christ was "appointed" (in God's eternal counsel) to creation as an office; and the universe so created was assigned to Him as a kingdom. He is "heir of all things" by right of creation, and especially by right of redemption. The promise to Abraham that he should be heir of the world had its fulfilment, and will have it still more fully, in Christ (Ro 4:13; Ga 3:16; 4:7).<p>worlds&#8212;the inferior and the superior worlds (Col 1:16). Literally, "ages" with all things and persons belonging to them; the universe, including all space and ages of time, and all material and spiritual existences.

This is the Gospel revelation, or the revelation in the Gospel dispensation; which though it comes from the same author the other does, yet in many things differs from it, and is preferable to it; and indeed the general design of this epistle is to show the superior excellency of the one to the other; the former was delivered out in time past, but this "in these last days"; the Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, and several other copies, read, "in the last of these days": perfectly agreeable to the phrase , used in <a href="/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a> to which the apostle refers, and in which places the days of the Messiah are intended; and it is a rule with the Jews (m), that wherever the phrase, "the last days", is mentioned, the days of the Messiah are designed: and they are to be understood not of the last days of the natural world, but of, the Jewish world and state; indeed the times of the Messiah, or Gospel dispensation, may be called the last days of the natural world, according to the tradition of the house of Elias; which teaches, that the duration of the world will be six thousand years, and divides it into three parts, the last of which is assigned to the Messiah, thus; two thousand years void, (or without the law,) two thousand years the law, and two thousand years the days of the Messiah (n): but it is best to understand this of the last days of the Mosaic economy, or Jewish dispensation; for the Messiah was to come before the Jewish civil and church states were dissolved; before the sceptre departed from Judah, and before the second temple was destroyed; and he was to come at the end, or toward the close of both these states; and which is called the end, or ends of the world, <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> and quickly after Jesus, the true Messiah was come, an end was put to both these: from whence it may be observed, that the Messiah must be come; that the Mosaic economy, and Jewish worship, will never be restored again; that the Gospel revelation being made in the last days, ought to be regarded the more, it being the last revelation God will ever make. Moreover, this differs from the former in this respect, that was made to the fathers, this "to us"; meaning either the apostles in particular, or the Jews in general, to whom the apostle is writing: this shows that the Gospel revelation was first made to the Jews; and it being made to them personally, they were under great obligation to regard it; and that God had not cast off his people; and that though he had greatly indulged their fathers, he had showed greater favour to them, having provided some better thing for them: and there is a difference between these two revelations in the manner in which they were made; the former was at sundry times, and in divers manners, the latter was made at once, and in one way; that was delivered out in parts, and by piece meal, this the whole together; the whole mind and will of God, all his counsel, all that Christ heard of the Father; it is the faith that was once, and at once, delivered to the saints; and it has been given out in one way, by the preaching of the word: to which may be added, that formerly God spoke by many persons, by the prophets, but now by one only, "by his Son"; who is so not by creation, nor by adoption, nor by office, but by nature; being his own Son, his proper Son, begotten of him, of the same nature with him, and equal to him; and so infinitely preferable to the prophets: he is a Son, and not a servant, in whom the Father is, and he in the Father, and in whom the Spirit is without measure; and God is said to speak by him, or in him, because he was now incarnate; and what he says from God should be attended to, both on account of the dignity of his person, as the Son of God, and because of the authority he came with as Mediator: whom he hath appointed heir of all things; which must be understood of him not as God, and Creator; for as such he has a right to all things; all that the Father has are his; the kingdom of nature and providence belongs to him, he being the Former and Maker of all things; but as Mediator, who has all things committed to him, to subserve the ends of his office; and has a kingdom appointed him, and which he will deliver up again the word all may refer either to persons or things; to persons, not angels, good or bad, though both are subject to him, yet neither are called his inheritance; but elect men, who are his portion, and the lot of his inheritance; and to things relating to these persons, and for their use and service, in time, and to all eternity; as all temporal things, and all spiritual ones, the blessings and promises of the covenant of grace, the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and eternal glory and happiness, the saints' inheritance, who are joint heirs with Christ. <p>By whom also he made the worlds; this is said in agreement with the notions of the Jews, and their way of speaking, who make mention of three worlds, which they call, the upper world (the habitation of God), the middle world (the air), and the lower world (o) (the earth); and sometimes they call them the world of angels (where they dwell), the world of orbs (where the sun, moon, and stars are), and the world below (p) (on which we live); and it is frequent in their writings, and prayer books (q), to call God  , "Lord of all worlds"; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, these God made by his Son, not as an instrument, but as an efficient cause with him; for by him were all things made, whether visible or invisible; and the preposition "by" does not always denote instrumentality, but sometimes efficiency; and is used of God the Father himself, and in this epistle, <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>. <p>(m) Kimchi &amp; Aben Ezra in Isa. ii. 2.((n) T.

But however delicate and acute this conception of the subject, it is too greatly refined and artificial. In point of simplicity and naturalness it falls short of the view that at vv. 2, 3 the various phases of the life of Christ are described in their historic succession, so that only in connection with the intermediate member<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὢν</span> … <span class="greekheb">φέρων τε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., ver. 3 (<span class="ital">see on the verse</span>)—there resounds throughout, in addition to the main reference to an earlier condition of the life of Christ, at the same time the subordinate reference to a later condition of His life. That which Riehm urges in support of his own view, and in refutation of the opposite one, is easily disposed of. When he thinks, in the first place, that only by his apprehension the whole structure of the period becomes thoroughly clear, this is already shown to be inaccurate by the fact that the simple is always more clear than the complex. For even if it be admitted in some respects that a new division of thought begins with the <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span>, ver. 3, which specially brings into relief the subject, whereas before <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεός</span> was the subject, yet nothing is to be inferred from this, because the character of the relative statements, ver. 2, is not changed thereby, inasmuch as the reference to God assuredly appears in the third relative clause, namely, in <span class="greekheb">κεκληρονόμηκεν</span>, ver. 4. When Riehm further contends that in his explanation ver. 2 agrees much better with that which precedes,—inasmuch as by the <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span>, ver. 1, the historic Christ is confessedly to be understood, but now an inexplicable leap in the thought would arise, if the author had first ascribed to the historic Christ a number of predicates, which were appropriate to Him only as the premundane Logos, and should only afterwards speak of His present glory,—this contention is already sufficiently refuted by the wholly parallel procedure of the Apostle Paul, <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm" title="Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:">Php 2:5</a> ff., who likewise takes his departure from the historic Christ, and then, in the same order which Riehm calls an “inexplicable leap in the thought,” attaches thereto further statements with regard to the person of the Redeemer. Moreover, in our passage the order of succession censured as an “inexplicable leap in the thought” is perfectly justified, because <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span>, ver. 1, is the total expression, which, as such, includes in itself all the stadia in the life of Christ; and thus from it one might proceed with equal justice immediately to the premundane Christ as to the exalted Christ. If Riehm further supposes that in connection with the appointment as heir, ver. 2, we cannot think of a destination made in the eternal decree of God, then the analogous declaration of Scripture: <span class="greekheb">πατέρα πολλῶν ἐθνῶν τέθεικά σε</span>, <a href="/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>, already proves the opposite; and if he finds the expression <span class="greekheb">κληρονόμος</span> appropriate only to the incarnate Son, inasmuch as the name could hardly otherwise occur in connection with <span class="greekheb">τιθέναι</span> than in reference to a possession which the <span class="greekheb">κληρονόμος</span> once had not, there underlies this objection only this amount of truth, namely, that the expression <span class="greekheb">κληρονόμος</span> no doubt includes in itself a reference pointing to the future; but that which it is designed to express by the first relative clause is assuredly also only the thought that Christ was in the ideal sense before all time appointed or made something, which in the real sense He could only be in the full extent at the end of all time. When, finally, Riehm believes that <span class="greekheb">ὃν ἔθηκεν κληρονόμον πάντων</span>, ver. 2, must be understood of the dominion of the exalted Christ, for the reason that the passage <a href="/context/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom....">Hebrews 1:8-9</a>, bearing upon the dominion of the exalted Christ, is supposed to refer back to those words, this is altogether erroneous, since a special referring back on the part of <a href="/context/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom....">Hebrews 1:8-9</a> to the opening proposition of ver. 2 is not by any means to be admitted.

This <span class="ital">aoristic</span> mode of speaking of God’s dealings, and of the Christian life, as <span class="ital">single acts</span>, is common throughout the New Testament, and especially in St Paul, and conveys the thought that<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Are, and were, and will be are but <span class="ital">is</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And all creation is one act at once.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word “spoke” is here used in its fullest and deepest meaning of Him whose very name is “the Word of God.” It is true that this author, unlike St John, does not actually apply the Alexandrian term “Logos” (“Word”) to Christ, but it always seems to be in his thoughts, and, so to speak, to be trembling on his lips. The essential and ideal Unity which dominated over the “many parts” and “many modes” of the older revelation is implied in the most striking way by the fact that it was the same God who spake to the Fathers in the Prophets and to us in a Son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span> these last days<span class="bld"></span></span>] The better reading (<span class="greekheb">א</span>, A, B, D, E, &c.) is “at the end of these days.” The phrase represents the technical Hebrew expression <span class="ital">be-acharîth ha-yâmîm</span> (<a href="/numbers/24-14.htm" title="And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.">Numbers 24:14</a>). The Jews divided the religious history of the world into “<span class="ital">this age</span>” (<span class="ital">Olam hazzeh</span>) and “the future age” (<span class="ital">Olam habba</span>). The “future age” was the one which was to begin at the coming of the Messiah, whose days were spoken of by the Rabbis as “the last days.” But, as Christians believed that the Messiah had now come, to them the former period had ended. They were practically living in the age to which their Jewish contemporaries alluded as the “age to come” (<a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a>, <a href="/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>). They spoke of this epoch as “the fulness of the times” (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>); “the last days” (<a href="/james/5-3.htm" title="Your gold and silver is corroded; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. You have heaped treasure together for the last days.">James 5:3</a>); “the last hour” (<a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>); “the crisis of rectification” (<a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a>); “the close of the ages” (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>). And yet, even to Christians, there was <span class="ital">one</span> aspect in which the new Messianic dispensation was still to be followed by “a future age,” because the kingdom of God had not yet come either completely or in its final development, which depended on the Second Advent. Hence “the last crisis,” “the later crises” (<a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>) are still in the future, though they thought that it would be a near future; after which would follow the “rest,” the “Sabbatism” (<a href="/hebrews/4-4.htm" title="For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.">Hebrews 4:4</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/4-10.htm" title="For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his....">Hebrews 4:10-11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>) which still awaits the people of God. The indistinctness of separation between “this age” and “the future age” arises from different views as to the period in which the actual “days of the Messiah” are to be reckoned. The Rabbis also sometimes include them in the former, sometimes in the latter. But the writer regarded the end as being at hand (<a href="/hebrews/10-13.htm" title="From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.">Hebrews 10:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm" title="Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.">Hebrews 10:25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm" title="For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.">Hebrews 10:37</a>). He felt that the former dispensation was annulled and outworn, and anticipated rightly that it could not have many years to run.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by his Son</span>] Rather, “in a <span class="bld">Son</span>.” The contrast is here the <span class="ital">Relation</span> rather than the <span class="ital">Person</span> of Christ, “in Him who was <span class="bld">a Son</span>.” The preposition “<span class="ital">in</span>” is here most applicable in its strict meaning, because “in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” “The Father, <span class="ital">that dwelleth in me</span>, He doeth the works” (<a href="/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>). The contrast of the New and Old is expressed by St John (<a href="/john/1-17.htm" title="For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.">John 1:17</a>), “The Law was given by Moses, but <span class="ital">grace and truth</span> came by Jesus Christ.” In Christ all the fragments of previous revelation were completed; all the methods of it concentrated; and all its apparent perplexities and contradictions solved and rendered intelligible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he hath appointed</span>] Rather, “He appointed.” The question as to the <span class="ital">special</span> act of God thus alluded to, is hardly applicable. Our temporal expressions may involve an inherent absurdity when applied to. Him whose life is the timeless Now of Eternity and in Whom there is neither before nor after, nor variableness, nor shadow cast by turning, but Who is always in the Meridian of an unconditioned Plenitude (<span class="ital">Pleroma</span>). See <a href="/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">James 1:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">heir of all things</span>] Sonship naturally suggests heirship (<a href="/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>) and in Christ was fulfilled the immense promise to Abraham that his seed should be heir of the world. The allusion, so far as we can enter into these high mysteries of Godhead, is to Christ’s mediatorial kingdom. We only darken counsel by the multitude of words without knowledge when we attempt to define and explain the relations of the Persons of the Trinity towards each other. The doctrine of the <span class="greekheb">περιχώρησις</span>, <span class="ital">circuminsessio</span> or <span class="ital">communicatio idiomatum</span> as it was technically called—that is the relation of Divinity and Humanity as effected within the Divine Nature itself by the Incarnation—is wholly beyond the limit of our comprehension. We may in part see this from the fact that the Son Himself is (in <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>) represented as doing what in this verse the Father does. But that the <span class="ital">Mediatorial</span> Kingdom is given to the Son by the Father is distinctly stated in <a href="/john/3-35.htm" title="The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.">John 3:35</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18</a> (comp. <a href="/context/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?...">Hebrews 2:6-8</a> and <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm" title="Ask of me, and I shall give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.">Psalm 2:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by whom</span>] i.e. “by whose means;” “by whom, as His agent.” Comp. “All things were made by Him” (i.e. by the Word) (<a href="/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>). “By Him were all things created” (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>). “By Whom are all things” (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>). What the Alexandrian theosophy attributed to the Logos, had been attributed to “Wisdom” (see <a href="/context/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old....">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>) in what was called the <span class="ital">Chokhmah</span> or the Sapiential literature of the Jews.

Over that imaginary chasm St John had thrown the one wide arch of the Incarnation when he wrote “the Word became flesh.” In the N.T. the word “aeons” never has this Gnostic meaning. In the singular the word means “an age;” in the plural it sometimes means “ages” like the Hebrew <span class="ital">olamim</span>.

For allusions elsewhere to the two periods, cf. <a href="/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a>; <a href="/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>; <a href="/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>.

Alex. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. A subject of discussion has been the point of division between the two ages - whether the commencement of the Christian dispensation, ushered in by the exaltation of Christ, or his second advent. The conception in the Jewish mind, founded on Messianic prophecy, would, of course, be undefined. It would only be that the coming of the Messiah would inaugurate a new order of things. But how did the New Testament writers after Christ's ascension conceive the two ages? Did they regard themselves as living at the end of the former age or at the beginning of the new one? The passage before us does not help to settle the question, nor does <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; for the reference in both cases is to the historical manifestation of Christ before his ascension. But others of the passages cited above seem certainly to imply that "the coming age" was regarded as still future. It has been said, indeed, with regard to this apparent inference from some of them, that the writers were regarding their own age from the old Jewish standing-point when they spoke of it as future, or only used well-known phrases to denote the two ages, though they were no longer strictly applicable (see Alford's note on Hebrews 2:5). But this explanation cannot well be made to apply to such passages as <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, or to those in the Gospels. It would appear from them that it was not till the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (or, as it is designated in the pastoral Epistles, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) of Christ that "the coming age" of prophecy was regarded as destined to begin, ushering in "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). Still, though "that day" was in the future, the first coming of Christ had been, as it were, its dawn, signifying its approach and preparing believers for meeting it. "The darkness was passing away; the true light was already shining" (<a href="/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a>). Hence the apostolic writers sometimes speak as if already in the "coming age;" as being already citizens of heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>); as already "made to sit with Christ in the heavenly places" (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>); having already "tasted the powers of the age to come" (<a href="/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>). In a certain sense they felt themselves in the new order of things, though, strictly speaking, they still regarded their own age as but the end of the old one, irradiated by the light of the new. To understand fully their language on the subject, we should remember that they supposed the second advent to be more imminent than it was. St. Paul, at one time certainly, thought that it might be before his own death (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). Thus they might naturally speak of their own time as the conclusion of the former age, though regarding the second advent as the commencement of the new one. But the prolongation of "the end of these days," unforeseen by them, does not affect the essence of their teaching on the subject. In the Divine counsels "one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." <span class="cmt_word">Hath spoken unto us</span> (more properly, <span class="accented">spake to us</span>) in his Son. "His" is here properly supplied to give the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span>. The rendering, a SON, which seems to have the advantage of literalism, would be misleading if it suggested the idea of one among many sons, or a son in the same sense in which others are sons. For though the designation, "son of God," is undoubtedly used in subordinate senses - applied <span class="accented">e.g.</span> to Adam, to angels, to good men, to Christians - yet what follows in the Epistle fixes its peculiar meaning here. The entire drift of the earlier part of the Epistle is to show that the idea involved in the word "Son," as applied to the Messiah in prophecy, is that of a relation to God far above that of the angels or of Moses, and altogether unique in its character. This idea must have been in the writer's mind when he selected the phrases of his exordium. Nor is the article required for the sense intended. Its omission, in fact, brings it out. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> would have drawn especial attention to "the <span class="accented">personage</span> in whom God spake; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> does so rather to the <span class="accented">mode</span> of the speaking - it is equivalent to "in one who was SON." Son-revelation (as afterwards explained), is contrasted with previous prophetic revelations (cf. for omission of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whom he appointed</span> (or, <span class="accented">constituted</span>) heir of all things; not, as in the A.V., "hath appointed." The verb is in the aorist, and here the indefinite sense of the aorist should be preserved. "<span class="accented">Convenienter</span> statim sub Filii nomen memoratur haereditas" (Bengel). Two questions arise. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Was it in respect of his eternal Divinity, or of his manifestation in time, that the Son was appointed "Heir of all things?" <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When is God to be conceived as so appointing him? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What is the time, if any, to be assigned to the indefinite aorist? In answer to question <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the second alternative is to be preferred. For <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> his eternal pre-existence has not yet been touched upon: it is introduced, as it were parenthetically, in the next and following clauses. <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Though the term Son is legitimately used in theology to denote the eternal relation to the Father expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of St. John, yet its application in this Epistle and in the New Testament generally (excepting, perhaps, the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> peculiar to St. John, on which see Bull, 'Jud. Eccl. Cath.,' 5:4, etc.), is to the Word made flesh, to the Son as manifested in the Christ. And hence it is to him as such that we may conclude the heirship to be here assigned. <p><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> This is the view carried out in the sequel of the Epistle, where the SON is represented as attaining the universal dominion assigned to him after, and in consequence of, his human obedience. The conclusion of the exordium in itself expresses this; for it is not till after he had made purification of sins that he is said to have "sat down," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entered on his inheritance; having become (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>) "<span class="accented">so</span> much better," etc. This is the view of Chrysostom, Theodoret, and the Fathers generally (cf. the cognate passage, <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It seems best to refer the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, not to any definite time, as that of the prophetic utterances afterwards cited, or that of the actual exaltation of Christ, but indefinitely to the eternal counsels, which were indeed declared and fulfilled in time, but were themselves <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span>. A similar use of the aorist, coupled with other aorists pointing to events in time, is found in <a href="//niv.scripturetext.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29, 30</a>. What this heirship of all things implies will appear in the sequel, <span class="cmt_word">By whom also he made the worlds</span>. Interposed clause to complete the true conception of the SON; showing who and what he was originally and essentially through whom God "spake" in time, and who, as SON, inherited. Here certainly, and in the expressions which follow, we have the same doctrine as that of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of St. John. And the testimony of the New Testament to the pre-existence and deity of Christ is the more striking from our finding the same essential idea under different forms of expression, and in writings differing so much from each other in character and style. He who appeared in the world as Christ is, in the first place, here said (as by St. <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) to have been the Agent of creation; cf. <a href="//niv.scripturetext.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-17</a>, where the original creative agency of "the Son of his love" is emphatically set forth, as well as his being "the Head of the body, the Church." This cognate passage is of weight against the view of interpreters who would take the one before us as referring to the initiation of the gospel ages; with respect to which view see also the quotation from Bull given below under ver. 3. Here <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to "the worlds," as in the A.V. For though the primary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> has reference to <span class="accented">time</span> - limited in periods, or unlimited in eternity - it is used to denote also the whole system of things called into being by the Creator in time and through which alone we are able to conceive time.

The second he describes as &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; the season of reformation (<a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>), which is &#x3bf;&#787; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; the season to come: comp. &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; the world to come (<a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>); &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; the age to come (<a href="/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>); &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; the city to come (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>). The first period is the period of the old covenant; the second that of the new covenant. The second period does not begin with Christ's first appearing. His appearing and public ministry are at the end of the first period but still within it. The dividing-point between the two periods is the &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; the consummation of the age, mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>. This does not mean the same thing as at the last of these days (<a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), which is the end of the first period denoted by these days, but the conclusion of the first and the beginning of the second period, at which Christ appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. This is the end of the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; the present season: this is the limit of the validity of the old sacrificial offerings: this is the inauguration of the time of reformation.

Attention is directed, not to Christ's divine personality, but to his filial relation. While the former revelation was given through a definite class, the prophets, the new revelation is given through one who is a son as distinguished from a prophet. He belongs to another category. The revelation was a son-revelation. See <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10-18</a>. Christ's high priesthood is the central fact of the epistle, and his sonship is bound up with his priesthood. See <a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5</a>. For a similar use of &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; son without the article, applied to Christ, see <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>.<p>Whom he hath appointed heir of all things (&#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>For &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; appointed, see on <a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>.

God eternally predestined the Son to be the possessor and sovereign of all things. Comp. <a href="/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28</a>. Heirship goes with sonship. See <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>. Christ attained the messianic lordship through incarnation. Something was acquired as the result of his incarnation which he did not possess before it, and could not have possessed without it. Equality with God was his birthright, but out of his human life, death, and resurrection came a type of sovereignty which could pertain to him only through his triumph over human sin in the flesh (see <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), through his identification with men as their brother. Messianic lordship could not pertain to his preincarnate state: it is a matter of function, not of inherent power and majesty. He was essentially Son of God; he must become Son of man.<p>By whom also he made the worlds (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;' &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; commonly expresses secondary agency, but, in some instances, it is used of God's direct agency. See <a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>. Christ is here represented as a mediate agency in creation. The phrase is, clearly, colored by the Alexandrian conception, but differs from it in that Christ is not represented as a mere instrument, a passive tool, but rather as a cooperating agent. "Every being, to reach existence, must have passed through the thought and will of the Logos" (Godet); yet "the Son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the Father doing" (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>). With this passage <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> should be studied. There it is said that all things, collectively (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;), were created in him (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;) and through him (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;' &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; as here). The former expression enlarges and completes the latter. &#x394;&#x3b9;' &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; represents Christ as the mediate instrument. &#x395;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; indicates that "all the laws and purposes which guide the creation and government of the universe reside in him, the Eternal Word, as their meeting-point." Comp. <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>. For &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; the worlds, see additional note on <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. Rend. for by whom also he made, by whom he also made. The emphasis is on made, not on worlds: on the fact of creation, not on what was created. In the writer's thought heirship goes with creation. Christ is heir of what he made, and because he made it. As &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, in the preceding clause, regards all things taken singly, &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; regards them in cycles. &#x391;&#787;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; does not mean times, as if representing the Son as the creator of all time and times, but creation unfolded in time through successive aeons. All that, in successive periods of time, has come to pass, has come to pass through him.
