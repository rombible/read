The passage which follows is taken from <a href="/context/psalms/45-6.htm" title="Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of your kingdom is a right scepter.">Psalm 45:6-7</a>. As the words stand in the ordinary Greek text, they agree exactly with the LXX.; but certain alterations of reading are required by the best evidence. After the words “for ever and ever” <span class= "ital">and</span> must be restored, and in the following clause <span class= "ital">the</span> and <span class= "ital">a</span> must change places. The latter change is of moment only as it affects the former. Were the words in all other respects cited with perfect exactness, the introduction of <span class= "ital">and</span> would probably indicate that the writer intended to split up the quotation into two parts, each significant for his purpose. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/2-13.htm" title="And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.">Hebrews 2:13</a>.) As, however, we note other minor changes, the insertion of the connecting word is probably accidental. A third reading is of much greater importance. At the close of the verse the two oldest of our Greek MSS. agree in reading “His kingdom:” to this we will return afterwards.<p>We have every reason to believe that the application of Psalms 45 which is here made was fully received by the ancient Jews; thus in the Targum on the Psalm <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a> is taken as a direct address to the King Messiah. Hence the readers of this Epistle would at once recognise the argument which the words contain. It is strongly maintained by some that the Psalm (like Psalms 110, see below, on <a href="/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>) is altogether prophetic, the promised Messiah <span class= "ital">alone</span> being in the Psalmist’s thought. There appear to be insuperable objections to this view, from particular expressions used (in the later verses especially), and from the general structure and colouring of the Psalm. It is in every way more probable that the second Psalm (see Note on <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>), rather than Psalms 110, represents the class to which Psalms 45 belongs. Originally writing in celebration of the marriage of a king of David’s line (we know not whom, but many of the arguments urged against the possible reference to Solomon have no great weight), the inspired Psalmist uses words which bear their full meaning only when applied to that Son of David of whose kingdom there shall be no end. The promises made to David (2 Samuel 7) are before <span class= "ital">the</span> writer’s mind in the first verses of the Psalm. The king appointed by God is His representative to God’s people; his cause is that of truth and righteousness; his dominion will continually advance. It is at this moment that, with the promise of a divine sonship (Psalms 2) in his thought, he suddenly addresses the sing as Elohim (<a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>), a divine king who receives from God the reward of righteousness (<a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.">Hebrews 1:8</a>). There are in the Old Testament examples of the use of Elohim which diminish the difficulty of its application to an earthly king (such as <a href="/psalms/82-1.htm" title="God stands in the congregation of the mighty; he judges among the gods.">Psalm 82:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm" title="For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.">Psalm 95:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-13.htm" title="And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.">1Samuel 28:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.">Exodus 7:1</a>); but it must still be acknowledged that the passage stands alone. This difficulty, however, relates only to the primary application. As the higher and true reference of the words became revealed, all earthly limitations disappeared; the Christian readers of the Psalm recognised in the Messiah of whom it speaks a King who is God.<p>The reading “His kingdom” has seemed to require a different rendering of the words in the first part of the verse: <span class= "ital">God is Thy throne for ever and ever. </span>This rendering, however, will suit either reading of the Greek, and is equally admissible as a rendering of the Hebrew. Nor is it really inconsistent with the position in which the verse here stands: in contrast with the ministry of angels is set, on this view, not indeed a direct address to the Son as God, but the sovereign rule which the Son receives from God. The objections raised against it are: (1) such an expression as “God is Thy throne” is contrary to the analogy of Scripture language; (2) the ordinary rendering has the support of almost all ancient authority, Jewish writers and ancient versions being apparently united in its favour. The former argument is not very strong in face of <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>, and similar passages; but the latter is so weighty that we hesitate to accept the change, helpful as it would be in making clear the original and typical reference of <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a>. It should be said that the reading “His kingdom” is not inconsistent with the ordinary translation of the preceding words; for a sudden transition from “<span class= "ital">Thy</span> throne, O God” to <span class= "ital">“His</span> kingdom” is in full accordance with the usage of Hebrew poetry. (See <a href="/psalms/43-4.htm" title="Then will I go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy: yes, on the harp will I praise you, O God my God.">Psalm 43:4</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/67-5.htm" title="Let the people praise you, O God; let all the people praise you.">Psalm 67:5-6</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4-6</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) There are other renderings which would require discussion if we were concerned with the Hebrew text of the Psalm: the two given above are the only possible translations of the Greek.<p><span class= "bld">A sceptre . . .</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the sceptre of uprightness is a sceptre of Thy</span> (or, <span class= "ital">His</span>)<span class= "ital"> kingdom.</span> Righteousness itself (so to speak, the very ideal of righteous government) bears sway in Thy kingdom.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:4-14 Many Jews had a superstitious or idolatrous respect for angels, because they had received the law and other tidings of the Divine will by their ministry. They looked upon them as mediators between God and men, and some went so far as to pay them a kind of religious homage or worship. Thus it was necessary that the apostle should insist, not only on Christ's being the Creator of all things, and therefore of angels themselves, but as being the risen and exalted Messiah in human nature, to whom angels, authorities, and powers are made subject. To prove this, several passages are brought from the Old Testament. On comparing what God there says of the angels, with what he says to Christ, the inferiority of the angels to Christ plainly appears. Here is the office of the angels; they are God's ministers or servants, to do his pleasure. But, how much greater things are said of Christ by the Father! And let us own and honour him as God; for if he had not been God, he had never done the Mediator's work, and had never worn the Mediator's crown. It is declared how Christ was qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he was confirmed in it: he has the name Messiah from his being anointed. Only as Man he has his fellows, and as anointed with the Holy Spirit; but he is above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were employed in the service of God on earth. Another passage of Scripture, Ps 102:25-27, is recited, in which the Almighty power of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared, both in creating the world and in changing it. Christ will fold up this world as a garment, not to be abused any longer, not to be used as it has been. As a sovereign, when his garments of state are folded and put away, is a sovereign still, so our Lord, when he has laid aside the earth and heavens like a vesture, shall be still the same. Let us not then set our hearts upon that which is not what we take it to be, and will not be what it now is. Sin has made a great change in the world for the worse, and Christ will make a great change in it for the better. Let the thoughts of this make us watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better world. The Saviour has done much to make all men his friends, yet he has enemies. But they shall be made his footstool, by humble submission, or by utter destruction. Christ shall go on conquering and to conquer. The most exalted angels are but ministering spirits, mere servants of Christ, to execute his commands. The saints, at present, are heirs, not yet come into possession. The angels minister to them in opposing the malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their bodies, instructing and comforting their souls, under Christ and the Holy Ghost. Angels shall gather all the saints together at the last day, when all whose hearts and hopes are set upon perishing treasures and fading glories, will be driven from Christ's presence into everlasting misery.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But unto the Son he saith - In <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6-7</a>. The fact that the writer of this Epistle makes this application of the Psalm to the Messiah, proves that it was so applied in his time, or that it would be readily admitted to be applicable to him. It has been generally admitted, by both Jewish and Christian interpreters, to have such a reference. Even those who have doubted its primary applicability to the Messiah, have regarded it as referring to him in a secondary sense. Many have supposed that it referred to Solomon in the primary sense, and that it has a secondary reference to the Messiah. To me it seems most probable that it had an original and exclusive reference to the Messiah. It is to be remembered that the hope of the Messiah was the special hope of the Jewish people. The coming of the future king, so early promised, was the great event to which they all looked forward with the deepest interest.<p>That hope inspired their prophets and their bards, and cheered the hearts of the nation in the time of despondency. The Messiah, if I may so express it, was the "hero" of the Old Testament - more so than Achilles is of the Iliad, and Aeneas of the Aenead. The sacred poets were accustomed to employ all their most magnificent imagery in describing him, and to present him in every form that was beautiful in their conception, and that would be gratifying to the pride and hopes of the nation. Everything that is gorgeous and splendid in description is lavished on him, and they were never under any apprehension of attributing to him too great magnificence in his personal reign; too great beauty of moral character; or too great an extent of dominion. That which would be regarded by them as a magnificent description of a monarch, they freely applied to him; and this is evidently the case in this Psalm. That the description may have been in part derived from the view of Solomon in the magnificence of his court, is possible, but no more probable than that it was derived from the general view of the splendor of any Oriental monarch, or than that it might have been the description of a monarch which was the pure creation of inspired poetry.<p>Indeed, I do see not why this Psalm should ever have been supposed to be applicable to Solomon. His "name" is not mentioned. It has no special applicability to him. There is nothing that would apply to him which would not also apply to many an Oriental prince. There are some things in it which are much less applicable to him than to many others. The king here described is a conqueror. He girds his sword on his thigh, and his arrows are sharp in the hearts of his foes, and the people are subdued under him. This was not true of Solomon. His was a reign of peace and tranquillity, nor was he ever distinguished for war. On the whole, it seems clear to me, that this Psalm is designed to be a beautiful poetic description of the Messiah as king. The images are drawn from the usual characteristics of an Oriental prince, and there are many things in the poem - as there are in parables - for the sake of keeping, or verisimilitude, and which are not, in the interpretation, to be cut to the quick.<p>The writer imagined to himself a magnificent and beautiful prince; a prince riding prosperously in his conquests; swaying a permanent and wide dominion; clothed in rich and splendid vestments; eminently upright and pure; and scattering blessings everywhere - and that prince was the Messiah. The Psalm, therefore, I regard as relating originally and exclusively to Christ; and though in the interpretation, the circumstances should not be unduly pressed, nor an attempt be made to spiritualize them, yet the whole is a glowing and most beautiful description of Christ as a King. The same principles of interpretation should be applied to it which are applied to parables, and the same allowance be made for the introduction of circumstances for the sake of keeping, or for finishing the story. If this be the correct view, then Paul has quoted the Psalm in conformity exactly with its original intention, as he undoubtedly quoted it as it was understood in his time.<p>"Thy throne." A throne is the seat on which a monarch sits, and is here the symbol of dominion, because kings when acting as rulers sit on thrones. Thus, a throne becomes the emblem of authority or empire. Here it means, that his "rule" or "dominion" would be perpetual - "forever and ever" - which assuredly could not be applied to Solomon. "O God." This certainly could not be applied to Solomon; but applied to the Messiah it proves what the apostle is aiming to prove - that he is above the angels. The argument is, that a name is given to "him" which is never given to "them." They are not called "God" in any strict and proper sense. The "argument" here requires us to understand this word, as used in a sense more exalted than any name which is ever given to angels, and though it may be maintained that the name &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'elohiym, is given to magistrates or to angels, yet here the argument requires us to understand it as used in a sense superior to what it ever is when applied to an angel - or of course to any creature, since it was the express design of the argument to prove that the Messiah was superior to the angels.<p>The word "God" should be taken in its natural and obvious sense, unless there is some necessary reason for limiting it. If applied to magistrates <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>, it must be so limited. If applied to the Messiah, there is no such necessity, <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>, and it should be taken in its natural and proper sense. The "form" here - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  ho Theos - is in the vocative case and not the nominative. It is the usual form of the vocative in the Septuagint, and nearly the only form of it - Stuart. This then is a direct address to the Messiah, calling him God; and I see not why it is not to be used in the usual and proper sense of the word. Unitarians proposed to translate this, "God is thy throne;" but how can God be "a throne" of a creature? What is the meaning of such an expression? Where is there one parallel? And what must be the nature of that cause which renders such an argument necessary? - This refers, as it seems to me, to the Messiah "as king."<p>It does not relate to his mode of existence before the incarnation, but to him as the magnificent monarch of his people. Still, the ground or reason why this name is given to him is that he is "divine." It is language which properly expresses his nature. He must have a divine nature, or such language would be improper. I regard this passage, therefore, as full proof that the Lord Jesus is divine; nor is it possible to evade this conclusion by any fair interpretation of it. It cannot be wrong to address him as God; nor addressing him as such, not to regard him as divine. "Is forever and ever." This could not in any proper sense apply to Solomon. As applied to the Messiah, it means that his essential kingdom will be perpetual, <a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>. As Mediator his kingdom will be given up to the Father, or to God without reference to a mediatorial work, (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-28.htm">1 Corinthians 15:28</a> - see notes on these verses), but his reign over his people will be perpetual.<p>There never will come a time when they shall not obey and serve him, though the special form of his kingdom, as connected with the work of mediation, will be changed. The form of the organized church, for example, will be changed, for there shall be no necessity for it in heaven, but the essential dominion and power of the Son of God will not cease. He shall have the same dominion which he had before he entered on the work of mediation; and that will be eternal. It is also true that, compared with earthly monarchs, his kingdom shall be perpetual. They soon die. Dynasties pass away. But his empire extends from age to age, and is properly a perpetual dominion. The fair and obvious interpretation of this passage would satisfy me, were there nothing else, that this Psalm had no reference to Solomon, but was designed originally as a description of the Messiah as the expected King and Prince of his people. "A scepter of righteousness."<p>That is, a right or just scepter. The phrase is a Hebraism. The former expression described the perpetuity of his kingdom; this describes its "equable nature." It would be just and equal; see notes on <a href="/isaiah/11-5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>. A "scepter" is a staff or wand usually made of wood, five or six feet long, and commonly overlaid with gold, or ornamented with golden rings. Sometimes, however, the scepter was made of ivory, or wholly of gold. It was borne in the hands of kings as an emblem of authority and power. Probably it had its origin in the staff or crook of the shepherd - as kings were at first regarded as the "shepherds" of their people. Thus, Agamemnon is commonly called by Homer the "shepherd" of the people. The "scepter" thus becomes the emblem of kingly office and power - as when we speak of "swaying a scepter;" - and the idea here is, that the Messiah would be a "king," and that the authority which he would wield would be equitable and just. He would not be governed, as monarchs often are, by mere caprice, or by the wishes of courtiers and flatterers; he would not be controlled by mere "will" and the love of arbitrary lower; but the execution of his laws would be in accordance with the principles of equity and justice. - How well this accords with the character of the Lord Jesus we need not pause to show; compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

What he does not to angels, and which sets him infinitely above them; which shows him to be a Prince and King, and not a servant, or minister; and which even ascribes deity to him: <p>thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: this, with what follows in this verse, and the next, is taken out of <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a> which psalm is not spoken of Solomon, to whom many things in it will not agree; he was not fairer than other men; nor was he a warrior; nor was his throne for ever and ever; and much less a divine person, and the object of worship; but the Messiah, and so the ancient Jews understand it: the Targum applies it to him, and mentions him by name in <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a> and some of their modern writers (z) affirm it is said of the Messiah; though Aben Ezra seems doubtful about it, saying, it is spoken concerning David, or Messiah his Son, whose name is so, <a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>. Deity is here ascribed to the Son of God; he is expressly called God; for the words will not bear to be rendered, "thy throne is the throne of God, or thy throne is God"; or be supplied thus, "God shall establish thy throne": nor are the words an apostrophe to the father, but are spoken to the king, the subject of the psalm, who is distinguished from God the Father, being blessed and anointed by him; and this is put out of all doubt by the apostle, who says they are addressed "to the Son", who is not a created God, nor God by office, but by nature; for though the word "Elohim" is sometimes used of those who are not gods by nature; yet being here used absolutely, and the attributes of eternity, and most perfect righteousness, being ascribed to the person so called, prove him to be the true God; and this is the reason why his throne is everlasting, and his sceptre righteous, and why he should be worshipped, served, and obeyed. Dominion and duration of it are given to him; his throne denotes his kingly power, and government; which is general, over angels, good and bad; over men, righteous and wicked, even the greatest among them, the kings and princes of the earth: and special, over his church and people; and which is administered by his Spirit and grace in the hearts of his saints; and by his word and ordinances in his churches; and by his powerful protection of them from their enemies; and will be in a glorious manner in the latter day, and in heaven to all eternity; for his throne is for ever, and on it he will sit for ever: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; he will have no successor in it, nor can his government be subverted; and though he will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, it will not cease. <p>A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom; the sceptre is an ensign of royalty; and a sceptre of righteousness, or rightness, is expressive of the justice of government; the Syriac version renders it, "a sceptre stretched out"; which is a sceptre of mercy, as the instance of Ahasuerus stretching out his sceptre to Esther shows; and such is the Gospel of Christ, which holds forth and declares the mercy, grace, and love of God to men through Christ; and which may be called a sceptre of righteousness, since it reveals and directs to the righteousness of Christ, and encourages to works of righteousness; but here it designs the righteous administration of Christ's kingly office; for just and true are, have been, and ever will be his ways, as King of saints. <p>(z) Kimchi &amp; R.

The points in the quotation which make it relevant to the writer’s purpose are the ascription of <span class="ital">dominion and perpetuity</span> to the Son.

It does not matter, therefore, whether we translate “Thy throne is God” or “Thy throne, O God,” for the point here to be affirmed is not that the Messiah is Divine, but that He has a throne and everlasting dominion. Westcott adopts the rendering “God is thy throne,” and compares <a href="/psalms/71-3.htm" title="Be you my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: you have given commandment to save me; for you are my rock and my fortress.">Psalm 71:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-4.htm" title="Trust you in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:">Isaiah 26:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty....">Psalm 91:1-2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-27.htm" title="The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>. He thinks it scarcely possible that “God” can be addressed to the King. Vaughan, on the other hand, says: “Evidently a vocative. <span class="ital">God is thy throne</span> might possibly have been said (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm" title="God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.">Psalm 46:1</a>): <span class="ital">thy throne is God</span> seems an unnatural phrase.

The less strongly attested reading [see notes] gives the better sense: The sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness. The well-attested reading gives the sense: “The sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom”. The everlasting dominion affirmed in the former clause is now declared to be a righteous rule. An assurance of this is given in the the further statement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">But unto the Son he saith</span>] Rather “But of (lit., with reference to) the Son.” The Psalm (45) from which the quotation is taken, is called in the LXX. “A song for the beloved,” and has been Messianically interpreted by Jewish as well as Christian expositors.

But in the idealism and hyperbole of its expression it pointed forward to “the King in His beauty.” “Thy throne, O Elohim,” is the rendering which seems most natural, and this at once evidences the mystic and ideal character of the language; for though judges and rulers are sometimes collectively and indirectly called <span class="ital">Elohim</span> (<a href="/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-8.htm" title="If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, to see whether he have put his hand to his neighbor's goods.">Exodus 22:8</a>; Psalms 73; <a href="/context/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?...">John 10:34-36</a>) yet nothing which approaches a title so exalted is ever given to a human person, except in this typical sense (as in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>). The original, however, has been understood by some to mean “Thy divine throne;” and this verse maybe rendered “God is Thy throne for ever and ever.” Philo had spoken of the Logos as “the eldest Angel,” “an Archangel of many names” (<span class="ital">De Conf. Ling.</span> 28), and it was most necessary for the writer to shew that the Mediator of the New Covenant was not merely an Angel like the ministers of the Old, or even an Archangel, but the Divine Præ-existent Son whose dispensation therefore supersedes that which had been administered by inferior beings.

The preposition here translated "unto" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 7, there translated "of." As is evident from its use in ver. 7, it does not imply of necessity that the persons spoken of are <span class="accented">addressed</span> in the quotations, though it is so in this second case. The force of the preposition itself need only be "in reference to." The first quotation is from <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6, 7</a>. The psalm was evidently written originally as an epithalamium on the occasion of the marriage of some king of Israel to some foreign princess. The general and probable opinion is that the king was Solomon. His marriage with Pharaoh's daughter may have been the occasion. The view taken by some (as Hengstenberg), that the psalm had no original reference to an actual marriage, being purely a Messianic prophecy, is inconsistent both with its own contents and with the analogy of other Messianic psalms (see what was said on this head with reference to <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>.). Those who enter into the view of Messianic prophecy that has been given above, will have no difficulty in perceiving the justness of the application of this psalm to Christ, notwithstanding its primary import. Like <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, it presents (in parts at least) an ideal picture, suggested only and imperfectly realized by the temporary type; an ideal of which we find the germ in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, and the amplification in later prophecy. Further, the title, "For the precentor" (" To the chief musician," A.V.), shows that the psalm was used in the temple services, and thus, whatever might be the occasion of its composition, was understood by the Jews of old as having an ulterior meaning. Further, there is possibly (as Delitzsch points out) a reference to the psalm as Messianic in <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-3</a>, where "the Servant of Jehovah," "the Anointed," gives the "oil of gladness" for mourning; and in Isaiah 9:5, where the words of the psalm," God" (ver. 6) and "mighty" (ver. 3) are compounded for a designation of the Messiah; also in <a href="/zechariah/12-8.htm">Zechariah 12:8</a>, where it is prophesied that in the latter days" the house of David" shall be "as God." The Messianic interpretation is undoubtedly ancient. The Chaldee paraphrast (on ver. 3) writes, "Thy beauty, O King Messiah, is greater than that of the sons of men." <span class="cmt_word">Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever</span>. Attempts have been made to evade the conclusion that the king is here addressed as "God," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by taking the clause as a parenthetic address to God himself; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by regarding" God" as appended to "throne," or as the predicate of the sentence; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> translating either "Thy throne of God is," etc. (according to the sense of <a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>, "Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king"), or "Thy throne is God [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Divine] for ever and ever." As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, the context repudiates it. As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, it is a question whether the Hebrew is patient of the supposed construction. At any rate, "God" is understood as a vocative in the LXX. as well as in the Epistle, in which the LXX. is quoted (for the use of the nominative form, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, in a vocative sense, cf. <a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 13</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>; <a href="/mark/9-25.htm">Mark 9:25</a>; <a href="/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54</a>; <a href="/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>);' and in the Chaldee paraphrase, and all ancient versions, it is understood so also. Probably no other interpretation would have been thought of but for the difficulty of supposing an earthly king to be thus addressed. It is to be observed, however, that the other rendering would express essentially the same idea, and be sufficient for the argument. In either case the throne of the SON is represented as God's throne, and eternal. The only difference is that the vocative rendering makes more marked and manifest the ideal view of his subject taken by the psalmist. For it is most unlikely that a bard of the sanctuary, a worshipper of the jealous God of Israel, would have so apostrophized any earthly king except as prefiguring "a greater than Solomon" to come. It is true that kings are elsewhere called "gods" in the plural (as in <a href="/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>, referred to by our Lord, <a href="/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>); but the solemn addressing of an individual king by this title is (if the vocative rendering be correct) peculiar to this psalm. The passage (<a href="/1_samuel/28-13.htm">1 Samuel 28:13</a>) adduced in abatement of the significance of the title, where the apparition of Samuel is described by the witch of Endor as "<span class="accented">Elohim</span> ascending out of the earth," is not a parallel case. The word "Elohim" has a comprehensive meaning, depending on context for its precise significance. If vocatively used in a solemn address to a king sitting upon an everlasting throne, it surely implies the assigning of Divine honors to the king so addressed. In this case still more is implied than in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, where the King is spoken of as God's Son, enthroned on Zion, the Son being here addressed as himself "Elohim." It may be that the inspiring Spirit suggested language to the psalmist beyond his own comprehension at the time of utterance (see <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10, 11</a>). It may be added that the ultimate Messianic reference of the expression is confirmed by <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the title <span class="accented">El-Gibber</span> ("<span class="accented">M</span>ighty <span class="accented">God</span>," A.V.) distinctly used of God himself in Isaiah 10:21 (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>), is applied to the Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom</span>. In this and the following clause is expressed the important idea that the ideal throne of the SON is founded on <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, whence comes also his peculiar unction with "the oil of gladness." Only so far as Solomon or other theocratic kings exemplified the Divine righteousness, did they approach the ideal position assigned to the Son. cf. the latter part of ver. 14 in the original promise, <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, and especially <a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>, etc., in the "last words of David." Observe also the prominence of the idea in <a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>. and in later prophecy (cf. <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, God</span>, even <span class="cmt_word">thy God</span>. The first "<span class="accented">God"</span> here may be again in the vocative, as in the preceding verse, or it may be as the A.V. takes it (cf. <a href="/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows</span>. The primary reference <span class="accented">is</span>, not to the king's coronation (as in <a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>), but to unction as symbolical of blessing and joy, connected with the custom of anointing the head at feasts (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-40.htm">Deuteronomy 28:40</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>). "<span class="accented">Thy</span> fellows," in its original reference, seems most naturally to mean "thy associates in royalty," "other kings;" <span class="accented">cf.</span> <a href="/psalms/79.htm">Psalm 79</a>:27, "I will make him my Firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth." Or it might mean the companions of the bridegroom, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The latter reference lends itself readily to the fulfillment in Christ, the Bridegroom of the Church, whose <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> the redeemed are; themselves also being, after their measure, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (cf. <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20, 27</a>). But they are also made "kings and priests unto God" by Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>); so that either of the supposed original references may be shown to be typical, if it be thought necessary to find a definite fulfillment of all the details of the address to the theocratic king. The view that in the fulfillment the angels are to be understood as Christ's <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is inadmissible. There is nothing in the psalm to suggest the thought of them, nor does the way in which they are contrasted with the SON in this chapter admit of their being here spoken of as his <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>.
