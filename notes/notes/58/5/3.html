Over his own sin-offering the high priest made confession of sins, first for himself and his household, then for the priests; over the goat sent into the wilderness the sins of the people were confessed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him.

An additional reason for trusting in the priest is that he has not assumed the office to gratify his own ambition but to serve God’s purpose of restoring men to His fellowship. All genuine priesthood is the carrying out of God’s will. The priest must above all else be <span class="ital">obedient</span>, in sympathy with God as well as in sympathy with man. God’s appointment also secures that the suitable qualifications will be found in the priest. The office is here called <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span>, best translated by the German “Ehrenamt” or “Ehrenstelle.” For <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span> meaning an office see Eurip., <span class="ital">Helena</span>, 15; Herodot., ii. 65, <span class="greekheb">παῖς παρὰ πατρὸς ἐκδέκεται τὴν τιμήν</span>; and especially Aristotle, <span class="ital">Pol.</span>, iii. 10, <span class="greekheb">τιμὰς γὰρ λέγομεν εἶναι τὰς ἀρχάς</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Hor. i. 1, 8 “tergeminis honoribus”. Frequently in Josephus <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span> is used of the high priesthood, see <span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, xii. 2–5, <a href="/hebrews/4-1.htm" title="Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.">Hebrews 4:1</a>, etc.; and the same writer should be consulted for the historical illustration of this verse (<span class="ital">Antiq.</span>, iii. 8–1). In this remarkable passage he represents Moses as saying <span class="greekheb">ἔγωγε</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐμαυτὸν ἂν τῆς τιμῆς ἄξιον ἔκρινα</span> … <span class="greekheb">νῦν f1δʼ αὐτὸς ὁ Θεὸς Ἀαρῶνα τῆς τιμῆς ταύτης ἄξιον ἔκρινε</span>. The <span class="ital">nolo episcopari</span> implied in the words is amply illustrated in the case of Augustine, of John Knox, and especially of Anselm who declared he would rather have been cast on a stack of blazing faggots than set on the archiepiscopal throne, and continued to head his letters “Brother Anselm monk of Bec by choice, Archbishop of Canterbury by violence”. On the other hand, see the account of the appointment by his own act (<span class="greekheb">αὐτόχειρ</span>) of the priest king in Aricia, in Strabo <a href="/context/hebrews/5-3.htm" title="And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins....">Hebrews 5:3-12</a> and elsewhere. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καλούμενος</span> … <span class="greekheb">καθώσπερ καὶ Ἀαρών</span>. “but when called by God as in point of fact even Aaron was”. If the article is retained before <span class="greekheb">καλ</span>. we must translate “but he that is called,” <span class="greekheb">καλούμενος</span> “in diesem amtlichen Sinne nur hier,” says Weiss, but see <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-15.htm" title="But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,">Galatians 1:15</a>.

Consequently, their sin offering for themselves, in the first place, was a prominent part of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, which the writer may be supposed to have especially in view (<a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.). But can we suppose any corresponding necessity in the case of Christ? The argument does not absolutely require that we should, since the obligation of the Levitical high priest may be adduced only in proof of his own experience of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Christ, though under no such obligation, might still fulfill the requisites of a high priest, expressed in the case of sinful high priests by the obligation to offer for themselves; and we may (as Ebrard says) leave it to the writer to show hew he does fulfill them.
