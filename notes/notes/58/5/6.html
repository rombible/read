The fourth verse, here quoted, is the kernel of the Psalm, and supplies the theme for a large portion of this Epistle, especially Hebrews 7. As the promise of 2 Samuel 7 was the prelude to the revelation of the second Psalm, the divine declaration recorded in <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm" title="And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

The king of Israel was the type of the Son of David; and in the consecrated people, who, had they been faithful, would have remained the representatives of all nations before God, was dimly foreshadowed the Anointed Priest.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As he saith also in another place - <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>. "Thou art a priest forever." It is evident here that the apostle means to be understood as saying that the Psalm referred to Christ, and this is one of the instances of quotation from the Old Testament respecting which there can be no doubt. Paul makes much of this argument in a subsequent part of this Epistle, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a> and reasons as if no one would deny that the Psalm had a reference to the Messiah. It is clear from this that the Psalm was understood by the Jews at that time to have such a reference, and that it was so universally admitted that no one would call it in question. That the Psalm refers to the Messiah has been the opinion of nearly all Christian commentators, and has been admitted by the Jewish Rabbis in general also. The "evidence" that it refers to the Messiah is such as the following:<p>(1) It is a Psalm of David, and yet is spoken of one who was superior to him, and whom he calls his "Lord;" <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>.<p>(2) it cannot be referred to Jehovah himself, for he is expressly <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a> distinguished from him who is here addressed.<p>(3) it cannot be referred to anyone in the time of David, for there was no one to whom he would attribute this character of superiority but God.<p>(4) for the same reason there was no one among his posterity, except the Messiah, to whom he would apply this language.<p>(5) it is expressly ascribed by the Lord Jesus to himself; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm">Matthew 22:43-44</a>.<p>(6) the scope of the Psalm is such as to be applicable to the Messiah, and there is no part of it which would be inconsistent with such a reference. Indeed, there is no passage of the Old Testament of which it would be more universally conceded that there was a reference to the Messiah, than this Psalm.<p>Thou art a priest - He is not here called a "high priest," for Melchizedek did not bear that title, nor was the Lord Jesus to be a high priest exactly in the sense in which the name was given to Aaron and his successors. A word is used, therefore, in a general sense to denote that he would be a "priest" simply, or would sustain the priestly office. This was all that was needful to the present argument which was, that he was "designated by God" to the priestly office, and that he had not intruded himself into it.<p>For ever - This was an important circumstance, of which the apostle makes much use in another part of the Epistle; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-8.htm">Hebrews 7:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-24</a>. The priesthood of the Messiah was not to change from hand to hand; it was not to be laid down at death; it was to remain unchangeably the same.<p>After the order - The word rendered "order" - &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  taxis - means "a setting in order - hence, "arrangement" or "disposition." It may be applied to ranks of soldiers; to the gradations of office; or to any rank which men sustain in society. To say that he was of the same "order" with Melchizedek, was to say that he was of the same "rank" or "stations." He was like him in his designation to the office. In what respects he was like him the apostle shows more fully in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>. "One" particular in which there was a striking resemblance, which did not exist between Christ and any other high priest, was, that Melchizedek was both a "priest" and a "king." None of the kings of the Jews were priests; nor were any of the priests ever elevated to the office of king. But in Melchizedek these offices were united, and this fact constituted a striking resemblance between him and the Lord Jesus. It was on this principle that there was such pertinency in quoting here the passage from the second Psalm; see <a href="/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5</a>. The meaning is, that Melchizedek was of a special rank or order; that he was not numbered with the Levitical priests, and that there were important features in his office which differed from theirs. In those features it was distinctly predicted that the Messiah would resemble him.<p>Melchisedek - see the notes on <a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1</a> ff. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. He is here called simply "Priest"; in Heb 5:5, "High Priest." He is a Priest absolutely, because He stands alone in that character without an equal. He is "High Priest" in respect of the Aaronic type, and also in respect to us, whom He has made priests by throwing open to us access to God [Bengel]. "The order of Melchisedec" is explained in Heb 7:15, "the similitude of Melchisedec." The priesthood is similarly combined with His kingly office in Zec 6:13. Melchisedec was at once man, priest, and king. Paul's selecting as the type of Christ one not of the stock of Abraham, on which the Jews prided themselves, is an intimation of Messianic universalism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As he saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest for ever:</span> the Spirit proves his call and investiture into this office, its confirmation to him for ever, by another testimony of the Father about it, penned by David, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a></span>, and ratified to be so by the Lord himself, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/22-41.htm" title="While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,...">Matthew 22:41-45</a></span>; that he as man was David’s Son: as God-man, David’s Lord, and the grand officer to atone God by his sacrifice for sinners, and to intercede for them.
