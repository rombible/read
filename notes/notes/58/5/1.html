For as the unbelieving Jews, and probably many of those who believed, did not acknowledge his apostleship, St. Paul knew that his affirmation of these matters would not be held by them as sufficient evidence. His proof of the priesthood of Christ he begins in this chapter, in the course of which he shows, that whatever was excellent in the Levitical priesthood, is in Christ, and in a more eminent manner. And whatever excellence was wanting in those priests, is in him. <span class="ital">For </span>— Or <span class="ital">now; every high-priest </span>— As if he had said, To show that Christ is a real High-Priest, I will describe the designation, the duties, and the qualifications of a high-priest, by which it will appear that all the essential parts of that office are found in him; <span class="ital">taken from among men </span>— Being, till he is taken, of the same rank with them; <span class="ital">is ordained </span>— Appointed, set apart for that office; <span class="ital">for men </span>— For their benefit; <span class="ital">in things pertaining to God </span>— To bring God near to men, and men to God; <span class="ital">that he may offer both gifts </span>— Out of things inanimate; <span class="ital">and sacrifices </span>— Of animals; to atone <span class="ital">for sins </span>— <span class="ital">“Gifts, </span>or freewill-offerings, as distinguished from sacrifices for sins, were expressions of gratitude to God for his goodness in the common dispensations of his providence.

This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. But are we of that number?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For every high priest - That is, among the Jews, for the remarks relate to the Jewish system. The Jews had one high priest who was regarded as the successor of Aaron. The word "high priest" means "chief priest;" that is, a priest of higher rank and office than others. By the original regulation the Jewish high priest was to be of the family of Aaron <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>, though in later times the office was frequently conferred on others. In the time of the Romans it had become venal, and the Mosaic regulation was disregarded; 2 Macc. 4:7; Josephus, Ant. xv. 3. 1. It was no longer held for life, so that there were several persons at one time to whom was given the title of high priest. The high priest was at the head of religious affairs, and was the ordinary judge of all that pertained to religion, and even of the general justice of the Hebrew commonwealth; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-9.htm">Deuteronomy 27:9-10</a>.<p>He only had the privilege of entering the most holy place once a year, on the great day of atonement, to make expiation for the sins of the people; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. He was to be the son of one who had married a virgin, and was to be free from any corporeal defect; <a href="/leviticus/21-13.htm">Leviticus 21:13</a>. The "dress" of the high priest was much more costly and magnificent than that of the inferior order of priests; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/39-1.htm">Exodus 39:1-7</a>. He wore a mantle or robe - &#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1500;  me &#768;iyl - of blue, with the borders embroidered with pomegranates in purple and scarlet; an "ephod" - &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1491;  &#8219;ephowd - made of cotton, with crimson, purple, and blue, and ornamented with gold worn over the robe or mantle, without sleeves, and divided below the arm-pits into two parts or halves, of which one was in front covering the breast, and the other behind covering the back. In the ephod was a breastplate of curious workmanship, and on the head a mitre. The breastplate was a piece of broidered work about ten inches square, and was made double, so as to answer the purpose of a pouch or bag. It was adorned with twelve precious stones, each one having the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The two upper corners of the breastplate were fastened to the ephod, and the two lower to the girdle.<p>Taken from among men - There maybe an allusion here to the fact that the great High Priest of the Christian dispensation had a higher than human origin, and was selected from a rank far above people. Or it may be that the meaning is, that every high priest on earth - including all under the old dispensation and the great high priest of the new - is ordained with reference to the welfare of people, and to bring some valuable offering forman to God.<p>Is ordained for men - Is set apart or consecrated for the welfare of people. The Jewish high priest was set apart to his office with great solemnity; see <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29</a>:p>In things pertaining to God - In religious matters, or with reference to the worship and service of God. He was not to be a civil ruler, nor a teacher of science, nor a military leader, but his business was to superintend the affairs of religion.<p>That he may offer both gifts - That is, thank-offerings, or oblations which would be the expressions of gratitude. Many such offerings were made by the Jews under the laws of Moses, and the high priest was the medium by whom they were to be presented to God.<p>And sacrifices for sin - Bloody offerings; offerings made of slain beasts. The blood of expiation was sprinkled by him on the mercyseat, and he was the appointed medium by which such sacrifices were to be presented to God; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-6.htm">Hebrews 9:6-10</a>. We may remark here:<p>(1) that the proper office of a priest is to present a "sacrifice" for sin.<p>(2) it is "improper" to give the name "priest" to a minister of the gospel. The reason is, that he offers no sacrifice; he sprinkles no blood. He is appointed to "preach the word," and to lead the devotions of the church, but not to offer sacrifice. Accordingly the New Testament preserves entire consistency on this point, for the name "priest" is never once given to the apostles, or to any other minister of the gospel.<p>Among the Papists there is "consistency" - though gross and dangerous error - in the use of the word "priest." They believe that the minister of religion offers up" the real body and blood of our Lord;" that the bread and wine are changed by the words of consecration into the "body and blood, the soul and divinity, of the Lord Jesus" (Decrees of the Council of Trent), and that "this" is really offered by him as a sacrifice. Accordingly they "elevate the host;" that is, lift up, or offer the sacrifice and, require all to bow before it and worship, and with this view they are "consistent" in retaining the word "priest." But why should this name be applied to a "Protestant" minister, who believes that all this is blasphemy, and who claims to have no "sacrifice" to offer when he comes to minister before God? The great sacrifice; the one sufficient atonement, has been offered - and the ministers of the gospel are appointed to proclaim that truth to men, not to offer sacrifices for sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>Heb 5:1-14.

This was accomplished in Christ’s person, and he hath not since selected out of men any such order of priests properly so called in the Christian church. His officers being so far from being high priests, that they are not so much as in the enumeration of their titles styled iereiv, priests; and as far is it from truth, that there are now as priests, so altars, sacrifices, temples in the Christian church properly so called; since it is expressly against the New Testament, and if so spoken of by the fathers, it must be understood figuratively and metaphorically, or else it is untrue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is ordained for men in things pertaining to God; </span> kayistatai, the designed person, is constituted and set over others for their good, to seek either temporal or spiritual good, as the office is: compare <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a></span>.

Either turn of discourse was equally open to the choice of the author.

What the author had had to say with regard to this was already clear to the readers from the earlier disquisitions of the epistle itself. The element of the homogeneity of Christ with the Jewish high priest, namely, that He, like the Jewish high priest, can have sympathy with sinful man, since He had become in all points like unto men His brethren, had been fully traced out in the second chapter, and attention is called anew to it in <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a> by the <span class="greekheb">δυνάμενον συμπαθῆσαι ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">πεπειρασμένον κατὰ πάντα καθʼ ὁμοιότητα</span>. The element of the dissimilarity, on the other hand, namely, that while the Jewish high priest had to offer for his own sins, Christ was without sin, is first brought prominently forward in <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a> by means of <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span>, and, besides this, followed already from the exalted position the author had, in the opening chapters of the epistle, assigned to Christ as the Son of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That, in reality, also the paragraph <a href="/context/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;...">Hebrews 5:7-10</a>, no less than <a href="/context/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you....">Hebrews 5:5-6</a>, is subordinate to the second main consideration, expressed <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm" title="And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.">Hebrews 5:4</a>, has been denied, it is true, by Beza, Schlichting, Hammond, Limborch, Storr, Delitzsch, Maier, Moll, and others.

There is no need to extend the reference, as Peirce does, to “others who were not of that order”. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἀνθρώπων λαμβανόμενος</span>, “being taken from among men,” not, “who is taken from etc.,” as if defining a certain peculiar and exceptional kind of high priest. It might almost be rendered “since he is taken from among men”; for the writer means that all priesthood proceeds on this foundation, and it is this circumstance that involves what is afterwards more fully insisted upon, that the high priest has sympathy. For <span class="greekheb">λαμβ</span>. <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/numbers/25-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.">Numbers 25:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-6.htm" title="Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.">Numbers 8:6</a>. On the present tense, see below. Grotius renders “segregare, ut quae ex acervo desumimus”. Being taken from among men every high priest is also appointed not for his own sake or to fulfil his own purposes, but <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων καθίσταται</span>, “is appointed in man’s behalf”; not with Calvin, “ordinat ea quae ad Deum pertinent,” taking <span class="greekheb">καθ</span>. as middle. The word is in common use in classical writers. “The customariness [implied in <span class="greekheb">λαμβ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">καθ</span>.] applies not to the action of the individual member of the class, but to that of the class as a whole”. Burton, <span class="ital">M. and T.</span>, cxxiv. <span class="greekheb">τὰ πρὸς τὸν θεόν</span>, “in things relating to God”; an adverbial accusative as in <a href="/romans/15-17.htm" title="I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.">Romans 15:17</a>.

In all that relates to God the high priest must mediate for men; but he is appointed especially and primarily, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα προσφέρῃ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτιῶν</span>, “that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins”. Were there no sins there would be no priest. The fact that we are sinners, therefore, should not daunt us, or prevent our using the intercession of the priest. <span class="greekheb">προσφέρειν</span>, technical term, like our “offer”; not so used in the classics. <span class="greekheb">δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίας</span>, the same combination is found in <a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm" title="For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.">Hebrews 8:3</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm" title="Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;">Hebrews 9:9</a> with the same conjunctions. <span class="greekheb">Δῶρα</span> as well as <span class="greekheb">θυσίαι</span> include all kinds of sacrifices and offerings.
