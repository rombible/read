This is peculiarly the case here: there would be no difficulty in conceiving how Christ could be said to be <span class="ital">made perfect, </span>if we observed, 1st, That he was <span class="ital">very man, </span>and that his human nature, before his resurrection, was in a state of infirmity, and not of perfection, his body being subject to various weaknesses, and the faculties of his soul, of course, being influenced thereby. While in his childhood he is said to have increased in <span class="ital">wisdom </span>as well as in stature, namely, as the powers of his mind were gradually unfolded, and subjects, through the medium of his senses, were presented to his contemplation. And if he increased in wisdom, he must, of course, have increased in love to God and man, and all other graces and virtues, though always perfectly free from every defilement of sin, internal or external: but when he was raised from the dead, and exalted to his Father’s right hand, his human nature was fully and for ever freed from this state of infirmity, and was rendered completely perfect. This, however, does not appear to be the meaning of the word <span class="ital">perfect </span>here, but the expression rather refers, 2d, To his having fully accomplished the work he had to do, and the sufferings he had to endure in order to his being a perfect Mediator and Saviour. Accordingly the expression here used by the apostle, <span class="greekheb">τελειωθεις</span>, is literally <span class="ital">being perfected, </span>answering directly to the word used <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">τελειωσαι</span>, <span class="ital">to perfect by sufferings; </span>only there it is used <span class="ital">actively, it became him </span>(God the Father) <span class="ital">to make perfect the Captain of our salvation; </span>here it is used <span class="ital">passively, </span>with respect to the effect of that act, and signifies his being <span class="ital">consummated, </span>or having finished his whole process, from his leaving the celestial glory to his returning to it; which process it was absolutely necessary he should accomplish, that his character, as a High-Priest, might be completed, and he might be consecrated as such. This, 3d, Is another meaning of the term, and a meaning given it by our translators at the close of the seventh chapter, where they have rendered <span class="greekheb">τετελειωμενων</span>, (another participle of the same verb,) <span class="ital">consecrated </span>or dedicated to his high office. The priests under the law were consecrated by the death and oblation of the beasts offered in sacrifice at their consecration, (Exodus 29.,) but it belonged to the perfection of Christ as a high-priest, that he should be consecrated by his own sufferings. This was necessary both from the nature of the office, to which he was to be solemnly set apart, and to answer the types of the Aaronical priesthood. This, however, was only the external means of his consecration, and an evidence thereof. He was really consecrated by the act of God the Father, who said, <span class="ital">Thou art my Son, </span>&c., and by his own act when he said, <span class="ital">Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He became the author </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αιτιος</span>, <span class="ital">the cause, </span>both the meritorious and efficient cause; <span class="ital">of eternal salvation </span>— As procuring it for us by his obedience unto death, and conferring it upon us in all its branches, in consequence of his ascension and exaltation; <span class="ital">to all those that obey him </span>— The expression is emphatical: the salvation belongs <span class="ital">only </span>to those that obey him, and it belongs to all such. And as the Greek term here used imports to obey <span class="ital">upon hearing, </span>the obedience intended Isaiah , 1 st, Faith, which cometh by hearing. 2d, The subjection of the heart, of the will and affections to him, in consequence of faith; and, 3d, A uniform complying with the will of God as far as it is known to us, (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm" title="Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 7:21</a>,) or a conscientious, steady, and persevering obedience to all the precepts of the gospel. For only <span class="ital">blessed are they that do his commandments, </span>because they, and only they, shall have <span class="ital">a right to the tree of life, </span><a href="/revelation/22-14.htm" title="Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.">Revelation 22:14</a>. Thus, as Macknight observes, “in this verse three things are clearly stated: 1st, That obedience to Christ is equally necessary to salvation with believing on him. 2d, That he was made perfect as a high-priest, by offering himself a sacrifice for sin; and, 3d, That by the merit of that sacrifice he hath obtained pardon and eternal life for them who obey him.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-10 The High Priest must be a man, a partaker of our nature. This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him.

This efficient cause produceth this only to the duty qualified subject: mankind is rendered salvable by the obedience and sacrifice of this High Priest; but it is only to penitent believing sinners that he doth communicate this, and for whom he effects it; those who will entirely submit themselves to Christ as a Lord and King, and be loyal to him and obey him, as well as to a Priest or a Saviour, continuing his faithful subjects to the end, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>,18,36</span>; compare <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/10-22.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.">Matthew 10:22</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hebrews/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And being made perfect,....

If it be objected that his high priesthood must have begun <span class="accented">before</span> the Resurrection for his death upon the cross to be a true atonement, it may be replied that his one oblation of himself upon the cross at once consummated his consecration and effected the atonement. Doubtless, as a true High Priest on earth, he thus "offered one sacrifice for sins for ever" (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>); all that is meant above is that it was not till after the Resurrection that he entered on his eternal office of mediation in virtue of that one accomplished sacrifice. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And being made perfect (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Comp. <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>.
