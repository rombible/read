Paul knew that what be had to say of this man as a type of the Redeemer would excite wonder, and that many might be disposed to call it in question. He knew that in order to be understood, what he was about to say required a familiar acquaintance with the Scriptures, and a strong and elevated faith. A young convert; one who had just commenced the Christian life, could hardly expect to be able to understand it. The same thing is true now. One of the first questions which a young convert often asks, is, Who was Melchizedek? And one of the things which most uniformly perplex those who begin to study the Bible, is, the statement which is made about this remarkable man.<p>Hard to be uttered - Rather, hard to be "interpreted," or "explained." So the Greek word means.<p>Seeing ye are dull of hearing - That is, when they ought to have been acquainted with the higher truths of religion, they had shown that they received them slowly, and were dull of apprehension. On what particular "fact" Paul grounded this charge respecting them is unknown; nor could we know, unless we were better acquainted with the persons to whom he wrote, and their circumstances, than we now are. But he had doubtless in his eye some fact which showed that they were slow to understand the great principles of the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Here he digresses to complain of the low spiritual attainments of the Palestinian Christians and to warn them of the danger of falling from light once enjoyed; at the same time encouraging them by God's faithfulness to persevere. At Heb 6:20 he resumes the comparison of Christ to Melchisedec.<p>hard to be uttered&#8212;rather as Greek, "hard of interpretation to speak." Hard for me to state intelligibly to you owing to your dulness about spiritual things. Hence, instead of saying many things, he writes in comparatively few words (Heb 13:22). In the "we," Paul, as usual, includes Timothy with himself in addressing them.<p>ye are&#8212;Greek, "ye have become dull" (the Greek, by derivation, means hard to move): this implies that once, when first "enlightened," they were earnest and zealous, but had become dull. That the Hebrew believers AT Jerusalem were dull in spiritual things, and legal in spirit, appears from Ac 21:20-24, where James and the elders expressly say of the "thousands of Jews which believe," that "they are all zealous of the law"; this was at Paul's last visit to Jerusalem, after which this Epistle seems to have been written (see on [2551]Heb 5:12, on "for the time").<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Spirit here digresseth from discoursing further of the priesthood of Christ, that he may fit these Hebrews to apprehend and improve it when he shall return to it, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a></span>.

Either of Melchizedek, or of Christ, or of his priesthood or of all of these; since the apostle does largely treat of them in the following chapters: he says many things concerning Melchizedek in the seventh chapter, and many things of Christ, and his priesthood, in those that follow; Christ is a large and inexhaustible subject in the Gospel ministry, and what a Gospel minister delights to dwell on; and it is a fund and stock from whence he is furnished with things of the greatest usefulness, and of the utmost importance: <p>and hard to be uttered; as were many things respecting Melchizedek, mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a> and also concerning Christ, and his priesthood: abstruse and difficult things are to be looked into, considered, searched after, and insisted on: the whole Scripture is profitable, and the whole counsel of God is to be declared, and things hard to be explained should be attempted; this is the way to an increase of light and knowledge; though it becomes ministers to consult their own abilities, and the capacity of their hearers, that they do not go beyond them: <p>seeing ye are dull of hearing; this dulness of hearing is thought by some to arise from their afflictions; or from their attachment to the law of Moses; or rather from their sluggishness, indocility, and want of industry; and often times this arises from pride and prejudice, and irreverence of the word of God; and frequently from the deceitfulness of riches, and the cares of this life. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</span><p>(6) A digression until he comes to the beginning of the seventh chapter; Heb 5:11-6:20: in which he partly holds the Hebrews in the diligent consideration of those things which he has said, and partly prepares them for the understanding of those things of which he will speak.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div>to <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a><a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11</a> to <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>. The author is on the point of turning to the nearer presentation of the dignity of High Priest after the manner of Melchisedec, which pertains to Christ, and thus of His superiority over the Levitical high priests. But before he passes over to this, he complains in a digression of the low stage of Christian knowledge at which the readers are yet standing, whereas they ought long ago themselves to have been teachers of Christianity; exhorts them to strive after manhood and maturity in Christianity, and with warning admonition points out that those who have already had experience of the rich blessing of Christianity, and nevertheless apostatize from the same, let slip beyond the possibility of recall the Christian salvation; then, however, expresses his confidence that such state of things will not be the case with the readers, who have distinguished themselves, and still do distinguish themselves, by works of Christian love, and indicates that which he desires of them,—namely, endurance to the end,—while at the same time reminding them of the inviolability of the divine promise and the objective certainty of the Christian hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περὶ οὗ</span>] <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ ἀρχιερέως κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδέκ</span>. To this total-conception, as is also recognised by Riehm (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 780), is <span class="greekheb">περὶ οὗ</span> to be referred back. We have to supplement not merely <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> (Oecumenius, Primasius, Justinian), because that would be a far too general defining of the object, inasmuch as confessedly the discourse is not first about Christ in the sequel, but everywhere throughout the epistle. But neither is <span class="greekheb">Μελχισεδέκ</span> to be supplied to <span class="greekheb">οὗ</span> (Peshito, Calvin [Piscator hesitates between this and the following application], Owen, Schöttgen, Peirce, Semler, Chr. Fr. Schmid, Bleek, de Wette, Tholuck, Alford, Maier, <span class="ital">al</span>.). For even though—a fact to which Bleek appeals—the author, after having concluded the digression (<a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1</a> f.), begins by characterizing this same Melchisedec, yet this description is subordinated to a higher aim, that of setting forth the high-priestly dignity of Christ; as surely also the reference of <a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1</a> ff. to the close of the digression (<a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>) clearly shows, since the former is represented by <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> as only the development now begun of the main consideration: <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδὲκ ἀρχιερεὺς γενόμενος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</span>, taken up anew, <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>. To take <span class="greekheb">οὗ</span> as a <span class="ital">neuter</span>, with Grotius, Cramer, Storr, Abresch, Böhme, Kuinoel, Klee, Stein, Stengel, Bisping, Delitzsch, Kurtz, and others, and to refer it to the <span class="ital">high-priesthood</span> of Christ after Melchisedec’s manner,—according to which <span class="greekheb">οὗ</span> would thus have to be resolved into <span class="greekheb">περὶ τοῦ προσαγορευθῆναι αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ ἀρχιερέα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισεδέκ</span>,—is possible indeed, but not so natural as when it is taken as a <span class="ital">masculine</span>, since the discourse in that which precedes was about the definite person of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πολὺς ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος</span>] <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span>.

Cappellus, Grotius, Peirce, Chr. Fr. Schmid, Valckenaer, Kuinoel, and others, to suppose the difficulty of the exposition or rendering intelligible of the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> to exist on the part of <span class="ital">the readers</span>, and thus to interpret <span class="greekheb">δυσερμήνευτος</span> in the sense of <span class="greekheb">δυσνόητος</span> <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2 Peter 3:16</a>. On the contrary, as <span class="ital">the author</span> has abundant material for discoursing on the subject announced, so is it also difficult for <span class="ital">the author</span> to render himself intelligible thereon to the readers. The ground of this difficulty which obtains for him is introduced by the clause with <span class="greekheb">ἐπεί</span>, which on that account is to be referred only to <span class="greekheb">δυσερμήνευτος λέγειν</span>, not at the same time (Hofmann) to <span class="greekheb">πολὺς ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος</span>. For the rest, Storr and Bleek have already rightly remarked, that in the connecting of <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> with the two predicates <span class="greekheb">πολύς</span> and <span class="greekheb">δυσερμήνευτος</span> a sort of zeugma is contained, inasmuch as <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> is to be taken in relation to the first predicate <span class="ital">actively</span>,[74] in relation to the second <span class="ital">passively</span>. On the high-priesthood of Christ after the manner of Melchisedec, the author has much <span class="ital">to speak</span>; and truly it is difficult for him to make plain to his readers the <span class="ital">contents</span> or <span class="ital">subject</span> of his discourse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γεγόνατε</span>] characterizes the spiritual sluggishness or dulness of the readers not as something which was originally inherent in them, but only as something which afterwards manifested itself in connection with them.

He is entering on a new theme, higher and less level to the comprehension of his readers than any that has gone before. Even so far, we have seen how their Jewish prejudices had evoked admonitions, frequently interposed in the course of the argument. Much more so now, when it is to be shown how the priesthood of Christ not only fulfils the idea of, but also supersedes, that of the sons of Aaron, being of a different order from theirs. The region of thought to be entered now, being that of "<span class="accented">the</span> mystery of Christ," transcends more than any that has been so far entered the ordinary conceptions of traditional Judaism. Hence the writer's shrinking from entering all at once on the subject for fear of not being even understood; hence his earnest warnings to his readers as to the necessity of advancing to the state of full-grown Christians who can discern spiritual things. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>. - INTERPOSED EXHORTATION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of whom</span> (the most obvious antecedent being Melchizedek, but with regard to his typical significance, as referred to in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">we have many things to say</span> (the subject itself admits a lengthy exposition) and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become (not, as in A.V., "ye are") dull of hearing, Their dullness is the reason of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It was not that the subject was in itself inexplicable, or that the writer was incompetent to explain it; his difficulty was in adapting the interpretation to the capacity of his readers: "Non scribentis, sed vestro vitio" (Bengel). It seems from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("ye are become"), in this and the following verse, that the Hebrew Christians had even retrograded in spiritual perception. This is easily conceivable. As, through the teaching of St. Paul especially, the tie between Christianity and Judaism became more and more broken, there was likely to be a certain reaction among the Hebrew Christians, who, having gone to a certain extent with the tide of thought, became conscious how far it was carrying them. They would be inclined to cling the more fondly to their old associations from the fear of losing them altogether. Such retrogressions have been observable in other times of upheaval of old ideas. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>From this point the comparison of Christ with Melchisedec would naturally be developed; but the author digresses into a complaint of the imperfect spiritual attainment of his readers, and a remonstrance and admonition extending to the end of ch. 6.<p>Of whom (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;)<p>Rend. concerning which.
