This shows that man had sinned. For God would not suffer sinful man to come to him alone. But every one is welcome to God, that comes to him by this High Priest; and as we value acceptance with God, and pardon, we must apply by faith to this our great High Priest Christ Jesus, who can intercede for those that are out of the way of truth, duty, and happiness; one who has tenderness to lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery. Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with him, and his presence and blessing on them and their services, that are called of God. This is applied to Christ. In the days of his flesh, Christ made himself subject to death: he hungered: he was a tempted, suffering, dying Jesus. Christ set an example, not only to pray, but to be fervent in prayer. How many dry prayers, how few wetted with tears, do we offer up to God! He was strengthened to support the immense weight of suffering laid upon him. There is no real deliverance from death but to be carried through it. He was raised and exalted, and to him was given the power of saving all sinners to the uttermost, who come unto God through him. Christ has left us an example that we should learn humble obedience to the will of God, by all our afflictions. We need affliction, to teach us submission. His obedience in our nature encourages our attempts to obey, and for us to expect support and comfort under all the temptations and sufferings to which we are exposed. Being made perfect for this great work, he is become the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him.

Christ became for all believers author of everlasting blessedness, in that He was saluted (or named) of God as High Priest after the manner of Melchisedec. That is to say: In order to become the mediate cause of salvation for others, Christ must be the possessor of high-priestly dignity; but this was ascribed to Him on the part of God in the utterance from the psalm, already cited in <a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>.

Originally called to the priesthood by the words of Psalms 110, He is now by His resurrection and ascension declared to be perfectly consecrated and so installed as High Priest after the order of Melchizedek. It may be doubted, however, whether the full meaning of <span class="greekheb">προσαγορεύειν</span> “address” should here be found. The commoner meaning in writers of the time is “named” or “called”. Thus in Plutarch’s <span class="ital">Pericles</span>, iv. 4, Anaxagoras, <span class="greekheb">ὃν Νοῦν προσηγόρευον</span>, xxvii. 2, <span class="greekheb">λευκὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην προσαγ</span>., xxiv. 6, of Aspasia, <span class="greekheb">Ηρα προσαγορεύεται</span>. and viii. 2 of Pericles himself, <span class="greekheb">Ὀλύμπιον</span> … <span class="greekheb">προσαγορευθῆναι</span>. So in Diod. Sic., i. 51, of the Egyptians, <span class="greekheb">τάφους ἀϊδίους οἴκους προσαγορεύουσιν</span>. It cannot be certainly concluded either from the tense or the context that this “naming” is to be assigned to the date of the ascension and not to the original appointment. The emphasis is on the words <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, not by man but by God has Christ been named High Priest; and on <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Μελχ</span>. as warranting <span class="greekheb">αἰωνίου</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage <a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11</a> to <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a> is a digression occasioned by the writer’s reflection that his argument from the priesthood of Melchizedek may be too difficult for his hearers. In order to stimulate attention he chides and warns them, pointing out the danger of backwardness. He justifies, however, his delivery of difficult doctrine notwithstanding their sluggishness, and this on two grounds: (1) because to lay again the foundations after men have once known them is useless (<a href="/context/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,...">Hebrews 6:1-8</a>); and (2) because he cannot but believe that his readers are after all in scarcely so desperate a condition. They need to have their hope renewed. This hope they have every reason to cherish, seeing that their fathers have already entered into the enjoyment of it, that God who cannot lie has sworn to the fulfilment of the promises, and that Jesus has entered the heavenly world as their forerunner. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">called</span>] Lit, “saluted” or “addressed by God as.” This is the only place in the N.T. where the verb occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a high priest after the order of Melchisedec</span>] We should here have expected the writer to enter at once on the explanation of this term. But he once more pauses for a solemn exhortation and warning. These pauses and landing places (as it were) in his argument, cannot be regarded as mere digressions. There is nothing that they less resemble than St Paul’s habit of “going off at a word,” nor is the writer in the least degree “hurried aside by the violence of his thoughts.” There is in him a complete absence of all the hurry and impetuosity which characterise the style of St Paul. His movements are not in the least like those of an eager athlete, but they rather resemble the stately walk of some Oriental Sheykh with all his robes folded around him. He is about to enter on an entirely original and far from obvious argument, which he felt would have great weight in checking the tendency to look back to the rites, the splendours and the memories of Judaism. He therefore stops with the calmest deliberation, and the most wonderful skill, to pave the way for his argument by a powerful mixture of reproach and warning—which assisted the object he had in view, and tended to stimulate the spiritual dulness of his readers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προσαγορευθεἱς</span>) <span class="ital">called</span>.
