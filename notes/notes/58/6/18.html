But he does not speak of that which was <span class="ital">within the veil, </span>namely, the ark and mercy-seat, the tables of stone, and cherubim, the work of men’s hands, but of the things signified by them; God himself on a throne of grace, and the Lord Christ, as the high-priest of the church, at his right hand: or the Father as the author, the Lord Jesus as the purchaser, and the covenant as the conveyer of all grace; which were all typically represented by the things <span class="ital">within the veil. </span>And the apostle makes use of this allusion to instruct the Hebrews in the nature and use of the old tabernacle institutions; and from thence in the true nature of the priesthood of Christ, to which he is now returning. The meaning is, that the believer’s <span class="ital">hope </span>lays hold on God himself, on a throne of grace and on Christ as the High-Priest of the church, who is in heaven itself, the place of God’s presence, typified by the holy of holies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-20 The hope here meant, is a sure looking for good things promised, through those promises, with love, desire, and valuing of them. Hope has its degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has made to believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between the eternal Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely be depended upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, the counsel and the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God to lie; it would be contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And as He cannot lie; the destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation of the believer, are alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God has given full security of happiness, have a title to the promises by inheritance. The consolations of God are strong enough to support his people under their heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinners who flee to the mercy of God, through the redemption of Christ, according to the covenant of grace, laying aside all other confidences. We are in this world as a ship at sea, tossed up and down, and in danger of being cast away. We need an anchor to keep us sure and steady. Gospel hope is our anchor in the storms of this world. It is sure and stedfast, or it could not keep us so. The free grace of God, the merits and mediation of Christ, and the powerful influences of his Spirit, are the grounds of this hope, and so it is a stedfast hope. Christ is the object and ground of the believer's hope. Let us therefore set our affections on things above, and wait patiently for his appearance, when we shall certainly appear with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That by two immutable things - What the "two immutable things" here referred to are, has been made a matter of question among commentators. Most expositors, as Doddridge, Whitby, Rosenmuller, Koppe, and Calvin, suppose that the reference is to the promise and the oath of God, each of which would be a firm ground of the assurance of salvation, and in each of which it would be impossible for God to lie. Prof. Stuart supposes that the reference is to "two oaths" - the oath made to Abraham, and that by which the Messiah was made High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek; <a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6</a>, <a href="/hebrews/5-10.htm">Hebrews 5:10</a>. He supposes that thus the salvation of believers would be amply secured, by the promise that Abraham should have a Son, the Messiah, in whom all the families of the earth would be blessed, and in the oath that this Son should be High Priest forever. But to this interpretation it may be objected that the apostle seems to refer to two things distinct from each other in their nature, and not to two acts of the same kind. There are two kinds of security referred to, whereas the security furnished according to this interpretation would be the same - that arising from an oath. However numerous the oaths might be, still it would be security of the same kind, and if one of them were broken no certainty could be derived from the other. On the supposition, however, that he refers to the "promise" and the "oath," there would be two kinds of assurance of different kinds. On the supposition that the "promise" was disregarded - if such a supposition may be made still there would be the security of the "oath" - and thus the assurance of salvation was two-fold. It seems to me, therefore, that the apostle refers to the "promise" and to the "oath" of God, as constituting the two grounds of security for the salvation of his people. Those things were both unchangeable, and when his word and oath are once passed, what he promises is secure.<p>In which it was impossible for God to lie - That is, it would be contrary to his nature; it is not for a moment to be supposed; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>, "God - that cannot lie." The impossibility is a "moral" impossibility, and the use of the word here explains the sense in which the words "impossible, cannot," etc., are often used in the Scriptures. The meaning here is, that such was the love of God for truth; such his holiness of character, that he "could" not speak falsely.<p>We might have a strong consolation - The strongest of which the mind can conceive. The consolation of a Christian is not in his own strength; his hope of heaven is not in any reliance on his own powers. His comfort is, that God has "promised" eternal life to his people, and that He cannot prove false to his word; <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>.<p>Who have fled for refuge - Referring to the fact that one charged with murder fled to the city of refuge, or laid hold on an altar for security. So we guilty and deserving of death have fled to the hopes of the gospel in the Redeemer.<p>To lay hold upon - To seize and hold fast - as one does an altar when he is pursued by the avenger of blood.<p>The hope set before us - The hope of eternal life offered in the gospel. This is set before us as our refuge, and to this we flee when we feel that we are in danger of death.

God's counsel and oath, which never change and alter, and from which he never varies: <p>in which it was impossible for God to lie; fail or deceive, nor, indeed, in anything else, besides his counsels, promises, and oath, see <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a><p>we might have a strong consolation; the saints often stand in need of consolation, by reason of sin, Satan, and the world; and it is the will of God that they should be comforted; and he would have them have <p>strong consolation; that which is solid and an abundance of it; and this much depends on the immutability of God's counsel and oath:  <p>who have fled for refuge; either in allusion to mariners, as some think; who make all the haste they can to their port and haven, and are glad when they arrive there, and there cast anchor; of which mention is made in the next verse: or to runners in a race, who make up to the mark, in order to lay hold on the prize; hence Christ is afterwards spoken of as a forerunner: or rather to such as fled to the cities of refuge, which were a type of Christ; the names of these cities were, Kedesh, Shechem, Hebron, Bezer, Romath, and Golan; <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a> and the situation of them, according to the Jews (s), was like two rows in a vineyard. Hebron in Judah was over against Bezer in the wilderness; Shechem in Mount Ephraim was over against Ramoth in Gilead; Kedesh in Mount Naphtali was over against Golan in Bashan: the names of these several cities agree with Christ; Kedesh signifies "holy", as Christ is, both as God and man, and is made sanctification to his people; Shechem is "the shoulder", and Christ has not only bore the sins of his people in his own body, on the tree, but he bears and carries their persons, and has the government of them on his shoulders, where they are safe and secure; Hebron may be interpreted "fellowship", and the saints have not only fellowship with Christ; but with the Father through him; Bezer may be rendered a "fortified place"; Christ is a stronghold, a tower, a place of defence, whither the righteous run, and are safe; Ramoth signifies "exaltations"; and may fitly be applied to Christ, who is exalted at God's right hand, and who will exalt those that trust in him in due time: Golan may be translated "manifested"; Christ the Son of God has been manifest in the flesh, to destroy the works of the devil; and he will be revealed from heaven in a glorious manner at the last day: these cities were known to be such; and they were open to all Israelites and proselytes, that killed any person at unawares; and they were open at all times; and the way to them was made plain and large; every year care was taken to make the way good, to remove every hillock, or anything that hindered; if there was a river in the way, to make a bridge over it; and where more ways met, to set up pillars with a hand to them, and these words written on it, , "refuge, refuge"; nor was the road to be less in breadth than thirty two cubits (t); and there was always room in these cities; and whoever fled there was safe; but those that were found without died: thus Christ is known to be a refuge for distressed sinners; and he is open to all that come unto him, and at all times; the way of life and salvation by him is plainly pointed out in the Gospel, and by the ministers of it; who are appointed to direct unto him, and to remove all impediments and discouragements from such who are seeking to him; and though so many have been received and saved by him, still there is room for more; and whoever betake themselves to him are safe, but those that are without him die and perish: so Philo the Jew (u) makes the divine Word, or Logos, to be the chief and most profitable refuge to fly unto, of all the six which he takes notice of; and the Jews have a notion that in the time to come, in the days of the Messiah, three other cities of refuge will be added (w). There is in some things a difference between Christ and these cities of refuge; there were six of these, but there is no other than Christ; the cities of refuge were only for such who shed blood ignorantly, but Christ is a refuge for all sorts of sinners; they were in a kind of exile who fled to them, but in Christ is complete liberty; it was possible that such might die in them, but those that are in Christ never die the second death; and at best those who fled thither were only saved from a temporal death, whereas those who betake themselves to Christ are saved with an everlasting salvation. Now "fleeing" to Christ, implies danger in the persons that flee, as such are in danger, in themselves, of the curse and condemnation of the law, of the wrath of God, and eternal death; it supposes a sense of this danger, which when right comes from the Spirit of God; it shows guilt of conscience, and a consciousness of the insufficiency of other refuges, and a knowledge of Christ; as a suitable one; and is expressive of haste and hearty desire to be there: <p>to lay hold on the hope set before us; by which is meant, not the grace of hope, but either heaven hoped for, or rather Christ the object of hope; who is not only set down at God's right hand, but is set forth in the Gospel and in the ordinances, both by the Spirit of God, and by the ministers of the word; that men may look and go to him, and trust and believe in him, to the saving of their souls; where he is in sight, near at hand, accessible to; the way to him is straightforward; and here he abides: and he is set before us to be laid hold upon, which intends an act of faith; which grace lays hold on the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ; and is done in a view of fulness and safety in him, and under a sense of danger otherwise; it supposes grace, and that in exercise and somewhat strong; and some degree of resolution and courage of faith, and the steadfastness and continuance of it; the soul determining, if it perishes it will perish here; and it shows that Christ and his grace are to be touched and laid hold upon by faith. <p>(s) T.

To interpret <span class="greekheb">κρατῆσαι</span> as “to lay hold” (Wolf, Tholuck, de Wette, Alford, Kurtz, Ewald, <span class="ital">al</span>.), with a right combining with <span class="greekheb">παράκλησιν</span>, is forbidden by the connection; comp. <a href="/hebrews/6-11.htm" title="And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:">Hebrews 6:11</a>, according to which the readers already possess the <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span>, but not as yet any <span class="greekheb">πληροφορία</span> thereof; comp. further the <span class="greekheb">διὰ μακροθυμίας</span>, <a href="/hebrews/6-12.htm" title="That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.">Hebrews 6:12</a>, and <span class="greekheb">μακροθυμήσας</span>, <a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm" title="And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.">Hebrews 6:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς προκειμένης ἐλπίδος</span> is not the same thing as <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐλπίδος τῶν προκειμένων</span>, “to the hope of the blessings of salvation which lie before us, which await us” (Bleek, de Wette, Tholuck, Maier), in such wise that a mingling of the objective notion of <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span> with the subjective notion thereof would have to be assumed. Still less are we at liberty, with Grotius, Seb. Schmidt, Wittich, Peirce, Limborch, Heinrichs, Böhme, Kuinoel, Klee, Bloomfield, Alford, Hofmann, and others, to interpret <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span> in itself alone as “res sperata” (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5</a>). On the contrary, <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm" title="Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;">Hebrews 6:19</a> points to the Christian hope in the <span class="ital">subjective</span> sense. As <span class="greekheb">προκειμένη</span>, however, <span class="ital">lying at hand</span>, or existing in readiness, this is characterized, since it is already infused into the Christians, has already been communicated to them as a blessing for possession, with their reception of Christianity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm" title="That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us:">Hebrews 6:18</a>. The motive of this procedure on God’s part has already been indicated in <span class="greekheb">βουλόμενος</span>, but now it is more fully declared. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα διὰ δύο</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίδος</span> “that by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us”. The two immutable things are God’s promise and His oath. It is impossible for God to break His promise, impossible also for him to falsify His oath. Both of these were given that even weak men might have strong encouragement. The emphasis is on <span class="greekheb">ἰσχυρὰν</span>, no ordinary encouragement. Interpreters are divided as to the construction of <span class="greekheb">κρατῆσαι</span>, Œcumenius, Bleek, Lünemann, and others maintaining its dependence on <span class="greekheb">παράκλησιν</span>, encouragement to hold fast the hope; while others, as Beza, Tholuck, Delitzsch, Weiss, construe it with <span class="greekheb">καταφυγόντες</span> as in A.V. “who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope”. If this latter construction be not adopted, <span class="greekheb">καταφυγ</span>. is left undefined and must be taken in an absolute sense, which is unwarranted. It is the word used in the LXX (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-42.htm" title="That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-5.htm" title="As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the helve, and lights on his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee to one of those cities, and live:">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-9.htm" title="These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojournes among them, that whoever kills any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.">Joshua 20:9</a>) for fleeing from the avenger to the asylum of the cities of refuge. So here Christians are represented as fleeing from the threatened danger and laying hold of that which promises safety. <span class="greekheb">κρατῆσαι</span> (aor. of single act) must therefore be rendered “to lay hold of” and not, as in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>, “hold fast”. The former meaning is much more frequent than the latter. <span class="greekheb">τῆς προκειμένης ἐλπίδος</span>, the hope, that is, the object of hope is set before us as the city of refuge was set before the refugee and it is laid hold of by the hope it excites. <span class="greekheb">προκειμ</span>. is used of any object of ambition, “de praemiis laborum ac certaminum” (Wetstein, with examples). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐλπίδα τὴν ἀποκειμένην ὑμῖν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">by two immutable things</span>] Namely, by the <span class="ital">oath</span> and by the <span class="ital">word</span> of God.
