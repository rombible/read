He will not forget or fail to reward the endeavors of his people to promote his glory, and to do good. The meaning here is, that by their kindness in ministering to the wants of the saints, they had given full evidence of true piety. If God should forget that, it would be "unrighteous:<p>(1) because there was a propriety that it should be remembered; and,<p>(2) because it is expressly promised that it shall not fail of reward; <a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>.<p>Your work - Particularly in ministering to the wants of the saints.<p>Labour of love - Deeds of benevolence when there was no hope of recompense, or when love was the motive in doing it.<p>Which ye have showed toward his name - Toward him - for the word "name" is often used to denote the person himself.

It is not possible now to know to what particular acts the apostle refers.

Not that we have any inherent right to claim reward; for (1) a servant has no merit, as he only does that which is his bounden duty; (2) our best performances bear no proportion to what we leave undone; (3) all strength comes from God; but God has promised of His own grace to reward the good works of His people (already accepted through faith in Christ); it is His promise, not our merits, which would make it unrighteous were He not to reward His people's works.

He is just and true, righteous in all his ways and works; there is no unrighteousness nor unfaithfulness in him; and this the apostle makes a reason of his strong persuasion of better things concerning the believing Hebrews; because he was well satisfied of the good work upon them, and he was assured that God was not unrighteous and unfaithful: <p>to forget your work: which is not to be understood of any good work done by them, for these are generally expressed in the plural number; and besides, these, if at all, are designed in the next clause; moreover, external good works, or such as appear to men to be so, are performed by hypocrites; nor can they be said to be better things, at least, not such as men are saved by: men may fall from these; and supposing them intended, the merit of works cannot be established, as is attempted from hence by the Papists; for the apostle could only consider them as fruits, not as causes of salvation; they are imperfect, and cannot justify, and therefore cannot save; they do not go before to procure salvation, but follow after, and, at most, but accompany; and though God does remember and not forget them, this is owing to his grace, and not to their merit; God's righteousness in remembering them regards not a debt of justice, but a point of faithfulness: but this is to be understood of the work of God upon them, called in Scripture a good work, and the work of faith; and is elsewhere joined, as here, with the labour of love; see <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a> and this might be called their work, not because wrought by them, but because it was wrought in them; and the grace that came along with it was exercised by them: now from hence the apostle might be persuaded of better things of them, even such as accompany salvation; since this work is a fruit of everlasting and unchangeable love, and is itself immortal, and the beginning of eternal life; and particularly faith is the effect of electing grace; shall never fail; is the means of the saints' preservation; and is connected with everlasting salvation: it follows, <p>and labour of love, which ye have showed toward his name; the word "labour" is omitted in the Alexandrian copy, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions: this may be understood either of love to God, the name of God being put for himself; who is to be loved for his own sake, on account of the perfections of his nature, as well as for the works of his hands; and which is to be showed for the sake of glorifying him: and this love is laborious; it sets a man to work for God; nor are any works to be regarded but what spring from love to God, and to his name; and from hence the apostle might entertain a good hope of these persons, since their love to God was an effect of God's love to them, is a part of the work of grace, and cannot be lost; all things work together for good to such as love God; and these have a crown of life promised unto them: or else it may be understood of love to the saints, as follows, <p>in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister; in seeking both their temporal and spiritual good; and though all men in general are to be loved, yet especially the saints, who are set apart by God, whose sins are expiated by Christ, and who are sanctified by the Spirit; and love to them being laborious, and appearing in many instances, and this shown for the Lord's sake, for his name's sake, might lead the apostle more strongly to conclude better things of them, even things of a saving nature; since charity or love to the saints is better than gifts, and is the evidence of grace, of passing from death to life, and of being the disciples of Christ; see <a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> For God <i>is</i> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</span><p>(5) He praises them for their charity, by this encouraging them to go forward, and to hold out to the end.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm" title="For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.">Hebrews 6:10</a>.

But since, in any case, the passage <a href="/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;">Hebrews 10:32</a> ff. is to be compared as a real (though not verbal) parallel to the statement <a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm" title="For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.">Hebrews 6:10</a>, and there, in addition to the love displayed, the stedfastness manifested by the readers under persecutions is lauded, it is most natural, with Schlichting, Grotius, and others, to suppose that just to this the general <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἔργου ὑμῶν</span> in our passage also more especially alluded.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀγάπης</span>] has not in itself alone the notion of love “to the brethren,” in such wise that <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ</span> would have to be translated: “for His name” (<a href="/context/matthew/10-41.htm" title="He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward....">Matthew 10:41-42</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-20.htm" title="For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middle of them.">Matthew 18:20</a>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> to His honour (Vulgate: in nomine ejus; Böhme and others: <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ</span>, <a href="/matthew/18-5.htm" title="And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me.">Matthew 18:5</a>). On the contrary, <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἀγάπης</span> acquires its object in the <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ</span>, to be construed in relation to <span class="greekheb">ἧς ἐνεδείξασθε</span> (not to <span class="greekheb">διακονήσαντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., to which Beza was inclined). Thus: <span class="ital">the love which ye have shown to His name</span> (sc. <span class="ital">God’s</span> name, not <span class="ital">Christ’s</span>, Ernesti and others).

But the objective meaning, “completeness,” certainly suits <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a> <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ πλοῦτος τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πληροφορίας τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνέσεως</span> and is not unsuitable in <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>, while the verb <span class="greekheb">πληροφορεῖν</span>, at least in some passages, as <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, has an objective sense. Besides, in the case before us, the one meaning involves the other, for, as Weiss himself says, hope is only then what it ought to be when a full certainty of conviction (eine volle Ueberzeugungsgewissheit) accompanies it. See also Davidson, who says “fulness or full assurance of faith and hope is not anything distinct from faith and hope, lying outside of them and to which they may lead; it is a condition of faith and hope themselves, the perfect condition”. <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τέλους</span> the hope was to be perfect in quality and was also to be continuous “to the end,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, until it had accomplished its work and brought them to the enjoyment of what was hoped for.

It was to the poor saints at Jerusalem that the ministry of beneficence was afforded: it was the brethren in Greece and Asia who afforded it. See the passages quoted.

It appears that the Hebrew Christians had formerly (some especial occasion being probably referred to) been active in their charity towards fellow-Christians in distress, and that such charity had not ceased. On this is grounded the persuasion that they will be kept steadfast in the faith. Those who had so shown their faith by their works would surely not be allowed to lose it. The very idea of the Divine justice implies that the use of grace, thus evidenced, will be rewarded by continuance of grace. Cf. <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perfect it (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) until the day of Jesus Christ; "where also there is reference to deeds of charity, shown in the case of the Philippians by their sympathy with the apostle in his bonds, which charity he prays may "abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment." No difficulty need be felt in this reference to God's justice, as though it involved the doctrine of human merit, <span class="accented">de congruo</span> or <span class="accented">de condigno</span>, claiming reward as of debt. The simple and obvious view, that God, in virtue of his justice, will be most gracious to those who have used his grace, by no means contravenes the doctrine of all grace being the free gift of his bounty (cf. <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, etc.). Observe, too, as bearing on the idea of this passage, how the will to <span class="accented">do</span> the will of God is said by our Lord to be followed by knowledge of the <span class="accented">doctrine</span> (<a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>), and how works of charity are the very tests of the final judgment (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He is encouraged in this confidence by the fact that they are still as formerly engaged in Christian ministries.<p>Your work and labor of love (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>Omit labor.
