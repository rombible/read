Hope has its degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has made to believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between the eternal Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely be depended upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, the counsel and the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God to lie; it would be contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And as He cannot lie; the destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation of the believer, are alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God has given full security of happiness, have a title to the promises by inheritance. The consolations of God are strong enough to support his people under their heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinners who flee to the mercy of God, through the redemption of Christ, according to the covenant of grace, laying aside all other confidences. We are in this world as a ship at sea, tossed up and down, and in danger of being cast away. We need an anchor to keep us sure and steady. Gospel hope is our anchor in the storms of this world. It is sure and stedfast, or it could not keep us so. The free grace of God, the merits and mediation of Christ, and the powerful influences of his Spirit, are the grounds of this hope, and so it is a stedfast hope. Christ is the object and ground of the believer's hope. Let us therefore set our affections on things above, and wait patiently for his appearance, when we shall certainly appear with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For men verily swear by the greater - That is, they appeal to God. They never swear by one who is inferior to themselves. The object of the apostle in this declaration is to show that as far as this could be done it had been by God. He could not indeed swear by one greater than himself, but he could make his promise as certain as an oath taken by people was when they solemnly appealed to him. He could appeal to his own existence and veracity, which was at any time the most solemn form of an oath, and thus put the mind to rest in regard to the hope of heaven.<p>And an oath for confirmation - An oath taken to confirm or establish anything.<p>Is to them an end of all strife - That is, when two parties are at variance, or have a cause at issue, an oath binds them to adhere to the terms of agreement concluded on, or contracting parties bind themselves by a solemn oath to adhere to the conditions of an agreement, and this puts an end to all strife. They rest satisfied when a solemn oath has been taken, and they feel assured that the agreement will be complied with. Or it may refer to cases where a man was accused of wrong before a court, and where he took a solemn oath that the thing had not been done, and his oath was admitted to be sufficient to put an end to the controversy. The general meaning is clear, that in disputes between man and man, an appeal was made to an oath, and that was allowed to settle it. The connection here is, that as far as the case would admit of, the same thing was done by God. His oath by himself made his promise firm. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. for confirmation&#8212;not to be joined, as English Version, to "an oath"; but to "an end" [Alford]. I prefer, "The oath is to them, in respect to confirmation (of one's solemn promise or covenant; as here, God's), an end of all contradiction (so the Greek is translated, Heb 12:3), or "gainsaying."

That since men’s oaths procure credit, and put an end to doubts, strife, and contradiction amongst them; much more should God’s oath put an end to doubts and gainsayings of creatures, and make them to give faith to him: men are not inventors and authors of this ordinance of swearing, but subject to God’s precept requiring this from them, and in this special part of God’s worship instituted by him, they ought to swear justly and according to his will; and swear they must by God only, who knows the intentions and secrets of the heart, and who is absolutely greater than all; the omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, and sovereign Lord of all persons, who knows false swearers, and inflicts on them not only temporal but eternal punishments.

These words contain a reason why God swore by himself, and why his promises, having an oath annexed to them, ought to be believed. Men when they swear, they swear by the greater; not by themselves, as God does, because there is one greater than they; not by any of the creatures on earth, nor by the angels in heaven, but by God; because he is the God of truth, the searcher of hearts, and who can take vengeance on perjurers: and an oath may lawfully be taken, when it is truth that is sworn to, and is just and good; and in cases of weight and moment; and in what is possible and right to perform; and when it is done with deliberation, in the fear of God, with a view to his glory, and the good of men: for an oath is of a moral nature, what God has commanded, and he himself has taken; it has been used by Christ, and by the saints of the Old and New Testament; and is prophesied of the New Testament saints, as what they should practise; and is a part of religious worship: <p>and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife; it is used to confirm things that are doubtful, and in dispute; and to put an end to strife and contention; so Philo (o) the Jew says, <p>"by an oath things doubtful are determined, and things uncertain are confirmed, and what were not believed receive credit.'' <p>The manner in which an oath was taken among the Jews, to which, the apostle writing to such, must be thought to have respect, was this; <p>"he that swore took the book of the law in his hand, and he stood and swore by the name (of God), or by his surnames; and the judges did not suffer anyone to swear but in the holy tongue; and thus he said, behold I swear by the God of Israel, by him whose name is merciful and gracious, that I do not owe this man anything (p).'' <p>The Hebrew word  used for an oath, is of the root  which signifies to "fill, satiate, satisfy": for an oath being taken about matters in controversy, not clear but doubtful give content unto and satisfy the minds of men; and the same word also signifies "seven", a number of fulness and perfection; an oath being for the perfecting and finishing an affair in debate; agreeably, when covenants were made by oaths, seven witnesses were used, <a href="/genesis/21-28.htm">Genesis 21:28</a> and Herodotus says (q) as Cocceius (r) observes, that the Arabians, when they swore at making covenants, anointed the stones with blood. <p>(o) De Somniis, p. 567.

For, since the promise imparted to Abraham, in so far as it respected the blessing of all nations by means of his seed, could receive its fulfilment only in conditioning connection with Christ, the Saviour of all believers, the Christians are thus the heirs of the Abrahamic covenant; so also by the oath of God there is guaranteed to them, no less than to Abraham, an indefeasible claim to the object of promise.

Besides, <span class="greekheb">εἰς βεβαίωσιν</span> is more congruous with this meaning. The meaning is that when one man disputes the assertion of another, an oath puts an end to the contradiction and serves for confirmation. So Davidson, Westcott, Weiss, etc. <span class="greekheb">πάσης</span> is added not to indicate the universal deference paid to the oath (Bleek), but the completeness of its effect; no room is left for contradiction. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὅρκος</span> the generic article, best translated “an oath”. <span class="greekheb">f1πέρας</span> an end or limit, as in <a href="/psalms/119-96.htm" title="I have seen an end of all perfection: but your commandment is exceeding broad.">Psalm 119:96</a>, <span class="greekheb">πάσης συντελείας εἶδον πέρας</span>; and <a href="/psalms/145-3.htm" title="Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.">Psalm 145:3</a> <span class="greekheb">τῆς μεγαλωσύνης αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔστι πέρας</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς βεβαίωσιν</span> almost in the technical sense of a guarantee. See Deissmann’s interesting treatment of the word in <span class="ital">Bibelstud.</span>, pp. 100–104. On the verse Calvin remarks: “hic locus docet aliquem inter Christianos jurisjurandi usum esse legitimum. Quod observandum est contra homines fanaticos qui regulam sancte jurandi, quam Deus lege sua praescripsit, libenter abrogarent.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">men verily swear by the greater</span>] <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm" title="Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land wherein you have sojourned.">Genesis 21:23</a>; <a href="/genesis/24-3.htm" title="And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:">Genesis 24:3</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/26-30.htm" title="And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink....">Genesis 26:30-31</a>.

Here begins the explanation of the meaning and purpose of the Divine oath, already cursorily touched on in ver. 13. God thus, for full assurance, condescends to the form of confirmation most binding among men when they promise to each other. <span class="accented">They</span> appeal to one greater than themselves to intervene between <span class="accented">them. He</span>, having no one greater than himself to appeal to, appeals (so to speak) to his own immutability, and thus may be said to <span class="accented">intervene</span> with an oath (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;</span> ever. 17), the verb being neuter, with the sense of "mediate" or "intervene," not, as in A.V., "confirmed it". The reason is not that the Divine promise is not in itself enough, but that <span class="cmt_word">God, willing to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel</span>, is pleased to grant them this additional confirmation; that by two immutable things (first the promise, in itself sufficient; and secondly the oath, for more abundant <span class="accented">assurance</span>), in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong consolation (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, bearing elsewhere this sense, and also that of <span class="accented">exhortation</span>, as in <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-22.htm">Hebrews 13:22</a>; which latter sense is understood here by most commentators as uniting best the drift of the passage with the general notion of encouragement) who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. The course of thought has now passed again from Abraham to Christians, the transition having been prepared for by the general expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 17. Indeed, the oath to him was an assurance to us also, we being the final inheritors of the promised blessing. Then finally, in the two concluding verses, the subject to be treated in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>. is again beautifully led up to by a natural sequence of thought: Which (<span class="accented">so.</span> hope) we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entering into that which is within the veil; whither as a Forerunner Jesus entered for us, become a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. Our hope (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), regarded in ver. 18 objectively, assumes here a subjective sense: it is our anchor east upwards beyond the heavens through which our Forerunner has passed (cf. <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), and, in virtue of the promise and the oath, fixed there secure and firm. "That which is within the <span class="accented">veil"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the word invariably denoting the veil in the temple, is the heavenly holy of holies, of which the earthly was symbolical, as is fully set forth in <a href="/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8</a>. This first mention of the veil is an instance of the manner in which, throughout this Epistle, ideas to be afterwards expanded are often intimated by way of preparation beforehand. Instructive in this chapter is the view presented of Divine purpose in relation to human will. The Divine purpose may have been evinced by supplies of grace so abundant as to remove all doubt of the possibility of success; yet through the human will there may be failure: the very Divine oath may have ensured fulfillment of the promise; yet, as to Abraham, so to individual Christians, faith and patience are the conditions of fulfillment. It is evident that the Divine purpose and the Divine promise are all along referred to, not to dishearten any for fear that they may not be included in them, not to encourage remissness in any on the ground of certainty of attainment, not so as to suggest any idea of arbitrary selection irrespective of desert, but simply to incite to perseverance on the ground of assurance of success, if the human conditions are fulfilled. And this is the practical application of the doctrine of predestination found also elsewhere in St. Paul's Epistles (cf. <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>). Predestination and free-will may be to human reason theoretically irreconcilable, though reason, as well as theology, may compel us to acknowledge both. The problem may properly be left unsolved, as among the many deep things of God. But it is of importance to observe how the doctrine of-predestination is practically applied in Scripture as bearing upon human conduct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>For "an oath," rend.
