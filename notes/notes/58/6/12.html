But the participle, <span class="greekheb">κληρονομουντων</span>, being in the present tense, will hardly bear to be so rendered, signifying literally, <span class="ital">are inheriting, </span>namely, the promises. Pierce and Macknight, therefore, understand it of the believing Gentiles, who at the time when the apostle wrote were inheriting those promises made to Abraham concerning all nations of the earth being blessed in him and his seed. But, as Dr. Doddridge observes, if this were intended as a hint to stir up the Jews to emulation, as is supposed, “it was indeed a very obscure one; for, comparatively, it is a low sense in which Christians, in this imperfect state, can be said to inherit the promises. It seems rather to refer to all good men, who were departed out of our world, whether in former or latter days, and under whatever dispensation they died. Taking it in this view, it is a conclusive argument against the soul’s continuing in a state of sleep during the intermediate period between death and the resurrection.” This certainly seems the most natural interpretation of the verse, namely, that “the apostle meant to lead his readers to meditate on the happiness of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Job, and all those who had on earth lived by faith in the promises of God, especially the great promise of a Saviour, and eternal salvation by him; and had patiently waited, laboured, and suffered in the obedience of faith; and in consequence were at the time, when the apostle wrote this, inheriting the promises of God, of eternal blessings, through Christ, to all believers.” — Scott.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-20 The hope here meant, is a sure looking for good things promised, through those promises, with love, desire, and valuing of them. Hope has its degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has made to believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between the eternal Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely be depended upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, the counsel and the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God to lie; it would be contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And as He cannot lie; the destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation of the believer, are alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God has given full security of happiness, have a title to the promises by inheritance. The consolations of God are strong enough to support his people under their heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinners who flee to the mercy of God, through the redemption of Christ, according to the covenant of grace, laying aside all other confidences. We are in this world as a ship at sea, tossed up and down, and in danger of being cast away. We need an anchor to keep us sure and steady. Gospel hope is our anchor in the storms of this world. It is sure and stedfast, or it could not keep us so. The free grace of God, the merits and mediation of Christ, and the powerful influences of his Spirit, are the grounds of this hope, and so it is a stedfast hope. Christ is the object and ground of the believer's hope. Let us therefore set our affections on things above, and wait patiently for his appearance, when we shall certainly appear with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That ye be not slothful - Indolent; inactive.

This interpretation, however, to which they were without any necessity led by the consideration of <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm" title="For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,">Hebrews 6:13</a>, is untenable. For, in order to harmonize with it in its first-named form, the writing of <span class="greekheb">κληρονομησάντων</span> would have been necessary,—for which, accordingly, many will have the participle present to be taken; to harmonize with it in its last-named form, the writing of <span class="greekheb">κληρονομησάντων τε καὶ κληρονομούντων</span> would have been required. The characterizing <span class="greekheb">οἱ διὰ πίστεως καὶ μακροθυμίας κληρονομοῦντες τὰς ἐπαγγελίας</span> is, on the contrary, quite a general one, and the participle <span class="ital">present</span> marks out that which assuredly takes place, or in accordance with a constant and fixed rule (as a rewarding of the fulfilled preliminary condition of <span class="greekheb">πίστις καὶ μακροθυμία</span>). The thought is therefore, not that the readers should take the patriarchs as a model, but in general that they should take as such those who manifest persevering constancy in the faith, and, on that very account, beyond doubt attain to the possession of that which is promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/6-12.htm" title="That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.">Hebrews 6:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ νωθροὶ γένησθε</span>: “that ye become not sluggish,” “be not, misses the fine delicacy of the writer” (Alford). “The <span class="greekheb">γένησθε</span>, pointing to the future, stands in no contradiction with <span class="greekheb">γεγόνατε</span> at <a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11</a>. There, the sluggishness of the intellect was spoken of; here, it is sluggishness in the retaining of the Christian hope” (Lünemann). Sluggishness would result if they did not “manifest diligence”. <span class="greekheb">μιμηταὶ δὲ τῶν</span> …: “but imitators of those who, through faith and patient waiting, are now inheriting the promises”. The positive aspect of the conduct that should accompany cultivation of hope. They were not the first who had launched into that apparently shoreless ocean. Others before them had crossed it, and found solid land on the other side. There are many who are fairly described as <span class="greekheb">κληρον</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἐπαγγελίας</span>. Whether alive or now dead, they have entered on possession of that good thing which they could not see but which God had promised. Alford, apparently following Peirce, denies that <span class="greekheb">κληρονομούντων</span> can mean “who are inheriting,” and renders “who are inheritors”. To this conclusion he is led, as also Peirce, by the consideration that in c. xi. it is said of Abraham and the other heroes of faith that they did not receive the promise. But it is also indicated in the same passage that by the coming of Christ the fulness of the promise was fulfilled. It was only “without us” of the Christian period that the patriarchs were imperfect. Those who are presently enjoying the promises attained their present victory and joy, <span class="greekheb">διὰ πίστεως καὶ μακροθυμίας</span>. Necessarily, they first had to believe the promises, but faith had to be followed up by patient waiting. Alford translates <span class="greekheb">μακροθ</span>. by “endurance,” but this word rather represents <span class="greekheb">ὑπομονή</span>, while <span class="greekheb">μακροθ</span>. indicates the long-drawn-out patience which is demanded by hope deferred.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">that ye be not slothful</span>] Rather, “that ye <span class="ital">become</span> not slothful” in the advance of Christian hope as you already are (<a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11</a>) in acquiring spiritual knowledge.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">followers</span>] Rather, “imitators,” as in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="Why I beseech you, be you followers of me.">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm" title="Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;">Ephesians 5:1</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through faith and patience inherit the promises</span>] See <a href="/hebrews/6-15.htm" title="And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.">Hebrews 6:15</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>; <a href="/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a>.
