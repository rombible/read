also because (1) the assurance given to him was confirmed by oath; and (2) in it lay included the promise of the Christ. The promises made to Abraham were essentially one, with various parts progressively fulfilled. It seems likely that, though the next verse is quoted from <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>, the writer also has in mind (“<span class= "ital">had</span> promised”) <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>, and especially Genesis 15.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/hebrews/6-13.htm" title="For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,...">Hebrews 6:13-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">For when God made promise, </span>&c. — As if he had said, And it appears that this is the way to partake of mercies promised, because Abraham was obliged to exercise faith and long-suffering before he obtained the accomplishment of the promise made to him. The promise here referred to, is that which God made to Abraham after he had laid Isaac on the altar, <a href="/context/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:...">Genesis 22:16-17</a>. For on no other occasion did God confirm any promise to Abraham with an oath. <span class="ital">To Abraham </span>— Whose spiritual as well as natural seed you believing Hebrews are, and therefore shall partake of the same promises and blessings which were ensured to him. <span class="ital">Because he could swear by no greater </span>person, <span class="ital">he sware by himself </span>— By his own sacred and divine name; <span class="ital">saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee — </span>And all believers in thee; <span class="ital">and multiplying I will multiply thee </span>— Both thy natural and thy spiritual seed. The apostle quotes only the first words of the oath; but his reasoning is founded on the whole; and particularly on the promise, (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm" title="And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.">Genesis 22:18</a>,) <span class="ital">And in thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. </span>They shall be blessed by having their faith counted to them for righteousness, through thy seed, Christ. <span class="ital">And so after he had patiently endured </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μακροθυμησας</span>, <span class="ital">after he had waited, </span>or <span class="ital">suffered long: </span>he waited about thirty years before Isaac was born, after he was promised; <span class="ital">he obtained the promise </span>— Here, by a usual figure of speech, the promise is put for the thing promised. “In the birth of Isaac, Abraham obtained the beginning of the accomplishment of God’s promise concerning his numerous natural progeny. Moreover, as the birth of Isaac was brought about supernaturally by the divine power, it was both a proof and a pledge of the accomplishment of the promise concerning the birth of his numerous spiritual seed. Wherefore, in the birth of Isaac, Abraham may truly be said to have obtained the accomplishment of the promise concerning his numerous spiritual seed likewise. In any other sense, Abraham did not obtain the accomplishment of that promise.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-20 The hope here meant, is a sure looking for good things promised, through those promises, with love, desire, and valuing of them. Hope has its degrees, as faith also. The promise of blessedness God has made to believers, is from God's eternal purpose, settled between the eternal Father, Son, and Spirit. These promises of God may safely be depended upon; for here we have two things which cannot change, the counsel and the oath of God, in which it is not possible for God to lie; it would be contrary to his nature as well as to his will. And as He cannot lie; the destruction of the unbeliever, and the salvation of the believer, are alike certain. Here observe, those to whom God has given full security of happiness, have a title to the promises by inheritance. The consolations of God are strong enough to support his people under their heaviest trials. Here is a refuge for all sinners who flee to the mercy of God, through the redemption of Christ, according to the covenant of grace, laying aside all other confidences. We are in this world as a ship at sea, tossed up and down, and in danger of being cast away. We need an anchor to keep us sure and steady. Gospel hope is our anchor in the storms of this world. It is sure and stedfast, or it could not keep us so. The free grace of God, the merits and mediation of Christ, and the powerful influences of his Spirit, are the grounds of this hope, and so it is a stedfast hope. Christ is the object and ground of the believer's hope. Let us therefore set our affections on things above, and wait patiently for his appearance, when we shall certainly appear with him in glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For when God made promise to Abraham - That he would bless him, and multiply his seed as the stars of heaven; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-17</a>. The object of introducing this example here is, to encourage those to whom the apostle was writing to persevere in the Christian life, This he does by showing that God had given the highest possible assurance of his purpose to bless his people, by an oath. Reference is made to Abraham in this argument, probably, for two reasons:<p>(1) To show the nature of the evidence which Christians have that they will be saved, or the ground of encouragement - being the same as that made to Abraham, and depending, as in his case, on the promise of God; and,<p>(2) because the "example" of Abraham was just in point. He had persevered. He had relied firmly and solely on the promise of God. He did this when appearances were much against the fulfillment of the promise, and he thus showed the advantage of perseverance and fidelity in the cause of God.<p>Because he could swear by no greater - There is no being greater than God. In taking an oath among people it is always implied that the appeal is to one of superior power, who is able to punish for its infraction. But this could not occur in the case of God himself. There was no greater being than himself, and the oath, therefore, was by his own existence.<p>He sware by himself - <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>. "By myself have I sworn;" compare <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>. In an oath of this kind God pledges his veracity; declares that the event shall be as certain as his existence; and secures it by all the perfections of his nature. The usual form of the oath is, "As I live, saith the Lord;" see <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

He (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>), as is the case with you (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.), was assured of his inheritance by the Divine oath; and so he obtained it, but only through "faith and patience." You have the like assurance, but attended with the like conditions. And then this Divine oath, the significance of which is set forth in vers. 16-18, is made a link of connection between the hortatory section (<a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:20</a>) and the coming argument about Melchizedek. This is one instance of the artistic way in which, throughout the Epistle, the interposed hortatory passages are so turned as to connect the divided sections of the argument. But what is said about Abraham (vers. 13, 14, 15) has been variously understood. It is connected with ver. 12 thus: "<span class="accented">Be</span> ye followers of them who inherit the promises through faith and patience: <span class="accented">for</span> God, in his promise to Abraham, swore by himself in confirmation of it; <span class="accented">and so</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>) through patience he obtained the promise. Be it here observed that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 15 ("having patiently endured," A.V.) corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 12, and expresses essentially the same idea. The aorist participle <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> does not in itself imply that the patience was previous to the obtaining; it expresses only that by patiently enduring he obtained. Observe also that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (cf. <a href="/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8</a>; <a href="/acts/27-44.htm">Acts 27:44</a>; <a href="/acts/28-14.htm">Acts 28:14</a>) denotes the <span class="accented">consequence</span> from what has been previously stated; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> followed from the Divine oath ensuring the fulfillment of the promise. Both his eventually obtaining and his patience in awaiting fulfillment were in consequence of the assuring oath. But then how and when did Abraham himself obtain the promise? Not even the temporal fulfillment in the multiplication of his seed and the inheritance of the Promised Land, much less the spiritual fulfillment in Christ, was during his own life. Both he could but see "afar <span class="accented">off."</span> In respect to the latter it is expressly said (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13, 39</a>) that the patriarchs did <span class="accented">not</span> receive the promises - <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. What, then, is meant by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>? Bleek understands the time of the oath (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.), when the promise was irrevocably assured, to have been the time of obtaining. But more than this is suggested by the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 11:33), as well as by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, viz. the actual attainment of the blessing assured to him by oath. There are two other ways of explaining: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to identify Abraham with his seed, in whom, though not in his own person, he may be conceived to have obtained, - of which view it may be significant that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> of the LXX. (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) is changed in the Epistle to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to regard Abraham, still alive in the unseen world, as himself enjoying the fulfillment of the ancient promise. So Delitzsch, who, dwelling on the thought that nothing less than the blessing of Abraham extended to the whole world (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a>) can be regarded as complete fulfill-merit, says, "God's oath-sealed word of promise is now fulfilled in Christ, and Abraham, while living on in the unseen world, is conscious of and enjoys that fulfillment, and so may be said to have "obtained the promise." This view derives some support from <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>, where the longings of the pilgrim patriarchs is so beautifully represented as reaching to a heavenly fulfillment. On the other hand, the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> is against it, and hence view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> may be accepted as a sufficient explanation of the expression (see below, or <a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>). With regard to the general drift, it is obvious how <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in respect to the promise first made to him "in Charran," is strikingly displayed in Abraham's recorded life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Illustration of the long-suffering of faith by the example of Abraham. The necessity for emphasizing this element of faith lay in the growing discouragement of the Jewish Christians at the long delay of Christ's second coming. Comp. ch. 11. Abraham became a sojourner in the land of the promise, looking for the heavenly city (<a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>, <a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>). All the instances cited in that chapter illustrate the long outlook of faith, involving patient waiting and endurance. The example of Abraham shows, first, that the promise of God is sure.<p>Because he could swear by no greater (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;' &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit. since he had (the power) to swear by no one greater.<p>By himself (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;' &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Comp. <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>.
