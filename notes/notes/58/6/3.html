We should not be always speaking about outward things; these have their places and use, but often take up too much attention and time, which might be better employed. The humbled sinner who pleads guilty, and cries for mercy, can have no ground from this passage to be discouraged, whatever his conscience may accuse him of. Nor does it prove that any one who is made a new creature in Christ, ever becomes a final apostate from him. The apostle is not speaking of the falling away of mere professors, never convinced or influenced by the gospel. Such have nothing to fall away from, but an empty name, or hypocritical profession. Neither is he speaking of partial declinings or backslidings. Nor are such sins meant, as Christians fall into through the strength of temptations, or the power of some worldly or fleshly lust. But the falling away here mentioned, is an open and avowed renouncing of Christ, from enmity of heart against him, his cause, and people, by men approving in their minds the deeds of his murderers, and all this after they have received the knowledge of the truth, and tasted some of its comforts. Of these it is said, that it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance. Not because the blood of Christ is not sufficient to obtain pardon for this sin; but this sin, in its very nature, is opposite to repentance and every thing that leads to it. If those who through mistaken views of this passage, as well as of their own case, fear that there is no mercy for them, would attend to the account given of the nature of this sin, that it is a total and a willing renouncing of Christ, and his cause, and joining with his enemies, it would relieve them from wrong fears. We should ourselves beware, and caution others, of every approach near to a gulf so awful as apostacy; yet in doing this we should keep close to the word of God, and be careful not to wound and terrify the weak, or discourage the fallen and penitent. Believers not only taste of the word of God, but they drink it in. And this fruitful field or garden receives the blessing. But the merely nominal Christian, continuing unfruitful under the means of grace, or producing nothing but deceit and selfishness, was near the awful state above described; and everlasting misery was the end reserved for him. Let us watch with humble caution and prayer as to ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And this will we do - We will make these advances toward a higher state of knowledge and piety. Paul had confidence that they would do it (see <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/6-9.htm">Hebrews 6:9-10</a>), and though they had lingered long around the elements of Christian knowledge, he believed that they would yet go on to make higher attainments.<p>If God permit - This is not to be interpreted as if God was "unwilling" that they should make such advances, or as if it were "doubtful" whether he would allow it if they made an honest effort, and their lives were spared; but it is a phrase used to denote their "dependence" on him. It is equivalent to saying, "if he would spare their lives, their health, and their reason; if he would continue the means of grace, and would impart his Holy Spirit; if he would favor their efforts and crown them with success, they would make these advances." In reference to anything that we undertake, however pleasing to God in itself, it is proper to recognize our entire dependence on God; see <a href="//biblehub.com/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>; compare the notes on <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. will we do&#8212;So some of the oldest manuscripts read; but others, "Let us do."

It is, or at least should be, the determination of a Gospel minister, to preach Christ, and the great truths of the Gospel; and wheresoever God has called him to it, though there may be many adversaries, and though he may be reproached, calumniated, and deserted: resolution in preaching the Gospel, and adhering to it, is very commendable in a minister; and it is very laudable in hearers to attend to it, stand by it, and search further into it; and which both should determine upon with a regard to the will of God, "if God permit": God's permission is much to be observed in the ministry of the word, in giving gifts to men, in placing them out here and there, where they shall exercise them, in directing them to subjects, and in making their ministry useful and successful: and it may be observed in general, that nothing can be done, or come to pass, good or bad, but what God permits or wills to be done; no good things, no actions, civil, natural, moral, or spiritual; no evil things, the evil of punishment, afflictions, the persecutions of wicked men, the temptations of Satan, heresies, and even immoralities. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And this will we do, if God permit.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/6-3.htm" title="And this will we do, if God permit.">Hebrews 6:3</a>.

For—apart from the unsuitability of the sense resulting, according to which the author would declare his intention of treating the more difficult earlier than the more easy, which latter surely contains the preliminary condition for the understanding of the former—against such <span class="ital">supplementing</span> the fact is decisive, that the <span class="greekheb">μή</span> in connection with <span class="greekheb">καταβαλλόμενοι</span>, <a href="/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>, would be arbitrarily set aside; against the <span class="ital">apprehending in this sense</span>, the fact that for the expression of such a meaning <span class="greekheb">ποιήσομεν δὲ καὶ τοῦτο</span> must have been written.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ θεός</span>] <span class="ital">provided that God permits it</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-7.htm" title="For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>), inasmuch, namely, as all things, even the carrying into effect of good resolutions, are subordinated to the higher decree of God. Incomprehensible, therefore, is the assertion of de Wette, who has therein followed Abresch, that the addition <span class="greekheb">ἐάνπερ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is plainly irreconcilable “with the taking of our verse in the sense of a demand.” For the supposition, that in this case “the encouraging belief in God’s gracious assistance” must be expressed, is an altogether erroneous assumption, since the author in the present passage is by no means aiming at the consolation of the readers, but, on the contrary—as is shown by <a href="/context/hebrews/6-4.htm" title="For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,...">Hebrews 6:4-8</a>—at the alarming of them.

The writer, feeling as he does the arduous nature of the task he undertakes, adds the condition, <span class="greekheb">ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ Θεός</span>, “if God permit”. The addition of <span class="greekheb">περ</span> has the effect of limiting the condition or of indicating a <span class="ital">sine qua non</span>; and may be rendered “if only,” “if at all events,” “if at least”.
