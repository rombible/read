and by reason of this He is the Mediator of a covenant, a new covenant, in order that they who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.” For “the new testament” we must certainly read <span class= "ital">a new covenant:</span> whatever may be thought of the following group of verses, the rendering <span class= "ital">testament</span> has no place here. The leading thought of Hebrews 8 is the establishment of a new covenant, and the former covenant has been referred to three times in this very chapter (<a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That by means of death.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">that, death having taken place for redemption from the transgressions, &c.</span> The first covenant had been broken by “transgressions:” unless there be redemption from these—that is, from the bondage of penalty which has resulted from these—there can be no promise and no new covenant. In respect of this bondage, this penalty, the death of Christ was a ransom—an offering to God looked at in the light of a payment in the place of debt, service, or penalty due. When debt and payment are changed into the corresponding ideas of sin and punishment, the <span class= "ital">ransom</span> gives place to the <span class= "ital">sin-offering, </span>of which the principle was the acknowledgment of death deserved, and the vicarious suffering of death. So far our thought has rested on the removal of the results of the past. The covenant and the promise relate to the establishment of the better future. Death was necessary alike for both. The offering of Christ’s life (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>) was a ransom or an offering for sin; it was also a sacrifice inaugurating a new covenant, which contained the promise of the eternal inheritance. See <a href="/context/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16-18</a>; also <a href="/context/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13-14</a>, where the thought is very similar.<p><span class= "bld">They which are called.</span>—More clearly, <span class= "ital">they that have been called.</span> (See <a href="/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>; <a href="/context/romans/1-6.htm" title="Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:">Romans 1:6-7</a>; <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2Thessalonians 2:13-14</a>.)

For through it we receive the blessings which Christ, by his will, designed for, and declared should be conferred upon believers through faith in his blood. “Thus when he said, <span class="ital">for their sakes I sanctify myself, </span><a href="/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>; that is, I offer up myself as a piacular victim, that <span class="ital">they might be sanctified, </span>or truly purged from their sins; he adds, as his last will and testament, <span class="ital">Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me be with me where I am. </span>So here he is become a <span class="ital">high-priest of good things </span>to come, purchasing eternal redemption for us by his blood: and the <span class="ital">mediator </span>of that <span class="ital">new covenant, </span>in which God promises <span class="ital">to be merciful to our transgressions, and to remember our sins no more, </span><a href="/hebrews/8-12.htm" title="For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.">Hebrews 8:12</a>; procuring the remission of them by the intervention of his death, that they who believe in him might receive <span class="ital">the promise of an eternal inheritance </span>— Which he died to entitle them to, and confer upon them; whence it is styled <span class="ital">the purchased possession, </span><a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>. This therefore was <span class="ital">his will and testament, </span>that they, for whom he died, should <span class="ital">live through him. </span>And this testament could not be confirmed but by his death: he, therefore, was at once the <span class="ital">mediator </span>in whom the <span class="ital">new covenant, </span>promising to us remission of sins, was made, and the <span class="ital">testator </span>by whose death the testament, that they who believed in him <span class="ital">should have eternal life, </span>was ratified.” So Dr. Whitby, who, however, observes, that the paragraph, to the end of <a href="/hebrews/9-20.htm" title="Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined to you.">Hebrews 9:20</a>, will admit of a fair interpretation without supposing that any thing is said in it either of a <span class="ital">testament </span>or <span class="ital">testator. </span>See on the next verse. <span class="ital">That by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions </span>— That is, for the redemption of transgressors from the guilt and punishment of those sins which were committed under the first covenant. In other words, He suffered for this end, that he might procure deliverance, not only from the condemnation due to the sins which have been committed since his death, but from that due to those which were committed during the former dispensation and state of the church, which could not be fully expiated by any of those sacrifices which belonged to the first covenant. <span class="ital">They which are called </span>— And obey the call, or are made partakers of the grace of the gospel; <span class="ital">might receive the promise of eternal inheritance </span>— The things promised in the new covenant, namely, not a temporary, earthly <span class="ital">inheritance, </span>such as the land of Canaan, promised in the first covenant, but that eternal glory which is promised in the new covenant.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:15-22 The solemn transactions between God and man, are sometimes called a covenant, here a testament, which is a willing deed of a person, bestowing legacies on such persons as are described, and it only takes effect upon his death. Thus Christ died, not only to obtain the blessings of salvation for us, but to give power to the disposal of them. All, by sin, were become guilty before God, had forfeited every thing that is good; but God, willing to show the greatness of his mercy, proclaimed a covenant of grace. Nothing could be clean to a sinner, not even his religious duties; except as his guilt was done away by the death of a sacrifice, of value sufficient for that end, and unless he continually depended upon it. May we ascribe all real good works to the same all-procuring cause, and offer our spiritual sacrifices as sprinkled with Christ's blood, and so purified from their defilement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And for this cause - With this view; that is, to make an effectual atonement for sin, and to provide a way by which the troubled conscience may have peace.<p>He is the Mediator - see notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19-20</a>.

The general idea here is, that these were offences for which no expiation could be made by the sacrifices under that dispensation, or from which the blood then shed could not redeem. This general idea may include two particulars.<p>(1) that they who had committed transgressions under that covenant, and who could not be fully pardoned by the imperfect sacrifices then made, would receive a full forgiveness of all their sins in the great day of account through the blood of Christ. Though the blood of bulls and goats could not expiate, yet they offered that blood in faith; they relied on the promised mercy of God; they looked forward to a perfect sacrifice - and now the blood of the great atonement offered as a "full" expiation for all their sins, would be the ground of their acquittal in the last day.<p>(2) that the blood of Christ would now avail for the remission of all those sins which could not be expiated by the sacrifices offered under the Law. It not only contemplated the remission of all the offences committed by the truly pious under that Law, but would now avail to put away sin entirely. No sacrifice which people could offer would avail, but the blood of Christ would remove all that guilt.<p>That they which are called - Alike under the old covenant and the new.<p>Might receive the promise of eternal inheritance - That is, the fulfillment of the promise; or that they might be made partakers of eternal blessings.

At the moment that His death took place, the necessary effect is, "the called receive the (fulfilment of the) promise" (so Lu 24:49 uses "promise"; Heb 6:15; Ac 1:4); that moment divides the Old from the New Testament. The "called" are the elect "heirs," "partakers of the heavenly calling" (Heb 3:1).<p>redemption of &#8230; transgressions &#8230; under &#8230; first testament&#8212;the transgressions of all men from Adam to Christ, first against the primitive revelation, then against the revelations to the patriarchs, then against the law given to Israel, the representative people of the world. The "first testament" thus includes the whole period from Adam to Christ, and not merely that of the covenant with Israel, which was a concentrated representation of the covenant made with (or the first testament given to) mankind by sacrifice, down from the fall to redemption. Before the inheritance by the New Testament (for here the idea of the "INHERITANCE," following as the result of Christ's "death," being introduced, requires the Greek to be translated "testament," as it was before covenant) could come in, there must be redemption of (that is, deliverance from the penalties incurred by) the transgressions committed under the first testament, for the propitiatory sacrifices under the first testament reached only as far as removing outward ceremonial defilement. But in order to obtain the inheritance which is a reality, there must be a real propitiation, since God could not enter into covenant relation with us so long as past sins were unexpiated; Ro 3:24, 25, "a propitiation &#8230; His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past."<p>might&#8212;Greek, "may receive," which previously they could not (Heb 11:39, 40).<p>the promise&#8212;to Abraham.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And for this cause he is the Mediator of the new testament:</span> as Christ’s priesthood and service, his sacrifice and purifying, so the testamental covenant, and his administration of it, did incomparably exceed all those of Aaron’s; so that for what was spoken, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a></span>, even the effects of his sacrifice, the justification and sanctification of sinners, is he the great gospel High Priest, the mediating person between God and sinners, confirming and making effectual by his death God’s testamental covenant to them, which is for the administration of it the very best and last, in which God bequeatheth pardon, reconciliation, righteousness, holiness, adoption, and heirship to an eternal inheritance to penitent, believing sinners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That by means of death; </span> the death of Christ himself, God-man, the most excellent sacrifice, without which there could be no remission, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a></span>, nor the testament of God about it put in force; for which cause he was the Mediator of it, that they should value him so much the more for his death, fulfilling therein all his types, and reach that which was unattainable by these, both for their fathers and themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament; </span> for the satisfying the justice of God for the wrong their sins had done it, paying that price without which they could not be expiated, by which they were remissible, and to the duty qualified, actually forgiven, even the sins of those who were under the Mosaical administration of the covenant. Aaron, Samuel, David, and the saints, believers in that time, had their transgressions pardoned by virtue of the death of Christ to come, shadowed by these sacrifices typifying him and his death in their own times. What the death of beasts or birds could do for them, his did, delivering them from the guilt and punishment of their transgressions, under which otherwise they must have perished for ever: this Peter publisheth, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/15-11.htm" title="But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.">Acts 15:11</a></span>.

This may refer both to what goes before, and what follows after; for Christ, that he might offer himself to God, and by his blood purge the consciences of his people from dead works, that so they might serve the living God, became the Mediator of the New Testament, or covenant; and also he took upon him this character and office, <p>that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance; Christ became the Mediator of the New Testament, and assumed human nature that he might die, and by dying might obtain redemption for his people; not only for those that were then in the world, or should be in it, but also for all those that had been in it. "The first testament" is the first dispensation of the covenant of grace, reaching from the first promulgation of it to Adam after the fall, to the death of Christ; "the transgressions" that were under it are the sins of the saints who lived under that dispensation, froth Adam to Moses, and from Moses to Christ, and takes in all their iniquities of every kind: and the "redemption" of these, or from these, by Christ, at and through his death, does not suppose that there was no remission of sins, or justification from them, under that dispensation; or that the Old Testament saints did not go to heaven, but were detained in a prison, till redeemed by the death of Christ; or that their sins were only redeemed, not their persons; for transgressions may stand for transgressors; and so the Syriac version renders it, "that by his death he might be a redemption for them who transgressed the first testament"; so the Jews say, that the Messiah must die   "to redeem the fathers" (b): but the sense is, that though legal sacrifices could not atone for sin, nor ceremonial ablutions cleanse from them; yet the sins of Old Testament saints were expiated, their iniquities pardoned, and they justified and saved, through the blood of Christ, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world; whose death is a redemption from transgressions past, present, and to come; whose blood is the ransom price for them, and was shed for the remission of them, even of sins that are past through the forbearance of God; who took the surety's word for the performance of all this, which in the fulness of time he strictly fulfilled, to the satisfaction of law and justice; see <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a> and the ultimate end of Christ's being a Mediator, and dying for such purposes, was, that called ones might receive the promised inheritance: by the "eternal inheritance", is meant heaven, which is by gift and bequest, belongs to children only, and comes through the death of Christ; and is a very substantial, plentiful, and glorious one; it is incorruptible and undefiled, and that fades not away, and as here, "eternal"; it was prepared from the foundation of the world, and will continue for ever; and it may be so called, to distinguish it from the inheritance of the land of Canaan, or any temporal one: "the promise" of this was made before the world began, and was put into the hands of Christ, the surety of the better testament, by whose death the heirs of it come to enjoy both the promise, and the thing promised; and they are such who are "called", not merely externally, but internally and effectually; by whom were meant, not Abraham and his natural seed, nor the Old Testament saints only, but all that are called with an holy calling, whether Jews or Gentiles, and who will enjoy both the promise of the inheritance, and that itself, in a way of "receiving": every word shows this affair to be all of grace; it is an "inheritance", and therefore the Father's gift; it is by "promise", and so of grace; and it is "received", and so freely given, and not merited; and only such who are "called" by grace possess it; and yet it is through the death of Christ, that so it might be received in a way consistent with the justice of God. <p>(b) R.

It follows that Christ shed his blood also for the fathers, for he was foreshadowed by these old ceremonies, otherwise, unless they served to represent him, they were not at all profitable.

For the inauguration of the earthly sanctuary the blood of slain animals sufficed; for the consecration of the heavenly sanctuary, on the other hand, there was need of a more excellent sacrifice. This Christ has presented once for all in the end of the world, by His sin-cancelling sacrificial death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ διὰ τοῦτο</span>, “And on this account,” that is to say, because, as stated in <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, Christ’s blood cleanses the conscience from dead works and thus fits men to draw near to God, <span class="greekheb">διαθήκης καινῆς μεσίτης ἐστίν</span>, “He is mediator of a new covenant”. The old covenant with sacrifices which could only cleanse the flesh allowed sins to accumulate. But Christ, as above stated, obtained cleansing from sins, and so laid the essential foundation of a new covenant, <a href="/hebrews/8-12.htm" title="For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.">Hebrews 8:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅπως θανάτου γενομένου</span> … “that a death having taken place for deliverance from the transgressions [committed] under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promised eternal inheritance”.

God being during that period the covenant God of the people, this involved eternal good. But until their transgressions were atoned for they could not receive the inheritance. The sacrifices under the old covenant could not atone for sin, therefore a new covenant with a death which could atone was necessary; in order that such a death having taken place and their sins being removed they might receive fulfilment of the promise. The retrospective reference of the death of Christ is here affirmed; as in <a href="/hebrews/11-40.htm" title="God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.">Hebrews 11:40</a> it is stated that without us, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, without the Christian dispensation, the O.T. believers could not be perfected, The words <span class="greekheb">οἱ κεκλημένοι</span>, therefore, include not only the Hebrews addressed but all who had lived under the O.T. dispensation. <span class="greekheb">ἀπολύτρωοιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">παραβάσεων</span>, the genitive is of the object from which redemption is achieved, and <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span> is scarcely “against” as in Vaughan, but rather “in the time of,” as in <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>, <a href="/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Php 1:3</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15–28</span>.

The verse is a sort of reason why Christ’s death was necessary. The ultimate, <span class="ital">a priori</span>, reason he does not attempt to explain, because it transcends all understanding; but he merely says that since under the Old Covenant <span class="ital">death</span> was necessary, and victims had to be slain in order that by their blood men might be purified, and the High Priest might enter the Holiest Place, so, under the New Covenant, a better and more efficacious death was necessary, both to give to those old sacrifices the only real validity which they possessed, and to secure for all of God’s elect an eternal heritage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διαθήκης καινῆς</span>, <span class="ital">of the new testament</span>) Here the testament is rather urged, than the newness of the testament: comp. <a href="/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">θανάτου γενομένου</span>, <span class="ital">by means of death that took place</span>) that is, at the time when the death had taken place.

For the word is still <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, though here, for reasons that will appear, rendered "testament" in the A.V. The connecting thought here is - It is <span class="accented">because</span> of Christ's sacrifice having been such as has been described, that he is the Mediator of that new and better covenant; it qualified him for being so. A sacrifice, a death, was required for giving it validity (vers. 16-23), and the <span class="accented">character</span> of his sacrifice implies a <span class="accented">better</span> covenant than the old, even such a one as Jeremiah foretold. Further, the purpose of his death is said to be "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant." For in the passage of Jeremiah the defect of the first covenant was based on the transgression of its conditions by man, while under the new one, such transgressions were to be no more remembered. But this could not be without atonement for them; the whole ceremonial of the Law signified this; and also that such atonement could not be except by death. The death of Christ satisfied this requirement; and so the new covenant could come in. So far the course of thought is clear. Nor is there difficulty in understanding the purport of ver. 18, etc., taken by itself, where the "blood-shedding" that inaugurated the first covenant is regarded as typical of that of Christ in the inauguration of the new one. But there is a difficulty about the intervening verses (16, 17), arising from the apparent use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in a new sense, not otherwise suggested - that of <span class="accented">testament</span> rather than <span class="accented">covenant.</span> The verses are, as given in the A.V., <span class="cmt_word">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. a word of which the exact meaning is not clear; some interpret "be brought in, or proved," some "be understood, implied ") <span class="cmt_word">the death of the testator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "him that made it"). <span class="cmt_word">For a testament is of force after men are dead</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth</span> (or, <span class="accented">for doth it ever avail while he theft made it liveth?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>; <a href="/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26</a>; <a href="/luke/3-15.htm">Luke 3:15</a>). Now, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> itself undoubtedly may bear the sense of "testament." Its general meaning is " disposition," or "settlement;" and it may denote either compact between living persons, or a will to take effect after the testator's death. In the verses before us it <span class="accented">appears</span> to be used specifically in the latter sense. For they express general propositions, which are <span class="accented">not</span> true of all covenants, but <span class="accented">are</span> true (according to their most obvious sense) of all testaments. Further, this sense is distinctly applicable to the <span class="accented">new</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, regarded as the dying Christ's bequest to his Church. Hence, but for the context, we should naturally so understand it in these verses. The difficulties attending this sense are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word is not used in this specific sense before or afterwards in this Epistle or in <a href="/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>, which is the basis of the whole argument, or elsewhere, apparently, either in the Old Testament or the New. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sense does not suit the case of the <span class="accented">old</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, which was a covenant between the living God and his people; and there is no intimation of two senses being intended in the two cases: indeed, in the passage before us, the same sense seems to be distinctly implied, since the blood-shedding which inaugurated the old is at once (in ver. 17) spoken of as answering to the death which inaugurated the new, as though death inaugurated both in the same sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The word, in the sense of <span class="accented">covenant</span> (equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span>), is common in the LXX., expressing an idea familiar to Jews and Jewish Christians, while testamentary dispositions were, as far as we know, unfamiliar to the Hebrews; and, though the Roman testamentary law may have come into use when the Epistle was written, it is thought unlikely that the writer, addressing Hebrews, would have referred to it in illustration of a Divine dispensation, or, if he had, have used a word so well known to them in its traditional sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Christ is called (here as well as in <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> and Hebrews 13:20) the <span class="accented">Mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) of the new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>: but a testament does not require a Mediator, nor, if it has one, can the same person be both mediator and testator. If, however, the sense of <span class="accented">testament</span> should seem inevitable here, we may explain as follows. Though the word has been used so far in a general sense, yet the writer, on the suggestion of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in ver. 15, passes in thought at ver. 16 to the specific sense of <span class="accented">testament</span>, as suiting the case of Christ, the language he uses being sufficient for carrying his readers with him in the transition. Further, though the old <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> was not in itself a testament, yet it was typical of that which was; its whole ceremonial foreshadowed the future Testator's death, and so, in a typical sense, it might also itself be called one. Consequently, in ver. 18, the inaugurating sacrifices of the old dispensation are regarded as representing the death of the testator; for they prefigured Christ, through whose death the "eternal inheritance" is bequeathed to man. (In accordance with this view, the Vulgate renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="accented">testamentum</span> throughout the Epistle, even when the old dispensation is referred to.) As to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (translated "the testator"), it <span class="accented">is</span>, according to this view, ultimately God the Father in the new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, as well as in the old, though, of course, the Godhead could not die. But the Father having placed the whole inheritance destined for mankind in the hands of Christ as Mediator, in <span class="accented">his</span> human death the testator died. And thus one of the difficulties above mentioned may be met, viz. that of Christ being regarded both as Testator and Mediator. Christ <span class="accented">was</span>, in fact, both - Testator, in that, being one with God, he bequeathed through his death the kingdom appointed unto hint by the Father; Mediator, in that it was through his incarnation only that the "eternal inheritance" willed to us by the Father could be transmitted in the way of testament. So in effect Chrysostom explains. Apposite to this view of the subject are his own words (<a href="/luke/22-29.htm">Luke 22:29</a>), "And I appoint (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) unto you a kingdom, as my Father appointed (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) unto me." Here we have the same verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) as is used in the Epistle. And though, in the passage from St. Luke, the idea of a <span class="accented">testamentary</span> appointment is not necessarily implied, yet it is naturally suggested where Christ is speaking on the eve of, and with reference to, his death. There is, however, another view taken (decidedly by Whitby, Ebrard, and in the recent 'Speaker's Commentary'), according to which the idea of a <span class="accented">testament</span> does not come in at all, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> retaining here, as elsewhere, its usual sense of <span class="accented">covenant.</span> The position is that, though the propositions of vers. 16, 17 are <span class="accented">not</span> true of all covenants, yet there is a sense in which they <span class="accented">are</span> true of any covenant between God and man; which is the only kind of covenant that the writer has in view, or that his readers would be led to think of by the previous reference to <a href="/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>, or by the associations of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> as used in the Old Testament. The sense in which the propositions are true of such a covenant is thus expressed by Ebrard: "Whenever sinful man will enter into a covenant with the holy God, the man must first die - must first atone for his guilt by death (or must put in a substitute for himself)." This principle is expressed (it is alleged), not only by the sacrifices that inaugurated this covenant of the Law, but also wherever a covenant between God and man is spoken of in the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8</a>, etc., and <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.). In the case of covenants between man and man (as between Abraham and Abimelech, and between Jacob and Laban) there was no need of slain victims, whoso life had to be given for that of one of the contracting parties; but there is always expressed such need in the case of a covenant between God and man. Further, the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, is, according to this view, illustrated by <a href="/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui ordinant testamentum ejus super sacrificiis</span>). The same preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is used in both passages, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is supposed to express the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. This passage from the psalm is certainly much to the point in support of the view before us, serving moreover to meet in some degree one principal objection to it, viz. that it requires <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to be understood of the human party to the covenant, and not of its Divine Author. Such is not the most obvious application of the word, nor the one sanctioned by the quotation from Jeremiah, or by other references to the Divine covenant (see <span class="accented">supra</span>, <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>, and also <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2, 3</a>; <a href="/luke/12-29.htm">Luke 12:29</a>; <a href="/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>; as well as <a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>, quoted below (ver. 20), where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, is the word in the LXX. But such is the application in <a href="/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a>, and may be considered, therefore, not untenable. The writer may, indeed, have had the expression in the psalm in his mind when he wrote the verses before us. It appears from what has been said that difficulties attend both the views that have been above explained. It is not here attempted to decide between them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The efficacy of Christ's sacrifice is bound up with a covenant.
