Thus Christ died, not only to obtain the blessings of salvation for us, but to give power to the disposal of them. All, by sin, were become guilty before God, had forfeited every thing that is good; but God, willing to show the greatness of his mercy, proclaimed a covenant of grace. Nothing could be clean to a sinner, not even his religious duties; except as his guilt was done away by the death of a sacrifice, of value sufficient for that end, and unless he continually depended upon it. May we ascribe all real good works to the same all-procuring cause, and offer our spiritual sacrifices as sprinkled with Christ's blood, and so purified from their defilement.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And almost all things - It is a general custom to purify everything by blood. This rule was not universal, for some things were purified by fire and water, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/31-22.htm">Numbers 31:22-23</a>, and some by water only; <a href="/numbers/31-24.htm">Numbers 31:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-26.htm">Leviticus 16:26</a>, <a href="/leviticus/16-28.htm">Leviticus 16:28</a>. But the exceptions to the general rule were few. Almost everything in the tabernacle and temple service, was consecrated or purified by blood.<p>And without shedding of blood is no remission - Remission or forgiveness of sins. That is, though some things were purified by fire and water, yet when the matter pertained to the forgiveness of sins, it was "universally" true that no sins were pardoned except by the shedding of blood. Some impurities might be removed by water and fire, but the stain of "sin" could be removed only by blood. This declaration referred in its primary meaning, to the Jewish rites, and the sense is, that under that dispensation it was universally true that in order to the forgiveness of sin blood must be shed. But it contains a truth of higher order and importance still. "It is universally true that sin never has been, and never will be forgiven, except in connection with, and in virtue of the shedding of blood." It is on this principle that the plan of salvation by the atonement is based, and on this that God in fact bestows pardon upon people. There is not the slightest evidence that any man has ever been pardoned except through the blood shed for the remission of sins. The infidel who rejects the atonement has no evidence that his sins are pardoned; the man who lives in the neglect of the gospel, though he has abundant evidence that he is a sinner, furnishes none that his sins are forgiven; and the Mussulman and the pagan can point to no proof that their sins are blotted out. It remains to be demonstrated that one single member of the human family has ever had the slightest evidence of pardoned sin, except through the blood of expiation. In the divine arrangement there is no principle better established than this, that all sin which is forgiven is remitted through the blood of the atonement; a principle which has never been departed from hitherto, and which never will be. It follows, therefore:<p>(1) that no sinner can hope for forgiveness except through the blood of Christ;<p>(2) that if people are ever saved they must be willing to rely on the merits of that blood;<p>(3) that all people are on a level in regard to salvation, since all are to be saved in the same way; and,<p>(4) that there will be one and the same song in heaven - the song of redeeming love. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. almost&#8212;to be joined with "all things," namely almost all things under the old dispensation.

The pouring out of the blood on the altar is the main part of the sacrifice (Le 17:11), and it could not have place apart from the previous shedding of the blood in the slaying. Paul has, perhaps, in mind here, Lu 22:20, "This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you."<p>is&#8212;Greek, "takes place": comes to pass.<p>remission&#8212;of sins: a favorite expression of Luke, Paul's companion.

Some join the word almost with the word purged, as if the sense was, that all things were purged by blood, but not perfectly, only almost; but the former sense is best. <p>And without shedding of blood is no remission; that is, of sin; there was no typical remission without it; and there can be no real remission but by, the blood of Christ; no instance can be given of pardon without it; if it could have been otherwise, the blood of Christ had not been shed; for so it would seem to be shed in vain, and his satisfaction to be unnecessary; nor is it agreeable to the justice of God to forgive sin without satisfaction; nor is it consistent with his veracity, and faithfulness to his word, <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>.

Still less is it to be joined to <span class="greekheb">καθαρίζεται</span>, as is done by Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, and Primasius, who, in opposition to the cohesion with that which precedes and follows, will find the thought expressed that the purification accomplished in accordance with the law is only a partial, bodily one, and thus only imperfect, since it is not able to cancel sins.

The sense is consequently: and one must almost say that all things are according to the law purified with blood, and that without the shedding of blood no remission takes place. So, rightly, Bleek, Winer, <span class="ital">Gramm.</span>, 7 Aufl. p. 514 f.; Riehm, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 500; Alford, Maier, Hofmann, and Woerner.

What is meant is not specially the pouring out of the blood upon the altar (de Wette, Hofmann, Schriftbew.

Whether it qualifies both clauses, as Bleek, Weiss and others suppose, is more doubtful. Westcott and Delitzsch confine its reference to the first clause. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αἵματι</span> “with blood” the usual instrumental <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>, all things, especially, of course, those that were used in God’s worship or brought into His tabernacle. Water was used for cleansing from certain pollutions. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸν νόμον</span>, it was not only a contrivance of man but the law of God which enacted that cleansing must be by blood. <span class="greekheb">καὶ χωρὶς αἱματεκχυσίας</span>, “without blood-shedding,” a word which occurs only here in Bibl. Greek. See Stephanus <span class="ital">s.v</span>. In all the instances cited in Stephanus it means the shedding of blood. Rendall, then, is quite wrong in maintaining (after Tholuck and De Wette) that it means, not the shedding but the outpouring of the blood at the foot of the altar. “The essential idea attached to the one act was destruction of life, of the other devotion of the same life to God. Hence the typical significance of the two acts was also quite distinct; outpouring of blood typified in fact, not physical death, but spiritual martyrdom by the surrender of a living will to God in perfect obedience even unto death”. Weiss is strictly accurate in his remark, “<span class="greekheb">αἱμ</span>. kann ohne eine lokale Näherbestimmung nicht die Ausgiessung des Blutes am Altare bezeichnen”. The evidence is furnished by Bleek. The words, if not suggested by, inevitably recall our Lord’s words (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>) <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης τὸ περὶ πολλῶν ἐκχυννόμενον εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν</span>. Cleansing was required of everything connected with God’s worship, because it was stained through contact with men. And that this stain was guilt is implied in the use of <span class="greekheb">ἄφεσις</span>. It is by remission of sin the stain is removed. And according to the great law of <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm" title="For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you on the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.">Leviticus 17:11</a>, this remission was attained by the shedding of blood <span class="greekheb">τὸ γὰρ αἶμα ἀντὶ ψυχῆς ἐξιλάσεται</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄφεσις</span> is used absolutely only here and in <a href="/mark/3-29.htm" title="But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.">Mark 3:29</a>; elsewhere it is used with <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτιῶν</span> or <span class="greekheb">παραπτωμάτων</span>.
