The priests offered sacrifices to God, but were limited to the outer sanctuary, which was not the place of God’s manifested presence; a fit symbol this of offerings which cannot purify the conscience (see <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>).

Christ, having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaven till he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, either into God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both in judgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? They leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the blood of Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading it for us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, saw something of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and of admission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelites in general looked no further than the outward forms. These could not take away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did the service. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, of clearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greater love, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. We have greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, and greater obligations to a more holy living.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which was a figure for the time then present - That is, as long as the tabernacle stood.

Here it is used in the sense of "image, or symbol" - something to "represent" other things. The idea is, that the arrangements and services of the tabernacle were a representation of important realities, and of things which were more fully to be revealed at a future period. There can be no doubt that Paul meant to say that this service in general was symbolical or typical, though this will not authorize us to attempt to spiritualize every minute arrangement of it. Some of the things in which it was typical are specified by the apostle himself, and wisdom and safety in explaining the arrangements of the tabernacle and its services consist in adhering very closely to the explanations furnished by the inspired writers. An interpreter is on an open sea, to be driven he knows not whither, when he takes leave of these safe pilots. <p>Both gifts - Thank-offerings.<p>And sacrifices - Bloody offerings. The idea is, that all kinds of offerings to God were made there.<p>That could not make him that did the service perfect - That could not take away sin, and remove the stains of guilt on the soul; note, <a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11</a>; compare <a href="/hebrews/8-7.htm">Hebrews 8:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a>.<p>As pertaining to the conscience - They related mainly to outward and ceremonial rites, and even when offerings were made for sin the conscience was not relieved. They could not expiate guilt; they could not make the soul pure; they could not of themselves impart peace to the soul by reconciling it to God. They could not fully accomplish what the conscience needed to have done in order to give it peace. Nothing will do this but the blood of the Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The time of the temple-worship really belonged to the Old Testament, but continued still in Paul's time and that of his Hebrew readers. "The time of reformation" (Heb 9:10) stands in contrast to this, "the existing time"; though, in reality, "the time of reformation," the New Testament time, was now present and existing. So "the age to come," is the phrase applied to the Gospel, because it was present only to believers, and its fulness even to them is still to come. Compare Heb 9:11, "good things to come."<p>in which&#8212;tabernacle, not time, according to the reading of the oldest manuscripts.

For the verb to be supplemented would not be the mere copula; it would have a peculiar signification, and thus could not be omitted. <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> alone is consequently the subject, and <span class="greekheb">παραβολή</span> the predicate. Yet <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> is not to be referred back to <span class="greekheb">στάσιν</span> (Chr. Fr.

Nor have we to assume an attraction to <span class="greekheb">παραβολή</span>, in such wise that <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> should stand in the sense of <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> (so Bengel, who makes it point back to <a href="/context/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God....">Hebrews 9:6-8</a>; Maier, who makes it refer to <a href="/context/hebrews/9-7.htm" title="But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:...">Hebrews 9:7-8</a>; Michaelis, who makes it refer to <span class="greekheb">μήπω πεφανερῶσθαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and others), or, what amounts to the same thing, to supplement to the phrase <span class="greekheb">ἥτις παραβολή</span>, comprehended together as a subject, <span class="greekheb">παραβολή ἐστιν</span> as a predicate: which emblem (described <a href="/context/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God....">Hebrews 9:6-8</a>) is an emblem for the present time (so Nickel in <span class="ital">Reuter’s Repertor</span>. 1858, März, p. 188 f.). for, in the course of <a href="/context/hebrews/9-9.htm" title="Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;...">Hebrews 9:9-10</a>, respect is had just to the closing words <span class="ital">alone</span> of <a href="/hebrews/9-8.htm" title="The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:">Hebrews 9:8</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἔτι τῆς πρώτης σκηνῆς ἐχούσης στάσιν</span>.

This is the simplest construction (<span class="ital">Cf.</span> Winer, p. 207). That suggested by Primasius and Vaughan—“Which thing (the fact of there being a <span class="greekheb">πρώτη σκηνὴ</span> separate from the Holy of Holies) was a parable”—is grammatically admissible. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καιρὸν τὸν ἐνεστηκότα</span>, “for the time being”. In the usual division of time into past, present and future, the present was termed <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐνεστώς</span>. But present to whom? Several interpreters reply, To those living under the Christian dispensation. So especially Delitzsch and Alford. But N.T. usage, and especially the usage of this Epistle which speaks of the Christian dispensation as “the coming age” (<a href="/hebrews/6-5.htm" title="And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,">Hebrews 6:5</a>), “the future world” (<a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a>), indicates that “the present time” must refer to the O.T. period. Besides, the opposition to <span class="greekheb">καιρὸς διορθώσεως</span> points in the same direction; as also does the clause under <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἥν</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is here “with reference to”. And the meaning is, that the outer tent which did not itself contain God’s presence, but rather stood barring access to it, was a parable of the entire dispensation. In other words, this Tabernacle arrangement was a striking symbol of the Mosaic economy which could not of itself effect spiritual approach and abiding fellowship with God. The Levitical <span class="greekheb">δικαιώματα</span> themselves, on the ground of which all these arrangements proceed, emphatically declared their own inadequacy. Wrapped up in them was the truth that they could not bring the worshipper into God’s presence. <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἣν δῶρά τε</span> … “in accordance with which [parable] are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot perfect him that doth the service as regards conscience, being only ordinances of the flesh resting upon meats and drinks and divers washings, imposed until a time of rectification”. <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἣν</span>- referring to <span class="greekheb">παραβολὴ</span>; it is in accordance with the parabolic significance of the Tabernacle and its arrangements, that gifts and sacrifices were offered which could only purge the flesh, not the conscience. <span class="greekheb">μὴ δυνάμεναι</span>, Winer’s note (p. 608) is misleading. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Jebb’s Appendix to Vincent and Dickson’s <span class="ital">Modern Greek</span>, p. 340. “In later Greek, <span class="greekheb">μή</span> tended to usurp the place of <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>,” especially with participles. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Blass, 255. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ συνείδησιν τελειῶσαι</span> means, to give to the worshipper the consciousness that he is inwardly cleansed from defilement and is truly in communion with God; to bring conscience finally into peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">which was a figure for the time then present</span>] i.e. And this outer Tabernacle is a parable for the present time. By “the present time” he means the prae-Christian epoch in which the unconverted Jews were still (practically) living. The full inauguration of the New Covenant of which Christ had prophesied as his Second Coming, began with the final annulment of the Old, which was only completed when the Temple fell, and when the observance of the Levitic system thus became (by the manifest interposition of God in history) a thing simply <span class="ital">impossible</span>. A Christian was already living in “the Future Aeon” (<span class="ital">Olam habba</span>); a Jew who had not embraced the Gospel still belonged to “the present time” (<span class="ital">olam hazzeh</span> <span class="greekheb">ὁ καιρὸς ὁ ἐνεστηκώς</span>). The meaning of the verse is that the very existence of an <span class="ital">outer</span> Tabernacle (“the Holy Place”) emphasized the fact that close access to God (of which the entrance of the High Priest into the Holiest was a symbol) was not permitted under the Old Covenant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in which</span> …”] The true reading is not <span class="greekheb">καθ</span>' <span class="greekheb">ὅν</span>, but <span class="greekheb">καθ</span>' <span class="greekheb">ἥν</span>, so that the “which” refers to the word “parable” or “symbol,” “in accordance with which symbolism of the outer Tabernacle, both gifts and sacrifices are being offered, such as (<span class="greekheb">μὴ</span>) are not able, so far as the <span class="ital">conscience</span> is concerned, to perfect the worshipper.” He says “are offered” and “him that <span class="ital">does</span> the service,” using the present (not as in the A. V. the past tense), because he is throwing himself into the position of the Jew who still clings to the Old Covenant. The introduction of “a clear conscience” (or moral consciousness) into the question may seem like a new thought, but it is not. The implied argument is this: only the innocent can “ascend the hill of the Lord, and stand in His Holy Place:” the High Priest was regarded as <span class="ital">symbolically</span> innocent by virtue of minute precautions against any ceremonial defilement, and because he carried with him the atonement for his own sins and those of the people: <span class="ital">he</span> therefore, <span class="ital">but he alone</span>, was permitted to approach God by entering the Holiest Place. The worshippers in general were so little regarded as “perfected in conscience” that only the Priests could enter even the <span class="ital">outer</span> “Holy” (<a href="/context/hebrews/7-18.htm" title="For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof....">Hebrews 7:18-19</a>, <a href="/context/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect....">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm" title="And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:">Hebrews 10:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm" title="Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;">Hebrews 9:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἥτις παραβολὴ</span>, <span class="ital">which is a figure</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> for <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, before the feminine, <span class="greekheb">παραβολὴ</span>.
