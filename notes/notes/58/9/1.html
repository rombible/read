The mention of the “more excellent ministry” led to the description of the new covenant with which it is united (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6-13</a>). This verse, then, attaches itself to the fifth and sixth verses of Hebrews 8 (<a href="/context/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5-6</a>): “Even the first (covenant), then, had ordinances of divine service and its sanctuary, of this world.” The “service” is spoken of again in <a href="/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.">Hebrews 9:6</a>; the “ordinances” in <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm" title="Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.">Hebrews 9:10</a>, where they are called “carnal.” Very similar is the language here, for the words so emphatically standing at the close of the verse are probably descriptive not of the “sanctuary” only, but also of the “ordinances.” Both place and ministrations belonged to <span class= "ital">this world, </span>and thus stand in contrast with “the heavenly things,” of which the Tabernacle was a token and shadow. (See Note on <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>.) The ordinary Greek text (here following the first printed Greek Testament) has “the first Tabernacle,” and this reading was followed by Tyndale and Coverdale. All ancient MSS. omit the word; and, as in a long succession of verses “covenant” has been the leading thought, the rendering of the Authorised version is certainly correct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a></span>. To show that the old covenant was justly laid aside, the apostle judged it necessary to enter into a particular examination of the religious services which it enjoined, and to prove that these were designed not for cleansing the consciences of the worshippers, but to prefigure the services and blessings of the new or gospel covenant: so that the latter being come, there was no longer occasion for continuing the former to prefigure them. This chapter, therefore, is an illustration of chap. <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>, where the apostle affirms that the priests worshipped God in the tabernacles unto the example or pattern and shadow of heavenly things. And it was proper to explain this matter copiously, because it must have had a great influence in weaning the Hebrews from the Levitical services, and in reconciling them to the abrogation of a form of worship which, though of divine appointment, was now become useless, having accomplished its end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Then verily the first covenant </span>— Many copies read here <span class="greekheb">πρωτη σκηνη</span>, <span class="ital">the first tabernacle; </span>but as that reading does not agree with <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2</a>, Beza and Mill prefer the reading of the Alexandrian and other MSS. of good authority, which have <span class="greekheb">πρωτη</span>, leaving the reader to supply <span class="greekheb">διαθηκη</span>, <span class="ital">covenant, </span>from the preceding verse.

The meaning of the apostle is, that the Sinai covenant had these things annexed to it when it was first made, as its privileges and glory. For in the whole discourse he has continual respect to the first making of the covenant, and the first institution of its administrations; and this was that part of divine worship about which God had so many controversies with the people of Israel, under the Old Testament. The law of this worship was a hedge that God had set about them to keep them from superstition and idolatry. And, if at any time they brake over it, or neglected it, they failed not to rush into the most abominable idolatries. On the other hand, oftentimes they placed all their trust and confidence for their acceptance with God, and reception of blessings from him, on the external observance of its institutions. And hereby they countenanced themselves, not only in a neglect of moral duties and spiritual obedience, but in a course of flagitious sins, and various wickednesses. To repress these exorbitances, with respect to both extremes, the ministry of the prophets was, in an especial manner, directed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 The apostle shows to the Hebrews the typical reference of their ceremonies to Christ. The tabernacle was a movable temple, shadowing forth the unsettled state of the church upon earth, and the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. The typical meaning of these things has been shown in former remarks, and the ordinances and articles of the Mosaic covenant point out Christ as our Light, and as the Bread of life to our souls; and remind us of his Divine Person, his holy priesthood, perfect righteousness, and all-prevailing intercession. Thus was the Lord Jesus Christ, all and in all, from the beginning. And as interpreted by the gospel, these things are a glorious representation of the wisdom of God, and confirm faith in Him who was prefigured by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then verily - Or, moreover. The object is to describe the tabernacle in which the service of God was celebrated under the former dispensation, and to show that it had a reference to what was future, and was only an imperfect representation of the reality. It was important to show this, as the Jews regarded the ordinances of the tabernacle and of the whole Levitical service as of divine appointment, and of perpetual obligation. The object of Paul is to prove that they were to give place to a more perfect system, and hence, it was necessary to discuss their real nature.<p>The first covenant - The word "covenant" is not in the Greek, but is not improperly supplied. The meaning is, that the former arrangement or dispensation had religious rites and services connected with it.<p>Had also ordinances - Margin, "Ceremonies." The Greek word means "laws, precepts, ordinances;" and the idea is, that there were laws regulating the worship of God. The Jewish institutions abounded with such laws.<p>And a worldly sanctuary - The word "sanctuary" means a holy place, and is applied to a house of worship, or a temple. Here it may refer either to the temple or to the tabernacle. As the temple was constructed after the same form as the tabernacle, and had the same furniture, the description of the apostle may be regarded as applicable to either of them, and it is difficult to determine which he had in his eye. The term "worldly," applied to "sanctuary," here means that it pertained to this world; it was contradistinguished from the heavenly sanctuary not made with hands where Christ was now gone; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-24</a>. It does not mean that it was "worldly" in the sense in which that word is now used as denoting the opposite of spiritual, serious, religious; but worldly in the sense that it belonged to the earth rather than to heaven; it was made by human hands, not directly by the hands of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Heb 9:1-28.

The design of the apostle in this chapter, as it stands in connection with what goes before, is to show the pre-eminence of Christ, from the tabernacle, and the things in it; as well as from the priesthood and covenant; and as also the abrogation of the Levitical ceremonies in particular, as well as the first covenant in general; and that they were all types and figures of Christ, and had their fulfilment in him: the word "first", here used, designs not the tabernacle, but the covenant; therefore it is rightly thus supplied in our version, as it is in the Arabic and Ethiopic versions: which is said to have "ordinances of divine service"; belonging to the service of God, which was performed both by the priests, and by the people; and these ordinances were no other than the carnal ordinances, or rites of the ceremonial law: the word used signifies "righteousnesses"; and they are so called, because they were appointed by a righteous God; and were imposed on the people of the Jews in a righteous way; and by them men became externally and typically righteous; for they were figures and types of justification by the righteousness of Christ, though no complete, perfect, real righteousness, came by them. <p>And a worldly sanctuary. Philo the Jew says (l), it was a type of the world, and of the various things in it; though it was rather either a type of the church, or of heaven, or of Christ's human nature: the better reason of its being so called is, because it consisted of earthly matter, and worldly things; it was in the world, and only had its use in the world, and so is opposed to the heavenly sanctuary; for the Jews often speak of , "a sanctuary above", and , "a sanctuary below" (m), and of , "a tabernacle above", and , "a tabernacle below" (n); which answered to one another: the words may be rendered "a beautiful sanctuary", a well adorned one; and such especially was the temple, or sanctuary built by Solomon, rebuilt by Zerubbabel, and repaired and adorned by Herod, <a href="/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5</a>.

For as the statement <span class="greekheb">τό τε ἅγιον κοσμικόν</span> receives its more full explication by means of <a href="/context/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary....">Hebrews 9:2-5</a>, so does the discourse in <a href="/context/hebrews/9-6.htm" title="Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God....">Hebrews 9:6-7</a> return to the unfolding of the twofold <span class="greekheb">δικαιώματα λατρείας</span>, blended as this is in a logical respect into a unity of idea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τό τε ἅγιον κοσμικόν</span>] <span class="ital">and the mundane sanctuary</span>. Since, in accordance with the <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, possessions of the Old Covenant are to be mentioned, such as this has in common with the New,—while to the New Covenant there pertains no mundane, earthly sanctuary,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τό τε ἅγιον κοσμικόν</span> must be regarded as a concise mode of designation for <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἅγιόν τι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ κοσμικόν</span>, “and a sanctuary, namely the mundane.” That such is the meaning of the author, is indicated by the fact that the article is placed before this second member, although it ought properly to have been inserted before <span class="greekheb">κοσμικόν</span> also. Yet the omission of the article in the case of adjectives placed after their substantives is not a thing unknown among other writers of the later period. See Bernhardy, <span class="ital">Synt</span>. p. 323; Winer, <span class="ital">Gramm.</span>, 7 Aufl. p. 126. Forced is the explanation of Delitzsch, with the adherence of Kurtz and Woerner, that <span class="greekheb">κοσμικόν</span> as an adjectival predicate is to be taken in association with <span class="greekheb">εἶχεν</span>: “the first covenant had likewise <span class="greekheb">δικαιώματα λατρείας</span>, and its sanctuary as mundane, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> a sanctuary of mundane nature.” Had the author intended the readers to suppose such a conjoining, he would also—equally as <a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm" title="But this man, because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood.">Hebrews 7:24</a>, <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>—have indicated the same to them by the position of the words. He must, in order to be understood, at least have written: <span class="greekheb">εἶχεν μὲν οὖν καὶ ἡ πρώτη δικαιώματα λατρείας κοσμικόν τε τὸ ἅγιον</span>. Under an entire misapprehension, further, does Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 408 f., 2 Anfl.) suppose that <span class="greekheb">τό τε ἅγιον κοσμικόν</span> is not to be taken as a second <span class="ital">object</span> attaching itself to the <span class="greekheb">δικαιώματα λατρείας</span>, but as a second <span class="ital">subject</span> joining itself on to <span class="greekheb">ἡ πρώτη</span>,—a construction which, upon the presupposition of the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> <span class="greekheb">ἡ πρώτη σκηνή</span> being the correct reading, already Olearius adopted (comp. Wolf <span class="ital">ad loc</span>.), and upon the same supposition also more recently M‘Caul maintained, in connection with which, however, <span class="greekheb">τό τε ἅγιον κοσμικόν</span> would limp behind in an intolerable manner, and would afford evidence of a negligence of style, such as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews would least of all have been guilty of.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The view of Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Zeger, Carpzov, and others, that <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span> is to be taken not in the <span class="ital">local</span> sense (sanctuary), but in the <span class="ital">ethical</span> sense (holiness, <span class="greekheb">ἁγιότης</span>, sanctitas, mundities), is altogether erroneous; since the expression chosen would be a remarkable one, the immediate sequel does not point thereto, and the more exalted seat of the cultus of the New Covenant forms the theme of the fresh train of thought opened up with the beginning of chap. 8<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Quite as much to be disapproved is the opinion of Wolf, who will have <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span> to mean “vasa sacra totumque apparatum Leviticum.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κοσμικός</span>] means: <span class="ital">belonging to the world, worldly, mundanus</span>. Comp. <a href="/titus/2-12.htm" title="Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;">Titus 2:12</a>. The expression is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγειος</span>, and to it <span class="greekheb">ἐπουράνοις</span> stands opposed, as in general <span class="greekheb">ὁ κόσμος</span> in the N. T. very frequently has its tacit contrast in <span class="greekheb">ὁ οὐρανός</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ ἅγιον κοσμικόν</span> is consequently nothing else than <span class="greekheb">ἡ σκηνή</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἔπηξεν ἄνθρωπος</span> (comp. <a href="/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>), or <span class="greekheb">ἡ σκηνὴ χειροποίητος</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστιν ταύτης τῆς κτίσεως</span> (comp. <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>), or <span class="greekheb">τὰ χειροποίητα ἅγια</span> (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>), and a twofold idea is expressed in the adjective, first, that the sanctuary of the Old Covenant is one existing in the terrestrial world, then, that it is accordingly something only temporary and imperfect in its nature. Remote from the connection are the suppositions of Chrysostom, Theophylact, Erasmus, and others: that the Jewish sanctuary was called <span class="greekheb">κοσμικόν</span>, because the access to the same stood open to the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the Gentiles; a statement, moreover, which possesses historic truth only with reference to <span class="ital">a part</span> thereof, the court of the Gentiles (comp. Josephus, <span class="ital">de Bello Jud</span>. v. 5. 2; <a href="/acts/21-28.htm" title="Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.">Acts 21:28</a>), while here the sanctuary <span class="ital">as a whole</span> must be indicated;—of Theodorus Mopsuesten., Theodoret,[88] Grotius, Hammond, Wetstein, Böhme, Paulus, and others: because the Jewish sanctuary symbolically represented the universe; the holy place, earth; the most holy, heaven; and the curtain before the latter, the firmament;—of Kypke, because the sense is: <span class="ital">toto terrarum orbe celebratum</span> (comp. Josephus, <span class="ital">de Bello Jud</span>. iv. 5. 2, where the Jerusalem high priests, Ananus and Jesus, are represented as <span class="greekheb">τῆς κοσμικῆς θρησκείας κατάρχοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">προσκυνούμενοί τε τοῖς ἐκ τῆς οἰκουμένη<span class="bld"><span class="ital">ς</span></span></span>), which, however, could only be said with reference to the temple, not with reference to the tabernacle itself, of which the author is here specially thinking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Entirely baseless, finally, is the opinion of Homberg, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΣΜΙΚΌΝ</span></span></span> is to be apprehended in the sense of “adorned, well-ordered.” For only <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΣΜΙΟς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΚΟΣΜΗΤΙΚΌς</span></span></span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΣΜΗΤΌς</span></span></span> are used for the expression of this notion; never is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΣΜΙΚΊς</span></span></span> put for it.

The author has in chap. 8 insisted upon the fact, as a second main particular of the superiority of Christ as a high priest over the Levitical high priests, that the sanctuary in which He ministers is a more excellent one, namely, the heavenly sanctuary. He has made good this proposition by the consideration that no place would be found for Christ, as regards priestly service, in the earthly sanctuary; and then has proceeded to show the naturalness of the fact that He accomplishes His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, by the proof that He is the Mediator of a better covenant. This train of thought is still pursued in the beginning of chap. 9, in that attention is now finally called to the fact that in the arrangement of the Mosaic sanctuary itself, and the order of the priestly service corresponding thereto, there lies an indication on the part of God that Mosaism is not itself the perfect religion, but only an institution preparatory thereto (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary....">Hebrews 9:1-8</a>). With this, however, is then connected, by means of one of those sudden transitions of which the author is so fond, the reference to the further truth, that, indeed, the Levitical <span class="ital">sacrifices</span> also, since they belong to the domain of fleshly ordinance, are not able really to atone; whereas the sacrifice presented by Christ, by means of His own blood, possesses, by virtue of an eternal Spirit, everlasting power of atonement (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-9.htm" title="Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;...">Hebrews 9:9-14</a>), and thus <span class="ital">a third main point in the high-priestly superiority of Christ is introduced</span>, the development of which occupies the author as far as <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm" title="Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.">Hebrews 10:18</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary....">Hebrews 9:1-14</a>. The insufficiency of the first covenant is further illustrated from the character of its ordinances. For it was not devoid of elaborate and impressive appointments and regulations for worship, but these only pictured their own inefficiency. Especially did the exclusion from the holiest place of all but the High Priest, who himself could only enter once a year and with blood, signify that so long as these ordinances remained there could be no perfect approach of the worshipper to God. But this approach was achieved by Christ who ministered in the tabernacle not made with hands, and by His own blood cleansed the conscience and thus brought men into true fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Then verily the first tabernacle had also ordinances</span>] Rather, “To resume then, even the first (<span class="ital">covenant</span>) had its ordinances.” No substantive is expressed with “first,” but the train of reasoning in the last chapter sufficiently shews that “Covenant,” not “Tabernacle,” is the word to be supplied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">had</span>] Although he often refers to the Levitic ordinances as still continuing, he here contemplates them as obsolete and practically annulled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and a worldly sanctuary</span>] Rather, “and its sanctuary—a material one.” The word <span class="ital">kosmikon</span>, rendered “worldly,” means that the Jewish Sanctuary was visible and temporary—a <span class="ital">mundane</span> structure in contrast to the Heavenly, Eternal Sanctuary. The adjective “worldly” only occurs here and in <a href="/titus/2-12.htm" title="Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;">Titus 2:12</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm" title="Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡ πρώτη</span>, <span class="ital">the first</span>) Supply <span class="greekheb">διαθήκη</span>, <span class="ital">testament</span> or <span class="ital">covenant;</span> not <span class="greekheb">σκηνή</span>, <span class="ital">tabernacle</span>.
