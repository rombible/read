Christ, having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaven till he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, either into God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both in judgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? They leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the blood of Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading it for us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, saw something of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and of admission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelites in general looked no further than the outward forms. These could not take away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did the service. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, of clearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greater love, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. We have greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, and greater obligations to a more holy living.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When these things were thus ordained - Thus arranged or appointed.

The participle <span class="ital">perfect</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατεσκευασμένων</span>, however, denotes that which is extending out of the past into the present, and is still enduring in the present (see Winer, <span class="ital">Gramm.</span>, 7 Aufl. p. 254). The present hereby indicated can, of course, only be that in which the author himself is living and writing. The endeavour to explain it of a present into which the author only mentally places himself, is as little warranted grammatically as is the asserting, with Hofmann, that the present in which the discourse here moves is “not a past, nor actual, nor something still continuing, but that set forth in the word of God, where it is to be read how the sanctuary erected by Moses was constituted, and what priests and high priests do in the same;” or with Mangold (in Bleek’s <span class="ital">Einleit. in das N. T.</span> p. 617), to find the Scripture picture of the tabernacle drawn in our passage as a “purely ideal magnitude, which by no means guarantees the actual continued existence of the temple worship.” For, in order to render possible suppositions of this kind, the conjoining of the <span class="ital">presents</span> with a participle <span class="ital">aorist</span> would have been indispensably necessary. From the form of discourse chosen: <span class="greekheb">τούτων οὕτως κατεσκενασμένων</span> (“in that these objects have been in such wise regulated”), in union with the present tenses <span class="greekheb">εἰσίασιν</span> and <span class="greekheb">προσφέρει</span>, it therefore follows of necessity that the author, although here entering only upon the presentation of the typical significance of the two main divisions of the Mosaic sanctuary, nevertheless thinks of these two main divisions, together with all that appertains to them,—which he has just now enumerated,—as still preserved in being, thus also as still present in the Jewish temple of his day; by which supposition, it is true, he becomes involved in contradiction with the historic reality, inasmuch as alike the ark of the covenant as the vessel of manna and Aaron’s rod were wanting in the second temple. <span class="ital">Vid. supra ad</span> <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm" title="Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;">Hebrews 9:4</a>. With very little reflection does Riehm (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 491, <span class="ital">Obs</span>.) object to this conclusion, that “with just the same right one might infer from the present in <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11</a> that the author supposed the Israelites of his time to be still dwelling in a camp.” The passage <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm" title="For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.">Hebrews 13:11</a> has nothing whatever in common with ours, since it is here a question of the combination of a participle <span class="ital">perfect</span> with verbs in the present. That, too, which Delitzsch sets against it, that the <span class="greekheb">τούτων οὕτως κατεσκευασμένων</span>, pointing back to <span class="greekheb">κατεσκευάσθη</span>, <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2</a>, certainly shows that the author has the Mosaic period before his mind, utterly collapses, inasmuch as the participle <span class="ital">perfect</span>, and not the participle <span class="ital">aorist</span>, has been employed. Phrases, however, like those met with in Delitzsch: that the author was writing for just such readers as would not have given him credit for an ignorance like this, are peremptory decisions, for which the result is already fixed before the investigation, and consequently intimidations of the grammatical conscience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ πρώτη σκηνή</span>] as <a href="/hebrews/9-2.htm" title="For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.">Hebrews 9:2</a>, <span class="ital">the fore-tent</span> or <span class="ital">Holy Place</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ παντός</span>] <span class="ital">continually, i.e.</span> day by day.
