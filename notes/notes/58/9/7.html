After the high-priest had filled the holy place with a cloud of incense, he returned to the altar of burnt-offerings without the tabernacle, where the sacrifice had been newly slain; and while the blood of the beasts was fresh, and, as it were, living, he took of it in his hand, and entering again into the most holy place, sprinkled it seven times with his finger toward the mercy-seat. <span class="ital">Which he offered — </span>Where or when he offered it is not expressed: in the holy place there was no use of blood but for the sprinkling of it, but the sprinkling of blood was always consequential to the offering properly so called.

By <span class="ital">the errors of the people, </span>are meant their sins of ignorance, to which only, and not to sins presumptuously committed, those atonements extended. They were offered for the whole nation, to make atonement for the sins which they had ignorantly committed during the preceding year, and to open the tabernacle for their acts of worship during the succeeding year. And to show this, the high-priest carried the blood of these sacrifices into the inward tabernacle, and sprinkled it before the symbol of the divine presence.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:6-10 The apostle goes on to speak of the Old Testament services. Christ, having undertaken to be our High Priest, could not enter into heaven till he had shed his blood for us; and none of us can enter, either into God's gracious presence here, or his glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus. Sins are errors, great errors, both in judgment and practice; and who can understand all his errors? They leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be washed away but by the blood of Christ. We must plead this blood on earth, while he is pleading it for us in heaven. A few believers, under the Divine teaching, saw something of the way of access to God, of communion with him, and of admission into heaven through the promised Redeemer, but the Israelites in general looked no further than the outward forms. These could not take away the defilement or dominion of sin. They could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the doubts, of him who did the service. Gospel times are, and should be, times of reformation, of clearer light as to all things needful to be known, and of greater love, causing us to bear ill-will to none, but good-will to all. We have greater freedom, both of spirit and speech, in the gospel, and greater obligations to a more holy living.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But into the second - The second apartment or room, called the most holy place; <a href="/hebrews/9-3.htm">Hebrews 9:3</a>.<p>Went the high priest alone once every year - On the great day of atonement; <a href="/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>.

The Jewish tradition is, that he entered the Holy of Holies four times on that day. After all, however, the number of times is not certain, nor is it material, the only important point being that he entered it only on one day of the year, while the holy place was entered every day.<p>Not without blood - That is, he bare with him blood to sprinkle on the mercy-seat.

The object was to make expiation for all the errors and sins of the people, and this occurred once in the year. The repetition of these sacrifices was a constant remembrancer of sin, and the design was that neither the priests nor the people should lose sight of the fact that they were violators of the Law of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. once every year&#8212;the tenth day of the seventh month.

Pausanias (w) makes mention of a temple of Minerva into which the priests entered once every year; which very likely was observed in imitation of this custom of the Jewish high priest; who in it was a type of Christ, and of his entrance into heaven, and of his constant and continued intercession there: <p>not without blood; for he went in with the blood of the bullock and the blood of the goat; which was typical of the blood of Christ, by which he entered in once into the holy place, into heaven, when he had obtained eternal redemption by it, <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a> which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people; the bullock was offered by the high priest for himself and his family; and the goat for the sins of the people of Israel, even all their iniquities, transgressions, and sins, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-11.htm">Leviticus 16:11</a>, but Christ the antitype having no sin, had no need to offer for himself, only for the sins of the people; See Gill on <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>. <p>(q) T.

They may be summarized, in their main characteristics, thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The high priest brought to the door of the tabernacle a bullock as a sin offering for himself, and two goats as a sin offering for the people; also a ram as a burnt offering for himself, and a ram as a burnt offering for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> After washing and arraying himself in white linen garments (not the ordinary official dress), he cast lots on the two goats which were for the people's sin offering - one lot being "for the LORD," the other "for Azazel;" that on which the former lot fell being for sacrifice, the other to be set free. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> He sacrificed his own sin offering, entered the holy place with the blood thereof, filled a censer with burning coals from the golden altar, went with it within the veil, sprinkling incense on the coals, "that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat, that he die not;" took also the blood within the veil, and sprinkled the mercy-seat therewith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> He returned outside the tabernacle, sacrificed the people's sin offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the goat that was "for the LORD," entered the holy place with its blood, and proceeded as before; sprinkling also the altar of incense, as well as the mercy-seat, with the blood of both sacrifices, to "hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> He again returned outside the tabernacle, laid his hands on the head of the goat "for Azazel," confessing over him "all the iniquities of the children of Israel, putting them on the head of the goat," and sent him away to the wilderness, where he was to be let go. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> He again entered the tabernacle, where he put off his linen garments, and left them there, and then, after washing again, and putting on his ordinary official dress, sacrificed his own and the people's burnt offering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The bodies of the two sin offerings (the bullock and the slain goat) were taken outside the camp, and there entirely consumed by fire. The points in this ceremonial here especially noted are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the entrance within the veil was only "once in the year," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on one only day in the year; for on that day the high priest entered more than once. The meaning is that ordinarily, except on that single day, approach to the innermost shrine was closed to all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That even on that day the high priest <span class="accented">alone</span> entered; neither the people, nor even the priesthood generally, ever had approach to the holiest of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That even he could not enter "without blood;" neither the daily sacrifices nor all the ordinary ceremonial of the Law availed for his access: he must take with him the blood of special sin offerings, or he still could not enter and live. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> This blood he offered "for <span class="accented">himself</span> and for the <span class="accented">ignorances</span> of the people;" for <span class="accented">himself</span>, since he too was "compassed with infirmity," and required atonement (ver. 2), and also for the people's <span class="accented">ignorances.</span> There is a significance in this word. It was not the sins done with a high hand that had to be atoned for on that day; these were either visited by "<span class="accented">cutting</span> off," or atoned for in ways appointed for the purpose: it was the less definite and undetected sinfulness, infecting the whole community, and remaining after all ceremonial cleansing, so as to debar them from coming "boldly to the throne of grace," that was yearly kept in remembrance on the Day of Atonement. Hence before even the high priest could enter and not die, the mercy-seat over "the testimony" which was within the ark must be enveloped with the cloud of incense and sprinkled with the blood which "covereth sin" (the verb translated "make atonement for" means properly "cover"). The sin was still not taken away, only "covered" for the time; for the holy of holies after the ceremony remained closed as before, and the same rites had to be repeated at each yearly entrance. All that was expressed was an ever-recurring need of atonement, not yet effected truly, though symbolically prefigured. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all</span> (so the A.V., giving the idea correctly, though the expression is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which <span class="accented">might</span> denote only the holy place, as in ver. 2, if we there read <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, but is used for the holy of holies in vers. 24, 25, and for its heavenly antitype in ver. 13. This last, as typified in the earthly sanctuary, is what is intended here) <span class="cmt_word">hath not yet been made manifest, while as the first tabernacle is yet standing</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">has standing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); has a place in the symbolical representation). The "first tabernacle" here spoken of certainly does not mean the earthly one as opposed to the heavenly, but what the expression denotes throughout the chapter, the holy place in distinction from the holy of holies. How, then, is the continued existence of this a sign that the way to the heavenly holy of holies has not yet been made manifest? Obviously because it intervenes between the congregation and the holy of holies of the earthly tabernacle, debarring all approach to the latter, and even hiding it from their view. This debarring intervention signifies that there is no approach for them as yet to what the holy of holies symbolizes. Further, the ordinary ministry of the priests themselves did not extend beyond this "first tabernacle:" this alone was the sphere of the services which they accomplished daily; and so the very fact of its existing for this purpose expressed that even their mediation was not availing for access to the inner mercy-seat. And that this was so is intimated with peculiar significance by the direction that, when the high priest alone entered within the veil, none even of them should be in the holy place at all, so as to see beyond it: "And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place" (<a href="/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Errors (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit. ignorances.
