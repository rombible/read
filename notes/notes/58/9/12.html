Our High Priest entered into heaven once for all, and has obtained eternal redemption. The Holy Ghost further signified and showed that the Old Testament sacrifices only freed the outward man from ceremonial uncleanness, and fitted him for some outward privileges. What gave such power to the blood of Christ? It was Christ's offering himself without any sinful stain in his nature or life. This cleanses the most guilty conscience from dead, or deadly, works to serve the living God; from sinful works, such as pollute the soul, as dead bodies did the persons of the Jews who touched them; while the grace that seals pardon, new-creates the polluted soul. Nothing more destroys the faith of the gospel, than by any means to weaken the direct power of the blood of Christ. The depth of the mystery of the sacrifice of Christ, we cannot dive into, the height we cannot comprehend. We cannot search out the greatness of it, or the wisdom, the love, the grace that is in it. But in considering the sacrifice of Christ, faith finds life, food, and refreshment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither by the blood of goats and calves - The Jewish sacrifice consisted of the shedding of the blood of animals. On the great day of the atonement the high priest took with him into the most holy place:<p>(1) the blood of a young bullock <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-11.htm">Leviticus 16:11</a>, which is here called the blood of a "calf," which he offered for his own sin; and,<p>(2) the blood of a goat, as a sin-offering for others; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-9.htm">Leviticus 16:9</a>, <a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15</a>. It was "by," or "by means of" - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;  dia - blood thus sprinkled on the mercyseat, that the high priest sought the forgiveness of his own sins and the sins of the people.<p>But by his own blood - That is, by his own blood shed for the remission of sins. The meaning is, that it was in virtue of his own blood, or "by means" of that, that he sought the pardon of his people. That blood was not shed for himself - for he had no sin - and consequently there was a material difference between his offering and that of the Jewish high priest. The difference related to such points as these.<p>(1) the offering which Christ made was wholly for others; that of the Jewish priest for himself as well as for them.<p>(2) the blood offered by the Jewish priest was that of animals; that offered by the Saviour was his own.<p>(3) that offered by the Jewish priest was only an emblem or type - for it could not take away sin; that offered by Christ had a real efficacy, and removes transgression from the soul.<p>He entered into the holy place - Heaven. The meaning is, that as the Jewish high priest bore the blood of the animal into the Holy of Holies, and sprinkled it there as the means of expiation, so the offering which Christ has to make in heaven, or the consideration on which he pleads for the pardon of his people, is the blood which he shed on Calvary. Having made the atonement, he now pleads the merit of it as a "reason" why sinners should be saved. It is not of course meant that he literally bore his own blood into heaven - as the high priest did the blood of the bullock and the goat into the sanctuary; or that he literally "sprinkled" it on the mercy-seat there, but that that blood, having been shed for sin, is now the ground of his pleading and intercession for the pardon of sin - as the sprinkled blood of the Jewish sacrifice was the ground of the pleading of the Jewish high priest for the pardon of himself and the people.<p>Having obtained eternal redemption for us - That is, by the shedding of his blood. On the meaning of the word "redemption," see notes on <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>. The redemption which the Lord Jesus effected for his people is eternal. It will continue forever. It is not a temporary deliverance leaving the redeemed in danger of falling into sin and ruin, but it makes salvation secure, and in its effects extends through eternity. Who can estimate the extent of that love which purchased for us "such" a redemption? Who can be sufficiently grateful that he is thus redeemed? The doctrine in this verse is, that the blood of Christ is the means of redemption, or atones for sin. In the following verses the apostle shows that it not only makes atonement for sin, but that it is the means of sanctifying or purifying the soul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Neither&#8212;"Nor yet."<p>by&#8212;"through"; as the means of His approach.<p>goats &#8230; calves&#8212;not a bullock, such as the Levitical high priest offered for himself, and a goat for the people, on the day of atonement (Le 16:6, 15), year by year, whence the plural is used, goats &#8230; calves. Besides the goat offered for the people the blood of which was sprinkled before the mercy seat, the high priest led forth a second goat, namely, the scapegoat; over it he confessed the people's sins, putting them on the head of the goat, which was sent as the sin-bearer into the wilderness out of sight, implying that the atonement effected by the goat sin offering (of which the ceremony of the scapegoat is a part, and not distinct from the sin offering) consisted in the transfer of the people's sins on the goat, and their consequent removal out of sight. The translation of sins on the victim usual in other expiatory sacrifices being omitted in the case of the slain goat, but employed in the case of the goat sent away, proved the two goats were regarded as one offering [Archbishop Magee]. Christ's death is symbolized by the slain goat; His resurrection to life by the living goat sent away. Modern Jews substitute in some places a cock for the goat as an expiation, the sins of the offerers being transferred to the entrails, and exposed on the housetop for the birds to carry out of sight, as the scapegoat did; the Hebrew for "man" and "cock" being similar, gebher [Buxtorf].<p>by&#8212;"through," as the means of His entrance; the key unlocking the heavenly Holy of Holies to Him.

This was what was sought for long ago by the, Old Testament saints, who were wishing, waiting, and longing for this salvation; it is a thing very precious and difficult to find; it is to be had nowhere but in Christ, and when found in him, is matter of great joy to sensible sinners; God found it in him, and found him to be a proper person to effect it; and Christ has found it by being the author of it: this is called an eternal redemption, because it extends to the saints in all ages; backwards and forwards; it includes eternal life and happiness; and such as are sharers in it shall never perish, but shall be saved with an everlasting salvation; it is so called in opposition to the carnal expiations of the high priests, and in distinction from temporal redemptions, deliverances, and salvations. Remarkable is the paraphrase of Jonathan ben Uzziel on <a href="/genesis/49-18.htm">Genesis 49:18</a>. <p>"Jacob said, when he saw Gideon the son of Joash, and Samson the son of Manoah, who should be redeemers; not for the redemption of Gideon am I waiting, nor for the redemption of Samson am I looking, for their redemption is a temporal redemption; but for thy redemption am I waiting and looking, O Lord, because thy redemption is , "an everlasting redemption":'' <p>another copy reads, for the redemption of Messiah the son of David; and to the same purpose is the Jerusalem paraphrase on the place; in Talmudic language it would be called  (x). <p>(x) T.

Probably the aorist participle here expresses the result of the action of the main verb, <span class="greekheb">εἰσῆλθεν</span>. “But it is possible that <span class="greekheb">εἰσῆλθεν</span> is used to describe the whole High Priestly act, including both the entrance into the holy place and the subsequent offering of the blood, and that <span class="greekheb">εὑράμενος</span> is thus a participle of identical action. In either case it should be translated not <span class="ital">having obtained</span> as in R.V. but <span class="ital">obtaining</span> or <span class="ital">and obtained</span>” (Burton <span class="ital">M. & T.</span>, 66).

Here it can only mean that Christ obtained salvation by offering Himself. <span class="greekheb">λύτρωσις</span> must, in consistency with the passage, be understood of the deliverance from guilt which enabled the worshipper to enter God’s presence. From this flow all other spiritual blessings. It is here termed <span class="greekheb">αἰωνία</span> in contrast to the deliverance achieved by the Levitical High Priest, which had to be repeated year by year.

When the Prophets speak of sacrifices with such stern disparagement they are only denouncing the superstition which regarded the mere <span class="ital">opus operatum</span> as sufficient apart from repentance and holiness (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/1-10.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah....">Isaiah 1:10-17</a>, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by his own blood</span>] His own blood was the offering by which He was admitted <span class="ital">as our High Priest</span> and <span class="ital">Eternal Redeemer</span> into the Holy of Holies of God’s immediate presence (<a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">once</span>] “once for all.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into the holy place</span>] i.e. into the Holiest, as in <a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm" title="Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-9.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.">Leviticus 16:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">eternal redemption</span>] i.e. “the forgiveness of sins” (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>), and ransom from sinful lives (<a href="/context/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;...">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>) to the service of God (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm" title="And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;">Revelation 5:9</a>). It should always be borne in mind that the Scriptural metaphors of Ransom and Propitiation describe the Atonement by its blessed effects <span class="ital">as regards man</span>. All speculation as to its bearing on the counsels of God, all attempts to frame a scholastic scheme out of metaphors only intended to indicate a transcendent mystery, <span class="ital">by its results for us</span> have led to heresy and error. <span class="ital">To whom</span> was the ransom paid? The question is idle, because “ransom” is only a metaphor of <span class="ital">our deliverance</span> from slavery. For nearly a thousand years the Church was content with the most erroneous, and almost blasphemous notion that the ransom was <span class="ital">paid by God to the devil</span>, which led to still more grievous aberrations. Anselm who exploded this error substituted for it <span class="ital">another</span>—the hard forensic notion of indispensable <span class="ital">satisfaction</span>. Such terms, like those of “substitution,” “vicarious punishment,” “reconciliation of God to us” (for “of <span class="ital">us</span> to God”), have no sanction in Scripture, which only reveals what is necessary for man, and what man can understand, viz. that the love of God in Christ has provided for him a way of escape from ruin, and the forgiveness of sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having obtained … for us</span>] The “for us” is rightly supplied; but the <span class="ital">middle voice</span> of the verb shews that Christ in His love to us also regarded the redemption as dear to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τράγων καὶ μόσχων</span>, <span class="ital">of goats and calves</span>) One goat and one bullock was sacrificed at one time, <a href="/leviticus/16-9.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.">Leviticus 16:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm" title="Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:3</a> : but that particular animal was not by itself better than all the animals of the same species; therefore it is here put in the plural number An additional reason besides, for the plural, was the annual repetition of the sacrifices. <span class="greekheb">פר</span>, LXX., <span class="greekheb">μόσχος</span>, <a href="/leviticus/16-9.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.">Leviticus 16:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm" title="Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:3</a>, and elsewhere.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰ ἅγια</span>, into the holy place) into heaven, <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">αἰωνίαν</span>, eternal) not merely for a day or a year.—<span class="greekheb">εὑράμενος</span>, having found or obtained) So, I have found a ransom, <a href="/job/33-24.htm" title="Then he is gracious to him, and said, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.">Job 33:24</a>.
