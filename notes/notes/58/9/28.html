The two members of the verse correspond to each other, point by point, with remarkable distinctness; but the first is clearly subordinated to the second. “So the Christ. also, having been once offered that He might bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time apart from sin to them that wait for Him unto salvation.” It is important to notice that, not only is there perfect. parallelism between the two members of this verse, but there is a similar relation between this verse as a whole and <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27</a>. In that were presented two cardinal points of the history of sinful man; in this the main outlines of the Redeemer’s work. Each verse deals first with the present world, and secondly with “the last things.” The two verses, taken together, are connected with the preceding argument by the word “once.” Christ will not “suffer” often. He has been manifested once, to accomplish by one act the “annulling” of sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>). And this is in harmony with the lot of man, who must die once, and but once (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27-28</a>). But what is the exact nature of this correspondence? Do the words simply mean that, as the Christ was man, so it was laid up for Him to die but once? Or may the connection of thought be expressed thus?—The work of redemption is so ordered as to correspond to the course of man’s history: as man must die once, and what remains is the judgment which he must abide, so the Christ has died once, and what remains is His return for judgment—a judgment which He Himself administers, giving salvation to His people. We will not venture to say that the former thought is absent from the words (which are sufficiently general to include both), but certainly the second is the more important. If now we return to <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>, it will be seen that the words “having been once offered” in the first member are answered by “shall appear” in the second; “to bear sins,” by “apart from sin . . . unto salvation;” and “of many,” by “to them that wait for Him.” In <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-25.htm" title="Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;">Hebrews 9:25</a>, the writer spoke of Christ as offering Himself, here as “having been offered;” so in <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a> we read that He “delivered Himself up for us,” but in <a href="/romans/8-32.htm" title="He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?">Romans 8:32</a> that God “delivered Him up for us all,” and in <a href="/romans/4-25.htm" title="Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.">Romans 4:25</a>, “who was delivered up for our offences.” The words which follow are taken (with a slight change) from <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>, “and He bare the sin of many.” These words clearly involve sacrificial imagery. What is signified is not directly the <span class= "ital">removal</span> of sin (as in the different words of <a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>); but, as on the animal to be slain the sins of the offerer were in figure laid, and the death which followed signified the death which the offerer had deserved, so, with an infinite extension of meaning, are the words here applied. It is certainly no mere accident that the writer, thus availing himself of the prophet’s words, speaks of <span class= "ital">the Christ.</span> In contrast with the one Sufferer are the “many” whose sins are borne (comp. <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>). When the Christ shall appear the second time, it shall be “apart from sin”—no longer bearing sin, but “separate from sinners” (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>). Of the judgment which He shall pass upon “the adversaries” (<a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm" title="But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.">Hebrews 10:27</a>) this verse does not speak, but only of His appearing to His own people, who “wait for Him.” This expressive word, again and again used by St. Paul (see Note on <a href="/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>) to describe the attitude of Christ’s people upon earth towards their Lord (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1Corinthians 1:7</a>) and His salvation (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="/romans/8-25.htm" title="But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.">Romans 8:25</a>), is here applied to <span class= "ital">all</span> who love His appearing. By these “He shall be seen” as He is (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>). The last words “unto salvation” declare the purpose of His appearing, in a form which at once recalls the teaching of earlier verses in the Epistle (<a href="/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>), and especially <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm" title="Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.">Hebrews 9:12</a> of this chapter, and which brings to mind the name of Him for whom we wait, the Saviour (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:23-28 It is evident that the sacrifices of Christ are infinitely better than those of the law, which could neither procure pardon for sin, nor impart power against it. Sin would still have been upon us, and have had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ, by one sacrifice, has destroyed the works of the devil, that believers may be made righteous, holy, and happy. As no wisdom, learning, virtue, wealth, or power, can keep one of the human race from death, so nothing can deliver a sinner from being condemned at the day of judgment, except the atoning sacrifice of Christ; nor will one be saved from eternal punishment who despises or neglects this great salvation. The believer knows that his Redeemer liveth, and that he shall see him. Here is the faith and patience of the church, of all sincere believers. Hence is their continual prayer as the fruit and expression of their faith, Even so come, Lord Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So Christ was once offered - Since people are to die but once; and as all beyond the grave is fixed by the judgment, so that his death there would make no change in the destiny, there was a propriety that he should die but once for sin. The argument is, there is one probation only, and therefore there was need of but one sacrifice, or of his dying but once. If death were to occur frequently in the existence of each individual, and if each intermediate period were a state of probation, then there might be a propriety that an atonement should be made with reference to each state. Or if beyond the grave there were a state of probation still, then also there might be propriety that an atoning sacrifice should be offered there. But since neither of these things is true, there was a fitness that the great victim should die but once.<p>(Rather, perhaps, as in the original sentence, "once dying" was the penalty denounced on the sinner, so the substitute in enduring it, is in like manner, under necessity of dying but once. By this he fully answers the requirement of the Law. Or there may be in the passage a simple intimation that, in this respect, as in others. Christ is like us, namely, in being but once subject to death. It would be inconsistent with the nature which he sustains, to suppose him a second time subject to death.)<p>To bear the sins of many - To suffer and die on account of their sins; see <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a> notes; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> note. The phrase does not mean:<p>(1) that Christ was a "sinner" - for that was in no sense true. See <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>. Nor<p>(2) that he literally bore the penalty due to transgression - for that is equally untrue.<p>The penalty of the Law for sin is all which the Law when executed inflicts on the offender for his transgression, and includes, in "fact," remorse of conscience, overwhelming despair, and eternal punishment. But Christ did not suffer forever, nor did he experience remorse of conscience, nor did he endure utter despair. Nor.<p>(3) does it mean that he was literally "punished" for our sins. Punishment pertains only to the guilty. An innocent being may "suffer" for what another does, but there is no propriety in saying that he is "punished" for it. A father suffers much from the misconduct of a son, but we do not say that he is punished for it; a child suffers much from the intemperance of a parent - but no one would say that it was a punishment on the child. Men always connect the idea of criminality with punishment, and when we say that a man is punished, we suppose at once that there is "guilt." The phrase here means simply, that Christ endured sufferings in his own person, which, if they had been inflicted on us, would have been the proper punishment of sin. He who was innocent interposed, and received on himself what was descending to meet us, and consented to be treated "as he would have deserved if he had been a sinner." Thus, he bore what was due to us; and this, in Scripture phrase, is what is meant by "bearing our iniquities;" see the notes <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>.<p>(It is indeed true, that Christ did not endure the very penalty which we had incurred, and, but for his interference, should have endured. His sufferings must be regarded in the light of an equivalent to the Law's original claim, of a satisfaction to its injured honor, which the Lawgiver has been pleased to accept. It is, however, equally true, that the sufferings of Christ were strictly penal. They were the punishment of sin. The true meaning of the important phrase in this verse, "to bear sin," establishes this point. It can have no other meaning than bearing the punishment of sin. See Stuart's xix. Excursus. That punishment supposes guilt is not denied. What then? Not certainly that Christ was personally guilty, but that our guilt has been imputed to him - that he has taken the place of the guilty, and become answerable for their transgressions. See Supp. note, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>.)<p>And unto them that look for him - To his people. It is one of the characteristics of Christians that they look for the return of their Lord; <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>; compare the notes, <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>. They fully believe that he will come. They earnestly desire that he will come; <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>. They are waiting for his appearing; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>. He left the world and ascended to heaven, but he will again return to earth, and his people are looking for that time as the period when they shall be raised up from their graves; when they shall be publicly acknowledged to be his, and when they shall be admitted to heaven; see the notes on <a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>.<p>Shall he appear the second time - He first appeared as the man of sorrows to make atonement for sin. His second appearance will be as the Lord of his people, and the Judge of the quick and the dead; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, see the notes, <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>. The apostle does not say when this would be, nor is any intimation given in the Scriptures when it will occur. It is on the contrary everywhere declared that this is concealed from people <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>, and all that is known respecting the time is, that it will be suddenly and at an unexpected moment; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-50.htm">Matthew 24:50</a>.<p>Without sin - That is, when be comes again he will not make himself a sin-offering; or will not come in order to make atonement for sin. It is not implied that when he came the first time he was in any sense a sinner, but that he came then with reference to sin. or that the main object of his incarnation was to "put away sin by the sacrifice of himself." When he comes the second time, it will be with reference to another object.<p>Unto salvation - That is, to receive his friends and followers to eternal salvation. He will come to save them from all their sins and temptations; to raise them from their graves; to place them at his right hand in glory, and to confirm them in the everlasting inheritance which he has promised to all who truly love him, and who wait for his appearing.<p>In view of this anticipated return of the Redeemer, we may remark:<p>(1) There is a propriety that the Lord Jesus should thus return. He came once to be humbled, despised, and put to death; and there is a fitness that he should come to be honored in his own world.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28.

He did not need to die again and again for each individual, or each successive generation of men, for He represents all men of every age, and therefore needed to die but once for all, so as to exhaust the penalty of death incurred by all. He was offered by the Father, His own "eternal Spirit" (Heb 9:14) concurring; as Abraham spared not Isaac, but offered him, the son himself unresistingly submitting to the father's will (Ge 22:1-24).<p>to bear the sins&#8212;referring to Isa 53:12, "He bare the sins of many," namely, on Himself; so "bear" means, Le 24:15; Nu 5:31; 14:34.

As man dies but once, Christ was offered but once, or he suffered and died but once; and that was not on his own account, or for his own sins, "but to bear the sins of many": not of angels but of men, and these not a few, but "many"; which is said to magnify the grace of God, to exalt the satisfaction and righteousness of Christ, and to encourage souls to hope in him: hence many are brought to believe in him, and many are justified by him, have their sins forgiven them, and are glorified; though Christ bore not the sins of all men; for as all men have not faith, all are not justified, pardoned, and saved: what he bore were "sins"; all kind of sin, every act of sin, and all that belongs to it; its filth, guilt, and punishment, even the iniquity of all his people; which must be a prodigious weight, and than which nothing could be more nauseous: his bearing them supposes they were upon him, though not in him, imputed, though not inherent; that he did not sink under them; that he made an entire satisfaction for them, and bore them wholly away, both from the persons of his people, and from the sight of justice. The way in which he came to bear them was this; he became a surety for all the elect; his Father imputed to him all their sins, and he voluntarily took them upon himself; where justice found them, and demanded satisfaction of him for them, and he gave it; which is an instance both of his great love, and of his great strength: <p>and unto them that look for him: with affection, faith and patience: <p>shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation; this is to be understood of Christ's visible and personal appearance on earth, which will be a glorious one; he will appear in his own glory, and in his Father's glory, and in the glory of the holy angels, and in the glory of his power, to the joy of saints, and to the terror of the wicked; for every eye shall see him: and this is said to be "the second time"; that is, that he appears on earth, and personally; for though he often appears to his people, it is in a spiritual way; and though he appeared to Stephen and to Paul, yet not on earth, but in heaven; and this is called the second time, with reference to his first appearance in human nature at his incarnation, and after that he ascended to heaven; and as this will be the second, it will be the last: the manner in which he will appear, will be, "without sin"; without sin itself; without any thing like it: without any infirmities, which though not sinful are the effects of sin; without sin imputed to him, with which he appeared before; without being a sacrifice for sin; and without sin upon his people that come with him, or he shall meet whom he shall raise, or change, and take to himself: and the end of his appearance with respect to them, will be "unto salvation"; the end of his first appearance was to obtain salvation for his people, and he has obtained it, and there is a comfortable application of it made unto them by the Spirit of God; but the full possession of it will be hereafter, and into this will Christ put them, when he shall appear: the Alexandrian copy adds, "by faith", and also some other copies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> many; <span class="cverse3">{16}</span> and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</span><p>(s) Thus the general promise is restrained to the elect only: and we have to seek the testimony of our election, not in the secret counsel of God, but in the effects that our faith works, and so we must climb up from the lowest step to the highest, there to find such comfort as is most certain, and shall never be moved.<p>(16) Shortly by the way he sets Christ as Judge, partly to terrify those who are not trusting in the only sacrifice of Christ once made, and partly to keep the faithful in their duty, so that they will not go back.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἅπαξ προσενεχθείς</span>] <span class="ital">once offered</span> (by the suffering of death).

From a linguistic point of view this interpretation encounters no difficulty (against Delitzsch and others), since the <span class="greekheb">ἀνά</span> in <span class="greekheb">ἀνενεγκεῖν</span> was employed not otherwise than, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, very frequently the <span class="greekheb">ἀνά</span> in <span class="greekheb">ἀναιρεῖν</span>. How easily the notion of <span class="ital">bearing</span> in <span class="greekheb">φέρειν</span> could pass over into that of <span class="ital">bearing away</span> or <span class="ital">doing away with</span>, is shown in the kindred verb <span class="greekheb">βαστάζειν</span>, which is unquestionably used, <a href="/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>, <a href="/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you?

According to Bleek, there arises a difficulty from the words, if we explain <span class="greekheb">προσενεχθείς</span> of the death suffered upon earth, and not, with him, of an action accomplished in heaven, only after the resurrection, inasmuch as in the former case Christ <span class="ital">already</span> appeared in a visible form the second time after His resurrection. But such difficulty does not at all present itself in connection with that application of <span class="greekheb">προσενεχθείς</span> either. For <span class="greekheb">ἐκ δευτέρου ὀφθήσεται</span> can only be understood of a second appearing in a visible form upon earth; when, however, Christ after His resurrection appeared again to His disciples, He had not yet left the earth; those manifestations of the risen Christ before His ascension belonged consequently to His first visible coming forth upon earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span>] forms the opposition to <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ πολλῶν ἀνενεγκεῖν ἁμαρτίας</span>, is therefore to be interpreted after the analogy of these words. (Erroneously Bleek, according to whom <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span> forms the opposition to <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀθέτησιν ἁμαρτίας διὰ τῆς θυσίας αὐτοῦ πεφανέρωται</span>, <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>.) Christ has once offered Himself up for the expiation of the sins of men; when He returns to earth the second time, He will not once more have to do with the expiation of human sin, but <span class="ital">He will, apart from sin, or free from all relation to sin, appear to bring the</span> <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> <span class="ital">to the believers</span>. Free from the guilt and punishment of sin, Christ <span class="ital">has</span> already rendered His believers by means of His sacrificial death at His first appearing upon earth. <span class="ital">Positively</span>, He will bless them with salvation at His return. To combine <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span> with <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀπεκδεχομένοις</span> by means of an hyperbaton (so Faber Stapulensis and Grotius) is grammatically impossible. The sense, however, cannot be either, as the Irvingites will, that <span class="ital">Christ Himself</span> will be free from sin at His second appearing, in opposition to the lust which they suppose to have attached to Him during His first appearing; for that Christ during this period too, notwithstanding all the temptation to which He was subject, was free from sin, the author certainly distinctly asserts at <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>. Incorrectly also does Bleek—after the example of Theodore of Mopsuestia (<span class="greekheb">τὸ γὰρ χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας τοῦτο λέγει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μὴ κρατούσης ἔτι τῆς ἁμαρτίας οὕτω καὶ αὐτὸς ἔξω παντὸς ἀνθρωπίνου πάθους ὀφθήσεται τότε</span>) and of Theodoret (<span class="greekheb">οὐκέτι τῆς ἁμαρτίας κρατούσης</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ τοῦ χώραν οὐκέτι ἐχούσης κατὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span>)—take <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span> as equivalent in signification to <span class="greekheb">μὴ οὔσης ἁμαρτίας</span>, so that the sense would be: “at the return of Christ sin will no longer be present, at least in the domain to which the operation of the Redeemer will relate.” Even in a grammatical respect this application of the words is inadmissible, since <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span> must stand in relation to the <span class="ital">subject</span> in <span class="greekheb">ὀφθήσεται</span>, thus cannot be torn away from this reference by being made equivalent to an independent participial clause. But also the thought thence arising would be encumbered with difficulty, as Bleek himself admits, by the addition of “at least,” etc., although Bleek has sought to justify it. Additional misinterpretations of <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span> are met with in other writers. Thus it is supposed to mean: without, again vicariously laden with the sins of men, being made sin (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>) for them (Oecumenius, Theophylact, Clarius, Akersloot, Wolf, Carpzov, Chr. Fr. Schmid, Heinrichs, de Wette, Bloomfield, Bisping, Delitzsch, Riehm, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 545, <span class="ital">Obs.</span>; Alford, Maier, Moll, and others), which is already refuted by the erroneousness of explaining the foregoing <span class="greekheb">ἀνενεγκεῖν</span> of the vicarious bearing of sins; without the punishment of sin (Klee, <span class="ital">al</span>.); without the sufferings undertaken for sin (Tholuck); sine corporis, peccato obnoxii, mortalitate (Zeger); sine sacrificio pro peccato (Jac. Cappellus, Stuart, M‘Caul, and many); not as a <span class="ital">sufferer</span> for the guilt of others, but as the holy <span class="ital">judge</span> of the guilt of others (Ebrard, Delitzsch; similarly Stein and others), and so forth, all of which have the plain expression of the language against them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς σωτηρίαν</span>] belongs to <span class="greekheb">ὀφθήσεται</span>, not, as it is true, upon the retention of the <span class="ital">spurious</span> addition (see the critical remark) <span class="greekheb">διὰ πίστεως</span>, it must be conjoined, to <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδεχομένοις</span> (so Primasius, Faber Stapulensis, Camerarius, Wolf, Klee, Paulus, Stein). For <span class="greekheb">τοῖς αὐτὸν ἀπεκδεχομένοις</span> contains a non-essential element of the statement, <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <span class="greekheb">εἰς σωτηρίαν</span>, on the other hand, an essential element of the same. <span class="greekheb">εἰς σωτηρίαν</span>, namely, is the positive nearer defining of the negative <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας</span>, and forms consequently, like the latter, an antithesis to <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ πολλῶν ἀνενεγκεῖν ἁμαρτίας</span>. The whole clause, however, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ δευτέρου</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς σωτηρίαν</span>, corresponds to the second member of the clause, <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27</a> : <span class="greekheb">μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο κρίσις</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>. The comparison extends to both terms, the once dying and the judgment. [<span class="ital">Cf.</span> Kübel, “die Korrespondenz ist nicht bloss die der gleichen Menschennatur, sondern das, dass mit dem Tod das, was das Leben bedeutet, abgeschlossen, fertigist”]. The results of the life are settled. And in Christ’s case the result is that He appears the second time without sin unto salvation, the sin having been destroyed by His death, <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ προσενεχθεὶς</span> corresponds to <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ ἀποθανεῖν</span> of <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27</a>. The passive is used to be more in keeping with the universal <span class="ital">law</span> expressed in <span class="greekheb">ἀπόκειται</span> of <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm" title="And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:">Hebrews 9:27</a>. Though the “offering” as we have seen includes both the death and the entrance into the Holiest with the blood, it is the death which is here prominent. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ πολλῶν ἀνενεγκεῖν ἁμαρτίας</span>, “to bear the sins of many”. Westcott says, “the burden which Christ took upon Him and bore to the cross was ‘the sins of many’ not, primarily, or separately from the sins, the punishment of sins.” But in what intelligible sense can sins be borne but by bearing their punishment? In <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, it is said “your sins shall be fed in the wilderness forty years <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀνοίσουσι τὴν πορνείαν ὑμῶν</span>, where the same verb is used as here to express the idea of suffering punishment for the sins of others, <span class="greekheb">πολλῶν</span>, although it was the death of but one, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:...">Romans 5:12-21</a>, but probably only a reminiscence of <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm" title="And they that shall be of you shall build the old waste places: you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.">Isaiah 58:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ἁμαρτίας πολλῶν ἀνήνεγκε</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ δευτέρου</span> … a second time He shall appear, <span class="greekheb">ὀφθήσεται</span>, visible to the eye.

Once for all One died for all who were “many” (see my <span class="ital">Life of St Paul</span>, ii. 216).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">without sin</span>] Not merely “without (<span class="greekheb">χωρὶς</span>)” but “apart from (<span class="greekheb">ἄτερ</span>) sin,” i.e. apart from all connexion with it, because He shall have utterly triumphed over, and annulled it (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm" title="For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.">Hebrews 9:26</a>); <a href="/context/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy....">Daniel 9:24-25</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/25-7.htm" title="And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations....">Isaiah 25:7-8</a>).

It is remarkable that the Sacred Writers—unlike the Mediæval painters and moralists—almost invariably avoid the more terrible aspects of the Second Advent. “How shall He appear?” asks St Chrysostom on this passage, “As a Punisher? He did not say this, but the bright side.” The parallelism of these verses is Man dies once, and is judged; Christ died once and shall return—he might have said “to be man’s <span class="ital">judge</span>” (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>)—but he does say “He shall return … for salvation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may sum up some of the contrasts of this previous chapter as follows. The descendants of Aaron were but priests; Christ, like Melchisedek, was both Priest and King. They were for a time; He is a Priest for ever. They were but links in a long succession, inheriting from forefathers, transmitting to dependents; He stands alone, without lineage, without successor. They were established by a transitory ordinance, He by an eternal oath. They were sinful, He is sinless. They weak, He all-powerful. Their sacrifices were ineffectual, His was perfect. Their sacrifices were offered daily, His once for all. Theirs did but cleanse from ceremonial defilement, His purged the conscience. Their tabernacle was but a copy, and their service a shadow; His tabernacle was the Archetype, and His service the substance. They died and passed away; He sits to intercede for us for ever at God’s right hand. Their Covenant is doomed to abrogation; His, founded on better promises, is to endure unto the End. Their High Priest could but enter once and that with awful precautions, with the blood of bulls and goats, into a material shrine; He, entering with the blood of His one perfect sacrifice into the Heaven of Heavens, has thrown open to all the right of continual and fearless access to God. What a sin then was it, and what a folly, to look back with apostatising glances at the shadows of a petty Levitism while Christ the Mediator of a New, of a better, of a final Dispensation—Christ whose blood had a real and no mere symbolic efficacy had died once for all, and Alone for all, as the sinless Son of God to obtain for us an eternal redemption, and to return for our salvation as the Everlasting Victor over sin and death!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὕτω</span>, so) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> Christ hath delivered us from death and judgment, notwithstanding that, as death, so also judgment remains, as far as the name is concerned.—<span class="greekheb">προσενεχθεὶς εἰς τὸ ἀνενεγκεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">having been offered to bear</span>) There is a difference between the words; comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἀνήνεγκεν</span>, <span class="ital">He bore our sins:</span> Our sins were laid on Him by the Father: while therefore He was lifted np on the cross, He bore (took) up our sins along with Him. The LXX. use the same expression, <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνοίσουσι τὴν πορνείαν ὑμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">they shall bear your whoredoms</span>. In other places they are put indiscriminately: ch. <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πολλῶν</span>, <span class="ital">of many</span>) A pleasant antithesis: <span class="ital">once; of many</span>, who lived during so many ages. <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>, in the LXX. version, <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸς ἁμαρτίας πολλῶν ἀνήνεγκε</span>, <span class="ital">and He bore the sins</span> (<span class="ital">sin</span>, Heb.) <span class="ital">of many</span>. Thus the absolute power of the one sacrifice of Christ is very clearly evinced. The word <span class="ital">again</span>, <a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>, accords with <span class="ital">a second time</span>, here. Both places treat of His coming, regarded as to itself (secundum se). But His coming, for the first time in the flesh, was in the strange form of a servant: His second coming is in His own glory. In the eyes of all, who had not formerly seen, [not only so] but had not either acknowledged Him, He is at that time <span class="ital">Coming</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>, The Comer). Let us suppose the arrival of a guest, the intimate friend of the father of the family, but unknown to the family.
