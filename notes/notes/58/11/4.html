Hence, apart from the first words, “by faith,” there is nothing here said to explain the superiority of Abel’s offering; though one who believes sacrifice to have been of Divine institution, and who notes the close connection between God’s word and the actions of the men whose faith is here recorded, may hold it probable that Abel’s obedience was manifested in his mode of approaching God.<p><span class= "bld">By which he obtained witness.</span>—Probably, “through which <span class= "ital">faith,” </span>but the Greek may also mean <span class= "ital">through which sacrifice.</span> The witness (<a href="/hebrews/11-2.htm" title="For by it the elders obtained a good report.">Hebrews 11:2</a>) is that borne by God in His acceptance of the offering (shown by some visible sign); we might also add that such a testimony to Abel is implied in the reproof of Cain (<a href="/genesis/4-7.htm" title="If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door.

And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.">Genesis 4:5</a>, we may believe it was by some outward visible sign. And as in after-times God testified his acceptance of particular sacrifices by sending down fire upon them to consume them, it is probable that he bore witness to Abel’s in that way, thus giving a token that justice seized on the sacrifice instead of the sinner. It is of importance to observe, that God’s acceptance of Abel’s sin-offering is a proof that propitiatory sacrifices were of divine appointment, otherwise his offering, being will-worship, must have been offensive to God, and rejected. Besides, as Hallet justly observes, flesh not being permitted to be eaten by men till after the flood, Abel must have thought it unlawful to kill any animal, unless God had ordered it to be killed as a sacrifice. <span class="ital">And by it</span> — By his faith; <span class="ital">he, being dead, yet speaketh </span>— That a sinner is accepted only through faith in the great Sacrifice.

Abel brought a sacrifice of atonement from the firstlings of the flock, acknowledging himself a sinner who deserved to die, and only hoping for mercy through the great Sacrifice. Cain's proud rage and enmity against the accepted worshipper of God, led to the awful effects the same principles have produced in every age; the cruel persecution, and even murder of believers. By faith Abel, being dead, yet speaketh; he left an instructive and speaking example. Enoch was translated, or removed, that he should not see death; God took him into heaven, as Christ will do the saints who shall be alive at his second coming. We cannot come to God, unless we believe that he is what he has revealed himself to be in the Scripture. Those who would find God, must seek him with all their heart. Noah's faith influenced his practice; it moved him to prepare an ark. His faith condemned the unbelief of others; and his obedience condemned their contempt and rebellion. Good examples either convert sinners or condemn them. This shows how believers, being warned of God to flee from the wrath to come, are moved with fear, take refuge in Christ, and become heirs of the righteousness of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By faith Abel offered - see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4-5</a>. In the account in Genesis of the offering made by Abel, there is no mention of "faith" - as is true also indeed of most of the instances referred to by the apostle. The account in Genesis is, simply, that Abel "brought of the firstlings of his flock, and the fat thereof, and that the Lord had respect to Abel and his offering." Men have speculated much as to the reason why the offering of Abel was accepted, and that of Cain rejected; but such speculation rests on no certain basis, and the solution of the apostle should be regarded as decisive and satisfactory, that in the one case there was faith, in the other not. It could not have been because an offering of the fruits of the ground was not pleasing to God, for such an offering was commanded under the Jewish Law, and was not in itself improper. Both the brothers selected what was to them most obvious; which they had reared with their own bands; which they regarded as most valuable.<p>Cain had cultivated the earth, and he naturally brought what had grown under his care; Abel kept a flock, and he as naturally brought what he had raised: and had the temper of mind in both been the same, there is no reason to doubt that the offering of each would have been accepted. To this conclusion we are led by the nature of the case, and the apostle advances substantially the same sentiment, for he says that the particular state of mind on which the whole turned was, that the one had faith, and the other not. "How" the apostle himself was informed of the fact that it was "faith" which made the difference, he has not informed us. The belief that he was inspired will, however, relieve the subject of this difficulty, for according to such a belief all his statements here, whether recorded in the Old Testament or not, are founded in truth. It is equally impossible to tell with "certainty" what was the nature of the faith of Abel. It has been commonly asserted, that it was faith in Christ - looking forward to his coming, and depending on his sacrifice when offering what was to he a type of him.<p>But of this there is no positive evidence, though from <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>, it seems to be not improbable. Sacrifice, as a type of the Redeemer's great offering, was instituted early in the history of the world. There can be no reason assigned for the offering of "blood" as an atonement for sin, except that it had originally a reference to the great atonement which was to be made by blood; and as the salvation of man depended on this entirely, it is probable that that would be one of the truths which would he first communicated to man after the fall. The bloody offering of Abel is the first of the kind which is definitely mentioned in the Scriptures (though it is not improbable that such sacrifices were offered by Adam, compare <a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>), and consequently Abel may be regarded "as the recorded head of the whole typical system, of which fist was the antitype and the fulfillment." Compare notes, <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>. "A more excellent sacrifice." &#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  Pleiona thusian - as rendered by Tyndale, "a more plenteous sacrifice;" or, as Wicklift renders it more literally, "a much more sacrifice;" that is, a more full or complete sacrifice; a better sacrifice. The meaning is, that it had in it much more to render it acceptable to God. In the estimate of its value, the views of him who offered it would be more to be regarded than the nature of the offering itself.<p>("By offering victims of the choice of his flock, Abel not only showed a more decided attachment to God, but there is great reason to suppose (as Abp. Magee on Atonement, p. 52, shows) that his faith was especially superior, as being not only directed to God alone (recognizing his existence, authority, and providence) but also to the Great Redeemer, promised immediately after the fall, <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> whose expiatory death was typified by animal sacrifice, by offering which Abel had evinced his faith in the great sacrifice of the Redeemer, prefigured by it: and then he obtained that acceptance from God, and witnessing of his offering, which was refused to Cain; see more in Macknight and Scott" - Bloomfield.<p>By which - By which sacrifice so offered. The way in which he obtained the testimony of divine approbation was by the sacrifice offered in this manner. It was not "merely" by faith, it was by the offering of a sacrifice in connection with, and under the influence of faith.<p>He obtained witness that he was righteous - That is, from God. His offering made in faith was the means of his obtaining the divine testimonial that he was a righteous man. Compare the notes on <a href="/hebrews/11-2.htm">Hebrews 11:2</a>. This is implied in what is said in <a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>. "And the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering;" that is, he regarded it as the offering of a righteous man.<p>God testifying of his gifts - In what way this was done is not mentioned either here or in Genesis. Commentators have usually supposed that it was by fire descending from heaven to consume the sacrifice. But there is no evidence of this, for there is no intimation of it in the Bible. It is true that this frequently occurred when an offering was made to God, (see <a href="/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>; <a href="/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>), but the sacred writers give us no hint that this happened in the case of the sacrifice made by Abel, and since it is expressly mentioned in other cases and not here, the presumption rather is that no such miracle occurred on the occasion. So remarkable a fact - the first one in all history if it were so - could hardly have failed to be noticed by the sacred writer. It seems to me, therefore, that there was some method by which God "testified" his approbation of the offering of AbeL which is unknown to us, but in regard to what it was conjecture is vain.<p>And by it he, being dead, yet speaketh - Margin, "Is yet spoken of." This difference of translation arises from a difference of reading in the mss. That from which the translation in the text is derived, is &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;  lalei - "he speaketh." That from which the rendering in the margin is derived, is &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  laleitai - "is being spoken of;" that is, is "praised or commended." The latter is the common reading in the Greek text, and is found in Walton, Wetstein, Matthzei, Titman, and Mill; the former is adopted by Griesbach, Koppe, Knapp, Grotius, Hammond, Storr, Rosenmuller, Prof. Stuart, Bloomfield, and Hahn, and is found in the Syriac and Coptic, and is what is favored by most of the Fathers. See "Wetstein." The authority of manuscripts is in favor of the reading &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  laleitai - "is spoken of." It is impossible, in this variety of opinion, to determine which is the true reading, and this is one of the cases where the original text must probably be forever undecided.<p>Happily no important doctrine or duty is depending on it. Either of the modes of reading will give a good sense. The apostle is saying that it is by faith that the "elders have obtained a good report" (<a href="/hebrews/11-2.htm">Hebrews 11:2</a>); he had said (<a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>), that it was by faith that Abel obtained the testimony of God in his favor, and if the reading "is spoken of" be adopted, the apostle means that in consequence of that offering thus made, Abel continued even to his time to receive an honorable mention. This act was commended still; and the "good report" of which it had been the occasion, had been transmitted from age to age. A sentiment thus of great beauty and value may be derived from the passage - that true piety is the occasion of transmitting a good report - or an honorable reputation, even down to the latest generation. It is what will embalm the memory in the grateful recollection of mankind; that on which they will reflect with pleasure, and which they will love to transmit to future ages. But after all, it seems to me to be probable that the true sentiment in this passage is what is expressed in the common version, "he yet speaketh." The reasons are briefly these:<p>(1) The authority of manuscripts, versions, editions, and critics, is so nearly equal, that it is impossible from this source to determine the true reading, and we must, therefore, form our judgment from the connection.<p>(2) the apostle had twice in this verse expressed substantially the idea that he was honorably testified of by his faith, and it is hardly probable that he would again repeat it so soon.<p>(3) there seems to be an allusion here to the "language" used respecting Abel <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground;" or utters a distinct voice - and the apostle seems to design to represent Abel as still speaking.<p>(4) in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>, he represents both Abel and Christ as still "speaking" - as if Abel continued to utter a voice of admonition. The reference there is to the fact that he continued to proclaim from age to age, even to the time of the apostle, the great truth that salvation was only "by blood." He had proclaimed it at first by his faith when he offered the sacrifice of the lamb; he continued to speak from generation to generation, and to show that it was one of the earliest principles of religion that there could be redemption from sin in no other way.<p>(5) the expression "yet speaketh" accords better with the connection. The other interpretation is cold compared with this, and less fits the case before us. On the faith of Noah, Abraham, and Moses, it might be said with equal propriety that it is still commended or celebrated as well as that of Abel, but the apostle evidently means to say that there was a voice in that of Abel which was special; there was something in "his" life and character which continued to speak from age to age. His sacrifice, his faith, his death, his blood, all continued to lift up the voice, and to proclaim the excellence and value of confidence in God, and to admonish the world how to live.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. more excellent sacrifice&#8212;because offered in faith. Now faith must have some revelation of God on which it fastens. The revelation in this case was doubtless God's command to sacrifice animals ("the firstlings of the flock") in token of the forfeiture of men's life by sin, and as a type of the promised bruiser of the serpent's head (Ge 3:15), the one coming sacrifice: this command is implied in God's having made coats of skin for Adam and Eve (Ge 3:21): for these skins must have been taken from animals slain in sacrifice: inasmuch as it was not for food they were slain, animal food not being permitted till after the flood; nor for mere clothing, as, were it so, clothes might have been made of the fleeces without the needless cruelty of killing the animal; but a coat of skin put on Adam from a sacrificed animal typified the covering or atonement (the Hebrew for atone means to cover) resulting from Christ's sacrifice. The Greek is more literally rendered [Kennicott] by Wycliffe, "a much more sacrifice"; and by Queen Elizabeth's version "a greater sacrifice." A fuller, more ample sacrifice, that which partook more largely and essentially of the true nature and virtue of sacrifice [Archbishop Magee]. It was not any intrinsic merit in "the firstling of the flock" above "the fruit of the ground." It was God's appointment that gave it all its excellency as a sacrifice; if it had not been so, it would have been a presumptuous act of will-worship (Col 2:23), and taking of a life which man had no right over before the flood (Ge 9:1-6). The sacrifice seems to have been a holocaust, and the sign of the divine acceptance of it was probably the consumption of it by fire from heaven (Ge 15:17). Hence, "to accept" a burnt sacrifice is in Hebrew "to turn it to ashes" (Ps 20:3, Margin). A flame seems to have issued from the Shekinah, or flaming cherubim, east of Eden ("the presence of the Lord," Ge 4:16), where the first sacrifices were offered. Cain, in unbelieving self-righteousness, presented merely a thank offering, not like Abel feeling his need of the propitiatory sacrifice appointed on account of sin. God "had respect (first) unto Abel, and (then) to his offering" (Ge 4:4). Faith causes the believer's person to be accepted, and then his offering. Even an animal sacrifice, though of God's appointment, would not have been accepted, had it not been offered in faith.<p>he obtained witness&#8212;God by fire attesting His acceptance of him as "righteous by faith."<p>his gifts&#8212;the common term for sacrifices, implying that they must be freely given.<p>by it&#8212;by faith exhibited in his animal sacrifice.<p>dead, yet speaketh&#8212;His blood crying front the ground to God, shows how precious, because of his "faith," he was still in God's sight, even when dead. So he becomes a witness to us of the blessed effects of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Spirit beginneth here to illustrate his description of faith, by induction of instances throughout the former ages of the church to the time of these Hebrews; and he begins with believers in the old world before the flood.

The apostle proceeds to examples of faith, and begins with Abel: it may seem strange that Adam and Eve are not mentioned; this omission is not because they were not believers; but either because of the fall and ruin of mankind by them; or because the apostle speaks only of such who had received some eminent testimony by faith, and therefore passes by many believers, and hastens to Abraham, the father of the Jews. The superior excellency of Abel's sacrifice to Cain's, lay both in the matter, and in the manner of it; the one was offered heartily to the Lord, the other only in show; the one was offered in faith, the other not; Abel looked through his sacrifice to the sacrifice of Christ, not so Cain. Abel's sacrifice was a lamb, a type of Christ, the Lamb of God; a firstling, a figure of him who is the firstborn of every creature; one of the fattest of his flock, expressive of the excellency of Christ; and this was offered up at the end of days, as Christ at the end of the world; and the superior excellency of the sacrifice of the one to that of the other, appears from God's regard to the one, and not to the other, <a href="/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a> from whence it may be observed, that sacrifices were of divine institution, and were very early types of Christ; and that there always were two sorts of worshippers, spiritual and carnal ones, whom God can distinguish, for he seeth not as man seeth; that the acceptance of persons is in Christ, and is previous to their offerings; that whatsoever works do not spring from faith are unacceptable to God; that no dependence is to be had on birth privileges, or outward actions; and that electing and distinguishing grace very early took place, and appeared. <p>By which he obtained witness that he was righteous; not righteous by his offering, nor by his faith, but by the righteousness of Christ, which his faith in his sacrifice looked unto; though it was by his faith that he obtained, or received a witness in his own conscience, from the Spirit of God, testifying that he was a justified person; and in consequence of this, he had an outward testimony bore to him in the Scriptures, that he was a righteous person hence he is called righteous Abel, <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>. <p>God testifying of his gifts: not of his own gifts, temporal or spiritual, but of Abel's gifts, which he offered to the Lord; that is, his sacrifices; of these he testified, when he showed respect either by an audible voice, declaring his acceptance of them; or by sending down fire from heaven, upon his sacrifice, which in later times was a symbol of acceptance. <p>And by it, he being dead, yet speaketh; good men die, and some of them die a violent death, as did Abel, yet he speaks in the Scriptures, which have a voice in them, <a href="/luke/16-29.htm">Luke 16:29</a> or by his blood, which calls for vengeance; or rather by, or because of his faith, though he is dead, "he is yet spoken of", as the word may be rendered. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</span><p>(4) Abel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>. <span class="ital">The example of Abel</span>.

In addition to the ordinary one, <span class="ital">this</span> explanation also is proposed by Oecumenius, in referring the pronoun back to the <span class="greekheb">θυσία</span> by which the violent death of Abel was occasioned; it is followed by Bengel, with the difference that he supplements <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτῆς</span> by <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>, and will have <span class="greekheb">διά</span> taken in the sense of <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔτι</span>] is not the <span class="ital">temporal: still, adhuc</span> (Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">μέχρι τοῦ παρόντος</span>), so that <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖ</span> would signify: he speaks to us of himself and his faith or piety (Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ ἔτι λαλεῖ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀοίδιμός ἐστι μέχρι τοῦ παρόντος καὶ πολυθρύλλητος καὶ παρὰ πάντων εὐφημεῖται τῶν εὐσεβῶν</span>; Heinsius, Bengel: loquitur de se et sui similibus contra Cainos, <span class="ital">al</span>.), or: he summons posterity to the imitation of his faith (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">ὁ γὰρ παραινῶν τοῖς ἄλλοις δικαίοις εἶναι</span>, <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖ</span>; Cornelius a Lapide, Valckenaer, Kuinoel, Paulus, Klee, Bloomfield, and others). Rather is <span class="greekheb">ἔτι</span> employed, as <a href="/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a> and frequently, in the <span class="ital">logical</span> sense, and serves for the emphasizing of the contrast: “even being dead,” or: “notwithstanding he is dead, he nevertheless speaks,” while <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖ</span> is to be regarded as the more vividly descriptive <span class="ital">pracsens historicum</span> (Winer, <span class="ital">Gramm.</span>, 7 Aufl. p. 250), and is to be referred to the thought that the shed blood of Abel called to God for vengeance, and God, listening to this cry, was concerned about the slain Abel, as though he were still living. For manifestly, as appears also from the parallel <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>, there is an allusion in <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖ</span> to the words, <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm" title="And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.">Genesis 4:10</a> : <span class="greekheb">φωνὴ αἵματος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου βοᾷ πρός με ἐκ τῆς γῆς</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm" title="By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.">Hebrews 11:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">πίστει πλείονα θυσίαν</span>.… “By faith Abel offered to God a more adequate sacrifice than Cain.” <span class="greekheb">πλείονα</span> literally “more,” but frequently used to express “higher in value” “greater in worth,” as in <a href="/context/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here....">Matthew 12:41-42</a>. <span class="greekheb">πλεῖον Ἰωνᾶ ὧδε</span>, <a href="/luke/12-23.htm" title="The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.">Luke 12:23</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-19.htm" title="I know your works, and charity, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.">Revelation 2:19</a>. Does the writer mean that faith prompted Abel to make a richer sacrifice, or that it was richer because offered in faith? Many interpreters prefer the former alternative; [“Der grössere Wert seines Opfers ruhte auf dem Glauben, der Herzenshingabe, die ihn das Beste der Herde wählen liess” (Kübel).] and the choice of the word <span class="greekheb">πλείονα</span> is certainly in favour of this interpretation. <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἧδ ἐμαρτυρήθη</span> … “through which he was certified [or attested] as righteous”. It is questioned whether <span class="greekheb">ἧς</span> is the relative of <span class="greekheb">θυσίαν</span> or of <span class="greekheb">πίστει</span>. The succeeding clause which states the ground of the attestation, <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δώροις</span>, determines that it refers to <span class="greekheb">θυσίαν</span>. God bore witness <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τοῖς δώροις αὐτοῦ</span>, which is explained in <a href="/genesis/4-4.htm" title="And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering:">Genesis 4:4</a> where it says <span class="greekheb">ἐπεῖδεν ὁ θεὸς ἐπὶ Ἄβελ καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς δώροις αὐτοῦ</span>. God looked favourably on Abel and on his gifts. How this favourable reception of his offering was intimated to Abel we are not told; but by this testimony Abel was pronounced <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>, not “justified” in the Pauline sense but in the general sense “a righteous man”; as in <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a> <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος Ἄβελ τοῦ δικαίου</span>. But this is not all that faith did for Abel, for <span class="greekheb">καὶ διʼ αὐτῆς ἀποθανὼν ἔτι λαλεῖ</span>, “and through the same he, though dead, yet speaks,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, speaks notwithstanding death. His death was not the end of him as Cain expected it to be. Abel’s blood cried for justice. The words of <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a> are at once suggested, <span class="greekheb">αἵματι ῥαντισμοῦ f1κρεῖττον λαλοῦντι παρὰ τὸν Ἄβελ</span>, where the blood of sprinkling is said to speak to better purpose than the blood of Abel. This again takes us back to <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm" title="And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.">Genesis 4:10</a>. “The voice of thy brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.” The speaking referred to, therefore, is not the continual voice of Abel’s example but the voice of his blood crying to God immediately after his death. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/psalms/9-12.htm" title="When he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers them: he forgets not the cry of the humble.">Psalm 9:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-15.htm" title="Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.">Psalm 116:15</a>. “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.” In the case of Abel, then, the excellence of faith was illustrated in two particulars, it prompted him to offer a richer, more acceptable offering, and it found for him a place in God’s regard even after his death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">By faith Abel</span>] Intending, so to speak, “to pluck only the flowers which happen to come within his reach, while he leaves the whole meadow full to his readers,” he begins to cull his instances from the world before the flood.

These are, therefore, first adduced with the view of showing that it is in respect of faith that they are thus distinguished in the sacred record. With respect to Abel, it is not necessary to inquire or conjecture whether the bloody character of his offering is to be considered as constituting its superior excellence. The record in Genesis simply represents the two brothers as offering each what he had to offer in accordance with his occupation and pursuits, the only difference being that Abel is said to, have offered <span class="accented">his firstlings</span> and the fat thereof, while nothing is said of Cain having brought his first fruits or his best. Then, in the account of the result, we are only told that unto one the LORD had respect, and not to the other, without mention of the reason why. It is usual to find a reason in the nature of Abel's offering as signifying atonement, and to suppose his faith manifested in his recognition of the need of such atonement, signified to him, as has been further supposed, by Divine command. This view of the intention of the narrative is indeed suggested by the description of what his offering was, viewed in the light of subsequent sacrificial theory; but it is not apparent in the narrative taken by itself, or in the reference to it in the passage before us. The acceptableness of the offering is here simply attributed, as of necessity, to the faith of the offerer, without any intimation of how that faith had been evinced. And with this view of the matter agrees the record itself, where it is said that "unto Abel and his offering the LORD had respect;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Abel first, and then to his offering - the offering was accepted because Abel was, not Abel on account of his kind of offering. "Crone quod datur Deo ex dantis mente pensatur... Neque enim sacrum eloquimn dicit, Respexit ad munera Abel et ad Cain mqnera non respexit, sed prius air quid respexit ad Abel, ac deinde subjunxit, 'et ad munera ejus.' Idcirco non Abel ex muneribus, sed ex Abel munera oblata placuerunt" (St. Gregory, quoted by Delitzsch). "And he being dead," etc., refers plainly to <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." The same voice of innocent blood, which appealed at the beginning of human history to the God of righteousness, cries still through all the ages; it sounds in our own cars now, telling us that faith prevails on high, and that "right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints." Cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> for an allusion again to the cry of the blood of Abel. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is there also used, supporting the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, rather than the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the Textus Receptus here. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Abel offered unto God (&#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>For the phrase see <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>.<p>A more excellent sacrifice (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Greater in value in God's eyes.

In Paul never in this sense. Others explain a more abundant sacrifice, referring to the material character of the offerings. See <a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>.
