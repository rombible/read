The first place is not given to “the elders,” for the writer’s object is to set forth the achievements of <span class= "ital">faith.</span> With these, he would say, the Scripture record is filled. Even where there is no mention of this principle we must trace it in the lives of God’s servants; even where there is no history of men, there is a necessity for the exercise of faith by ourselves, and the first words of Scripture teach this lesson.<p><span class= "bld">That the worlds were framed.</span>—Literally, that <span class= "ital">the ages have been prepared.</span> The remarkable expression which was used in <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a> is here repeated. The complete preparation of all that the successive periods of time contain is the idea which the words present. The narrative of the first chapter of Genesis ascribes the whole creation of “the heaven and the earth” to God; and associates with “a word of God” every stage in the preparation and furnishing of the earth. (See Note on <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.) This is the first lesson of that record. But it does not stand alone, as is taught more plainly still by the next clause.<p><span class= "bld">So that things which are seen.</span>—A slight alteration in the Greek is necessary here—“the thing seen” (or “what is seen”) being the true reading. A more important point is a change in the aspect of the whole clause, which the Greek seems to require. As the English words stand, they point out the significance of the statement of Scripture respecting the creative act: we believe the writer intended rather <span class= "ital">to</span> state the divine <span class= "ital">purpose</span> in relation to that first creation and all subsequent acts that are included in the “preparing of the ages.” “In order that what is seen should not have come into being out of things which appear.” This is probably the true meaning of the clause. In the narrative of the first chapter of Genesis God would have us learn a lesson for the whole course of human history and development. As the visible universe did not take its being out of what was apparent, so what from time to time is seen does not arise of itself out of what is manifest to man’s natural perceptions. Not only is the eternity of matter denied, but from the beginning a warning has been given against a materialistic philosophy. The first page of Scripture is designed to teach the constant presence and work of the Creator. This lesson we learn and apply by faith; and the result of its application is seen in many points of the history which follows. In that history the operation of faith is twofold. The writer’s most obvious design is to call attention to the faith possessed by “the elders,” and its wonderful triumphs; but it is in many cases by the same faith that we interpret the Scripture record so as to discover this to have been their guiding principle. But seldom does the Old Testament directly speak of faith, and hence the importance of this verse (which some have thought incongruous, since it retards the exhibition of the elders’ faith) as throwing light on our interpretation of the teaching of God’s word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Through faith we understand that the worlds </span>— Although the expression, <span class="greekheb">τους αιωνας</span>, generally signifies <span class="ital">the ages, </span>yet here the subsequent clause determines its signification to the material fabric of the world, comprehending the sun, moon, and stars, &c., (called by Moses the heaven and the earth, <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>,) by whose duration and revolutions time, consisting of days, months, years, and ages, is measured; <span class="ital">were framed </span>— <span class="ital">Formed, fashioned, </span>and <span class="ital">finished, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">κατηρτισθαι </span>implies, properly signifying to place the parts of any body or machine in their right order, <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>.

And that it here signifies, not merely the orderly disposition of the parts of the universe, but their production, is plain from the following clause. <span class="ital">By the word of God </span>— The sole command of God, without any instrument or preceding matter. The word <span class="greekheb">ρημα</span>, here used, properly signifies <span class="ital">a word spoken, </span>or <span class="ital">a command. </span>It is nowhere used in Scripture to denote the Son of God. His proper title is <span class="greekheb">ο λογος</span>, <span class="ital">the Word. </span>That the worlds were made by the <span class="ital">word, </span>order, or command of God, is one of the unseen things which cannot be known but by divine revelation. The apostle, therefore, doubtless refers to the Mosaic account of the creation, <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm" title="And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.">Genesis 1:3</a>, &c., where Moses informs us, <span class="ital">God said, let there be light, and there was light, </span>&c. As the creation is the fountain and specimen of the whole divine economy, so faith in the Creator is the foundation and specimen of all faith; <span class="ital">so that the things which are seen </span>— The earth and heavens, with all that they contain; <span class="ital">were not made of things which do appear </span>— Or, <span class="ital">of things appearing, </span>or <span class="ital">which did appear, </span>as <span class="greekheb">φαινομενων </span>may be properly rendered; that is, they were not made of any pre-existing matter, but of matter which God created and formed into the things which we see; and having formed them, he placed them in the beautiful order which they now hold, and impressed on them the motions proper to each, which they have retained ever since. “This account of the origin of things, given by revelation, is very different from the cosmogony of the heathen philosophers, who generally held that the matter of which the worlds were composed was uncreated and eternal; consequently, being independent of God, and not obedient to his will, they supposed it to be the occasion of all the evil that is in the world. But revelation, which teaches us that the things which are seen were not made of matter which did appear before they were made, but of matter which God had brought into existence; by thus establishing the sovereignty of God over matter, hath enlarged our ideas of his power, and strengthened our faith in his promises concerning the felicity of good men in the life to come. For the creation of the new heavens and the new earth, and the glories of the city of the living God, do not, in order to their formation, require more power than the creation of the present universe; and therefore, if we believe that the worlds were formed by the word of God from nothing, every other exercise of faith will be easy to us.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-3 Faith always has been the mark of God's servants, from the beginning of the world. Where the principle is planted by the regenerating Spirit of God, it will cause the truth to be received, concerning justification by the sufferings and merits of Christ. And the same things that are the object of our hope, are the object of our faith. It is a firm persuasion and expectation, that God will perform all he has promised to us in Christ. This persuasion gives the soul to enjoy those things now; it gives them a subsistence or reality in the soul, by the first-fruits and foretastes of them. Faith proves to the mind, the reality of things that cannot be seen by the bodily eye. It is a full approval of all God has revealed, as holy, just, and good. This view of faith is explained by many examples of persons in former times, who obtained a good report, or an honourable character in the word of God. Faith was the principle of their holy obedience, remarkable services, and patient sufferings. The Bible gives the most true and exact account of the origin of all things, and we are to believe it, and not to wrest the Scripture account of the creation, because it does not suit with the differing fancies of men. All that we see of the works of creation, were brought into being by the command of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed - The first instance of the strength of faith which the apostle refers to is that by which we give credence to the declarations in the Scriptures about the work of creation; <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. This is selected first, evidently because it is the first thing that occurs in the Bible, or is the first thing there narrated in relation to which there is the exercise of faith. He points to no particular instance in which this faith was exercised - for none is especially mentioned - but refers to it as an illustration of the nature of faith which every one might observe in himself. The "faith" here exercised is confidence in the truth of the divine declarations in regard to the creation. The meaning is, that our knowledge on this subject is a mere matter of faith in the divine testimony. It is not that we could "reason" this out, and demonstrate that the worlds were thus made; it is not that profane history goes back to that period and informs us of it; it is simply that God has told us so in his word. The "strength" of the faith in this case is measured:<p>(1) by the fact that it is mere faith - that there is nothing else on which to rely in the case, and,<p>(2) by the greatness of the truth believed.<p>After all the acts of faith which have ever been exercised in this world, perhaps there is none which is really more strong, or which requires higher confidence in God, than the declaration that this vast universe has been brought into existence by a word!<p>We understand - We attain to the apprehension of; we receive and comprehend the idea. Our knowledge of this fact is derived only from faith, and not from our own reasoning.<p>That the worlds - In <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, it is "the heaven and the earth." The phrase which the apostle uses denotes a plurality of worlds, and is proof that he supposed there were other worlds besides our earth. How far his knowledge extended on this point, we have no means of ascertaining, but there is no reason to doubt that he regarded the stars as "worlds" in some respects like our own. On the meaning of the Greek word used here, see the notes on <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>. The plural form is used there also, and in both cases, it seems to me, not without design.<p>Were framed - It is observable that the apostle does not here use the word "make or create." That which he does use - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  katartizo&#772; - means to put in order, to arrange, to complete, and may be applied to that which before had an existence, and which is to be put in order, or re-fitted; <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>; <a href="/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-6.htm">Matthew 21:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>. The meaning here is, that they "were set in order" by the Word of God. This implies the act of creation, but the specific idea is that of "arranging" them in the beautiful order in which they are now. Doddridge renders it "adjusted." Kuinoel, however, supposes that the word is used here in the sense of "form, or make." It has probably about the meaning which we attach to the phrase "fitting up anything," as, for example, a dwelling, and includes all the previous arrangements, though the thing which is particularly denoted is not the making, but the arrangemenent. So in the work here referred to. "We arrive at the conviction that the universe was prepared or arranged in the present manner by the Word of God."<p>By the word of God - This does not mean here, by the "Logos," or the second person of the Trinity, for Paul does not use that term here or elsewhere. The word which he employs is &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  re&#772;ma - "rema" - meaning properly a word spoken, and in this place "command;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>, <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>. "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." In regard to the agency of the Son of God in the work of the creation, see the notes on <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; compare the notes on <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>.<p>So that things which are seen - The point of the remark here is, that the visible creation was not moulded out of pre-existing materials, but was made out of nothing. In reference to the grammatical construction of the passage, see Stuart, Commentary in loc. The doctrine taught is, that matter was not eternal; that the materials of the universe, as well as the arrangement, were formed by God, and that all this was done by a simple command. The "argument" here, so far as it is adapted to the purpose of the apostle, seems to be, that there was nothing which "appeared," or which was to be "seen," that could lay the foundation of a belief that God made the worlds; and in like manner our faith now is not to be based on what; "appears," by which we could infer or reason out what would be, but that we must exercise strong confidence in Him who had power to create the universe out of nothing. If this vast universe has been called into existence by the mere word of God, there is nothing which we may not believe he has ample power to perform. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. we understand&#8212;We perceive with our spiritual intelligence the fact of the world's creation by God, though we see neither Him nor the act of creation as described in Ge 1:1-31. The natural world could not, without revelation, teach us this truth, though it confirms the truth when apprehended by faith (Ro 1:20). Adam is passed over in silence here as to his faith, perhaps as being the first who fell and brought sin on us all; though it does not follow that he did not repent and believe the promise.<p>worlds&#8212;literally, "ages"; all that exists in time and space, visible and invisible, present and eternal.<p>framed&#8212;"fitly formed and consolidated"; including the creation of the single parts and the harmonious organization of the whole, and the continual providence which maintains the whole throughout all ages. As creation is the foundation and a specimen of the whole divine economy, so faith in creation is the foundation and a specimen of all faith [Bengel].<p>by the word of God&#8212;not here, the personal word (Greek, "logos," Joh 1:1) but the spoken word (Greek, "rhema"); though by the instrumentality of the personal word (Heb 1:2).<p>not made, &c.&#8212;Translate as Greek, "so that not out of things which appear hath that which is seen been made"; not as in the case of all things which we see reproduced from previously existing and visible materials, as, for instance, the plant from the seed, the animal from the parent, &c., has the visible world sprung into being from apparent materials. So also it is implied in the first clause of the verse that the invisible spiritual worlds were framed not from previously existing materials. Bengel explains it by distinguishing "appear," that is, begin to be seen (namely, at creation), from that which is seen as already in existence, not merely beginning to be seen; so that the things seen were not made of the things which appear," that is, which begin to be seen by us in the act of creation. We were not spectators of creation; it is by faith we perceive it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This proves the second part of faith’s description, <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a></span>, that it is <span class="ital">the evidence of things not seen; </span> for by it only we understand the creation, which no eye saw. It is the same Divine faith as described before, but as evidencing invisible truths, it communicates a marvellous light to the understanding, and leaves real impressions of it from the word of God, whereby it arriveth unto a most certain knowledge of what is above the power of natural reason to convey, and gives a divine assent to it, such its as is real, clear, sure, and fruitful, different from that of the Gentiles, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them....">Romans 1:19-23</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The worlds; </span> touv aiwnav the word noteth sometimes ages, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a></span>; the garb and corrupt habit of men who live in them, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a></span>; eternity: but there, as <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a></span>, it is a word of aggregation, signifying all kinds of creatures, with their several places, times, and periods; things celestial, terrestrial, and subterrestrial; angels, men, and all sorts of creatures, together with all the states and conditions in which they were made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Were framed by the word of God; </span> heaven, earth, and seas, with all their hosts of creatures, the visible creation and the invisible world, were put into being and existence, placed in their proper order, disposed and fitted to their end, by the mighty word of God: Trinity in Unity the Creator, his powerful fiat, without any pain, or trouble, or assisting causes, instantly effected this miraculous, glorious work; <span class="ital">He spake, and it was done, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm" title="And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.">Genesis 1:3</a>,6,9,11,14</span>, &c.; <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>,9</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear; </span> the visible world, and all visible in it, were made all of nothing; this reason could never digest.

The celestial world, with its inhabitants, the angels; the starry and ethereal worlds, with all that is in them, the sun, moon, stars, and fowls of the air; the terrestrial world, with all upon it, men, beasts, &amp;c. and the watery world, the sea, and all that is therein: perhaps some respect may be had to the distinction of worlds among the Jews; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, though the apostle can scarce be thought to have any regard to their extravagant notions of vast numbers of worlds being created: they often speak of three hundred and ten worlds, in all which, they say, there are heavens, earth, stars, planets, &amp;c. (f); and sometimes of eighteen thousand (g); but these notions are rightly charged by Philo (h) with ignorance and folly. However, as many worlds as there are, they are made "by the Word of God"; by Christ, the essential Word of God, to whom the creation of all things is ascribed in <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. And this agrees with the sentiments of the Jews, who ascribe the creation of all things to the Word of God, as do the Targumists (i), and Philo the Jew (k). And these are "framed" by the Word, in a very beautiful and convenient order; the heavens before the earth; things less perfect, before those that were more so in the visible world, or terraqueous globe; and things for men, before men, for whom they were; and it is by divine revelation and faith that men form right notions of the creation, and of the author of it, and particularly of the origin of it, as follows: <p>so that things which are seen: as the heaven, earth, and sea, and in which the invisible things of God, the perfections of his nature, are discerned: <p>were not made of things which do appear; they were not made from pre-existent matter, but out of nothing, out of which the rude and undigested chaos was formed; and from that invisible mass, covered with darkness, were all visible things brought into a beautiful order; and all from secret and hidden ideas in the divine minds; and this also is the faith of the Jews, that the creation of all things is  "out of nothing" (l). There seems to be an allusion to the word  used for creation, which signifies to make appear a thing unseen; and is rendered in the Septuagint version by  <a href="/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a> and   <a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a> to show, or make appear; and thus God created, or made to appear, the heavens and earth, which before were not in being, and unseen, <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a> and created to make, as in <a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a> that is, made them to appear, that he might put them into the form and order they now are. <p>(f) Misn.

Schmid, Bengel, Storr, Schulz, Huët, Böhme, Stuart, Bleek, Stein, de Wette, Bloomfield, Bisping, Riehm [<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 58), Alford, Maier, Kluge, Moll, Kurtz, M‘Caul, and Hofmann; while the Peshito, Vulgate, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, and almost all later expositors, including also Stengel and Ebrard (Delitzsch is undecided), comprehend <span class="greekheb">μή</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐκ φαινομένων</span>, and then interpret this in the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἐκ μὴ φαινομένων</span>.[106] The latter, in favour of which the supposed parallels which have been adduced prove nothing, is by reason of the position of the words (to say nothing of the fact that <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> must have been written in place of <span class="greekheb">μή</span>; for neither <a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>, as Delitzsch supposes, nor <a href="/romans/4-17.htm" title="(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.">Romans 4:17</a>, as Maier supposes, decides against this rule.

The expression indicates the domain of the corporal, the material, and there underlies it the conception that the universe did not spring forth by the power of nature from earthly germs or substances, but was created by the mere word of God’s omnipotence. In this is contained, it is true, the conception of the creating of the world from nothing. [Cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-28.htm" title="I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.">2Ma 7:28</a>.] The opinion of Estius, Schlichting, Limborch, Michaelis, Baumgarten, and others, that the author, with a reference to <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm" title="And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.">Genesis 1:2</a> (specially after the translation of the LXX.: <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ γῆ ἦν ἀόρατος καὶ ἀκατασκεύαστος</span>), thought of a visible arising of the worlds out of the invisible chaos already existing, has for its presupposition the erroneous transposal of the <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐκ</span> into <span class="greekheb">ἐκ μή</span>, and fails to maintain itself in presence of the fact that the <span class="greekheb">γεγονέναι ἐκ φαινομένων</span>, as antithesis to the foregoing <span class="greekheb">κατηρτίσθαι ῥήματι θεοῦ</span>, must receive from this latter its nearer defining of signification. Quite untenable is consequently also the opinion of Delitzsch, who, with the assent of Kluge and Kurtz, supplements <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐκ νοητῶν</span> as opposition to <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐκ φαινομένων</span>, and in connection with the <span class="greekheb">μὴ φαινόμενα</span>—or if <span class="greekheb">μή</span> is combined with the verb, in connection with the tacitly assumed opposite of the <span class="greekheb">φαινόμενα</span>—imagines the author to have thought, in harmony with the Philonian doctrine, <span class="ital">of the divine ideas</span>, out of which the world is supposed to have sprung, in that they were called forth by means of the divine word from their seclusion within the Godhead into the outer phenomenal reality.

It says that the world was made out of nothing, not out of the primeval chaos. So in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/7-28.htm" title="I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.">2Ma 7:28</a> the mother begs her son “to look upon the heaven and earth and all that is therein, and consider that God made them <span class="ital">out of things that are not</span>” (<span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων</span>). If this view be correct, the writer would seem purposely to avoid Philo’s way of saying that the world was made out of <span class="greekheb">τὰ μὴ ὄντα</span>, “things conceived as non-existent,” by which he meant the “formless matter” (as in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/11-17.htm" title="For thy Almighty hand, that made the world of matter without form, wanted not means to send among them a multitude of bears or fierce lions,">Wis 11:17</a>). He says that the world did not originate from <span class="ital">anything</span> phenomenal. This verse, so far from being superfluous, or incongruous with what follows, strikes the keynote of faith by shewing that its first object must be a Divine and Infinite Creator. Thus like Moses in Genesis 1 the verse excludes from the region of faith all Atheism, Pantheism, Polytheism, and Dualism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πίστει</span>, <span class="ital">by faith</span>) To a certain extent also without faith, <a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>; but much more by faith, which, for example, is put (has scope for exercise), in ch. 1 of Genesis.—<span class="greekheb">νοοῦμεν</span>, <span class="ital">we understand</span>) The <span class="ital">Elders</span>, of whom mention is on that account previously made in the second verse, also <span class="ital">understood</span> it. Adam also, who was created after all the rest, understood what he did not see done, but believed to have been done; but concerning his faith, Moses maintains a very mysterious silence; and the apostle follows Moses, except that, in mentioning these things before the sacrifice of Abel, he virtually recognises the faith of those who were first created.

A grand plural, in which is intimated the course onward to the goal of the heaven and the earth, and all things which are in them, visible and invisible, and, subsequently, their everlasting condition when their course is terminated; and whatever change may at length take place, accompanying the termination. And as creation is the foundation and exhibition (a specimen) of the whole Divine economy, so faith in creation is the foundation and exhibition (a specimen) of all faith.—<span class="greekheb">ῥήματι</span>, <span class="ital">by the word</span>) by the command, by the power, without matter or instrument. This accords with what immediately follows.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ</span>) <span class="ital">so that</span>.

Even without a revelation to declare this, faith's office is to apprehend it from observation of the phenomena themselves; as is intimated in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where even to the Greek "<span class="accented">the</span> invisible things of God from the creation of the world" are said to be "clearly seen, being understood [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: cf <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the passage before us] by the things that are made, <span class="accented">even</span> his eternal power and Godhead." The drift of both passages is the same, viz. this, and no more - that faith recognizes an unseen power and Godhead behind, and accounting for, the seen universe. Commentators, who - taking <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and hence seeking to explain what is meant by "non-apparent things" - perceive here a reference either to the formless void (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>) out of which the present creation was evolved, or to the Platonic conception of eternal ideas in the Divine mind, read into the text what is not there. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Neither does this verse belong to the list of historical instances from Genesis, in which men exercised faith. It is merely the first instance presented in O.T. history of an opportunity for the exercise of faith as the assurance and conviction of things not seen. Like <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11-2.htm">Hebrews 11:2</a>, it is closely connected with the definition. It contains the exposition of the nature of faith, by showing that in its earliest and most general expression - belief in the creation of the visible universe by God - it is a conviction of something not apprehensible by sense.<p>We understand (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; signifies to perceive with the &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; or reflective intelligence. In Class. of seeing with the eyes, sometimes with &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; expressed; but as early as Homer it is distinguished from the mere physical act of vision, as perception of the mind consequent upon seeing. Thus, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; and seeing him he perceived (Il. xi. 599): &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;' &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; I neither saw nor perceived (Od. xiii. 318). In N.T. never of the mere physical act. Here is meant the inward perception and apprehension of the visible creation as the work of God, which follows the sight of the phenomena of nature.<p>The worlds (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit. the ages.

The A.V. gives the impression of one giving his assent to an account of creation; but the perfect tense exhibits the faith of one who is actually contemplating creation itself.<p>By the word of God (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-5.htm">Psalm 118:5</a>.<p>So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>For things which are seen, rend. that which is seen.

We perceive that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that (this being the case) that which is visible has not arisen out of that which is seen. &#x39c;&#x3b7;&#768; not negatives the remainder of the clause taken as a whole. In other words, the proposition denied is, that which is seen arose out of visible things. By many early interpreters &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; was transposed, and construed with &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; alone, signifying "that which is seen has arisen from things which do not appear." These things were explained as chaos, the invisible creative powers of God, etc. </body></html>
