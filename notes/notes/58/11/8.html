If heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall obey and go forth, though not knowing what may befall us; and we shall be found in the way of duty, looking for the performance of God's promises. The trial of Abraham's faith was, that he simply and fully obeyed the call of God. Sarah received the promise as the promise of God; being convinced of that, she truly judged that he both could and would perform it. Many, who have a part in the promises, do not soon receive the things promised. Faith can lay hold of blessings at a great distance; can make them present; can love them and rejoice in them, though strangers; as saints, whose home is heaven; as pilgrims, travelling toward their home. By faith, they overcome the terrors of death, and bid a cheerful farewell to this world, and to all the comforts and crosses of it. And those once truly and savingly called out of a sinful state, have no mind to return into it. All true believers desire the heavenly inheritance; and the stronger faith is, the more fervent those desires will be. Notwithstanding their meanness by nature, their vileness by sin, and the poverty of their outward condition, God is not ashamed to be called the God of all true believers; such is his mercy, such is his love to them. Let them never be ashamed of being called his people, nor of any of those who are truly so, how much soever despised in the world. Above all, let them take care that they are not a shame and reproach to their God. The greatest trial and act of faith upon record is, Abraham's offering up Isaac, Ge 22:2. There, every word shows a trial. It is our duty to reason down our doubts and fears, by looking, as Abraham did, to the Almighty power of God. The best way to enjoy our comforts is, to give them up to God; he will then again give them as shall be the best for us. Let us look how far our faith has caused the like obedience, when we have been called to lesser acts of self-denial, or to make smaller sacrifices to our duty. Have we given up what was called for, fully believing that the Lord would make up all our losses, and even bless us by the most afflicting dispensations?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By faith Abraham - There is no difficulty in determining that Abraham was influenced by faith in God. The case is even stronger than that of Noah, for it is expressly declared, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, "And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness." Compare notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm">Romans 4:1-5</a>. In the illustrations of the power of faith in this chapter, the apostle appeals to two instances in which it was exhibited by Abraham, "the father of the faithful." Each of these required confidence in God of extraordinary strength, and each of them demanded a special and honorable mention. The first was that when he left his own country to go to a distant land of strangers (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8-10</a>); the other when he showed his readiness to sacrifice his own son in obedience to the will of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17-19</a>.<p>When he was called - <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, "Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee."<p>Into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed - To Palestine, or the land of Canaan, though that was not indicated at the time.<p>And he went out, not knowing whither he went - <a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>. Abraham at that time took with him Sarai, and Lot the son of his brother, and "the souls that they had gotten in Haran." Terah, the father of Abraham, started on the journey with them, but died in Haran; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31-32</a>. The original call was made to Abraham, <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2-3</a>, but he appears to have induced his father and his nephew to accompany him. At this time he had no children <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>, though it seems probable that Lot had; <a href="/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a>. Some, however, understand the expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a>, "and the souls they had gotten in Haran," as referring to the servants or domestics that they had in various ways procured, and to the fact that Abraham and Lot gradually drew around them a train of dependents and followers who were disposed to unite with them, and accompany them wherever they went. The Chaldee Paraphrast; understands it of the proselytes which Abraham had made there - "All the souls which he had subdued unto the law." When it is said that Abraham "went out, not knowing whither he went," it must be understood as meaning that he was ignorant to what country he would in fact be led. If it be supposed that he had some general intimation of the nature of that country, arid of the direction in which it was situated, yet it must be remembered that the knowledge of geography was then exceedingly imperfect; that this was a distant country; that it lay beyond a pathless desert, and that probably no traveler had ever come from that land to apprize him what it was. All this serves to show what was the strength of the faith of Abraham. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. From the antediluvian saints he passes to the patriarchs of Israel, to whom "the promises" belonged.<p>called&#8212;by God (Ge 12:1). The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate read, "He that was called Abraham," his name being changed from Abram to Abraham, on the occasion of God's making with him and his seed a covenant sealed by circumcision, many years after his call out of Ur. "By faith, he who was (afterwards) called Abraham (father of nations, Ge 17:5, in order to become which was the design of God's bringing him out of Ur) obeyed (the command of God: to be understood in this reading), so as to go out," &c.<p>which he should after receive&#8212;He had not fully received even this promise when he went out, for it was not explicitly given him till he had reached Canaan (Ge 12:1, 6, 7).

The Alexandrian copy and the Vulgate Latin version read, "by faith he who was called Abraham"; but this call is not to be understood of his name; for though his first name Abram might be given him, in the faith of his being a great man, and his second name Abraham, when he himself was a believer; yet this change was made some years after the call referred to; which is that in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a> when he was called out of his own country, kindred, and father's house; which was an emblem of the call of God's people out from among the men of the world, and from their friends, relations, and acquaintance, and even out of themselves; and as Abraham was called from "Ur" of the Chaldees, so they from darkness, bondage, idolatry, and communion with wicked men; that, as he, they might not perish with idolaters, being chosen vessels, and for whom God has peculiar blessings in store: and so the grace of God is seen in calling them, without any respect to their deserts, as in calling Abraham: and the care and goodness of God may be observed, in raising up fit instruments to propagate his cause and interest. Now Abraham, being called <p>to go out into a place; from Ur of the Chaldees, to the land of Canna; <p>which he should afterwards receive for an inheritance; not in his own person, but in his seed and posterity, unless after the resurrection, in the New Jerusalem church state, and which inheritance was typical of heaven; <p>obeyed the divine call; and which was a fruit and evidence of his faith, and may he called the obedience of faith: <p>and he went out, not knowing whither he went: for though he went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan he came, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5</a>, yet, when God called him to go forth, and he prepared to obey his call, he knew not what land he was to go into; for it is only said, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, <p>unto a land that I will show thee: upon which words a Jewish commentator (r) has this note; <p>"he (God) did not immediately make known the land unto him, that so it might be lovely in his eyes;'' <p>and it is, elsewhere, said by the Jews (s), that Abraham <p>"came from Aspamia (i.e. Mesopotamia), and its companions,    , "and he knew not where" he was, as a man that is in the dark;'' <p>all which agrees with our apostle: and, from hence, it may be observed, that God sometimes leads his people in ways they have not known, though they are known to him, and are always right; and that it is the property of faith to follow God, when it cannot see its way; and a great mercy it is to have God for a guide.

This is true even of ordinary life” (Davidson). This did not exhaust the faith of Abraham. Further <span class="greekheb">πίστει παρῴκησεν</span>.… “By faith he became a sojourner in a land [his] by the promise as if it belonged to another, dwelling in tents, along with Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs with him of the same promise.” <span class="greekheb">παρῴκησεν</span>, as in <a href="/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">πάροικον ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ</span>, dwelt alongside of the proper inhabitants. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm" title="And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.">Genesis 17:8</a> and <span class="ital">passim</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> in its common pregnant sense, <a href="/john/21-4.htm" title="But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.">John 21:4</a>; <a href="/acts/8-40.htm" title="But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.">Acts 8:40</a>; Pet. <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a> and especially <a href="/acts/7-4.htm" title="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.">Acts 7:4</a>. He lived in the promised land, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀλλοτρίαν</span>, as if it belonged to some other person; neither did he make a permanent settlement in it but dwelt in tents, shifting from place to place, the symbol of what is temporary, see <a href="/isaiah/38-12.htm" title="My age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night will you make an end of me.">Isaiah 38:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>. The presence of his son and grandson must continually have prompted him to settle. They were included in the promise, but they too were compelled to move with him from place to place. But how did this evince faith? It did so by showing that he had given a wider scope and a deeper significance to God’s words. He was content to dwell in tents, because he looked for “the city which has the foundations”. <span class="greekheb">ἐξεδέχετο γὰρ τὴν</span> … <span class="greekheb">πόλιν</span>. “For he expectantly waited for thecity.” <span class="greekheb">ἐκδέχομαι</span> (<a href="/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">Jam 5:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ γεωργὸς ἐκδεχ</span>., <a href="/acts/17-16.htm" title="Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.">Acts 17:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-33.htm" title="Why, my brothers, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another.">1 Corinthians 11:33</a>) occurs in Soph. <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, 123, where Jebb says: “The idea of the compound is ‘be ready for him,’ prepared to deal with him the moment he appears”. The city is described as one “that has the foundations” which the tents lacked, and which according to <a href="/hebrews/13-14.htm" title="For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.">Hebrews 13:14</a> is by implication not only <span class="greekheb">μέλλουσαν</span> but <span class="greekheb">μένουσαν</span>. In <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a> it is called “the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,” and in <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a> <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἄνω Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>. A city was the symbol of a settled condition, as in <a href="/psalms/107-7.htm" title="And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.">Psalm 107:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">πόλις κατοικητηρίου</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the interesting parallel in Philo. <span class="ital">Leg. Alleg.</span>, iii.–xxvi., p. 103, <span class="greekheb">πόλις δέ ἐστιν ἀγαθὴ καὶ τολλὴ καὶ σφόδρα εὐδαίμων</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ γὰρ δῶρα τοῦ θεοῦ μεγάλα καὶ τίμια</span>. It is further described as <span class="greekheb">ἧς τεχνίτης καὶ δημιουργὸς ὁ θεός</span>, “whose constructer and maker is God”. <span class="greekheb">τεχνίτης</span> is used of the silversmiths in <a href="/acts/19-24.htm" title="For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;">Acts 19:24</a>, of God as Maker of the world in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/13-1.htm" title="Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is: neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the workmaster;">Wis 13:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/14-2.htm" title="For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill.">Wis 14:2</a>, <span class="greekheb">τεχνίτνς δὲ σοφίᾳ κατεσκεύασεν</span>. Perhaps “artificer” comes nearest to the meaning. <span class="greekheb">δημιουργός</span>, originally one who works for the people, but applied by Plato (<span class="ital">Rep.</span>, p. 530) to God; and so, very often in Josephus and Philo (see Krebs. <span class="ital">in loc</span>.). For the use of the title among the Gnostics, see Mansel, <span class="ital">Gnostic Heresies</span>, p. 19. In Clement, <span class="ital">Ep.</span>, 20, we have <span class="greekheb">ὁ μέγας δημιουργὸς καὶ δεσπότης τῶν ἁπάντων</span>. In <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-1.htm" title="This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been a betrayer of the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if he had terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils.">2Ma 4:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">τῶν κακῶν δημιουργὸς</span>. “Maker” most adequately translates the word. Wetstein shows that <span class="greekheb">τεχνίτης καὶ δημιουργὸς</span> was not an uncommon combination and aptly compares Cicero (<span class="ital">De Nat. D.</span>, i. 8) “Opificem aedificatorem mundi”. The statement of this verse shows that Abraham and other enlightened O.T. saints (<span class="ital">cf.</span> chap. 4) understood that their connection with God, the Eternal One, was their great possession, of which earthly gifts and blessings were but present manifestations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">Abraham</span>] As was natural, the faith of “the father of the faithful was one of the commonest topics of discussion in the Jewish Schools.
