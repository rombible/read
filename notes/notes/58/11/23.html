Things present are not the best things; no man knoweth love or hatred by having them or wanting them. Jacob lived by faith, and he died by faith, and in faith. Though the grace of faith is of use always through our whole lives, it is especially so when we come to die. Faith has a great work to do at last, to help the believer to die to the Lord, so as to honour him, by patience, hope, and joy. Joseph was tried by temptations to sin, by persecution for keeping his integrity; and he was tried by honours and power in the court of Pharaoh, yet his faith carried him through. It is a great mercy to be free from wicked laws and edicts; but when we are not so, we must use all lawful means for our security. In this faith of Moses' parents there was a mixture of unbelief, but God was pleased to overlook it. Faith gives strength against the sinful, slavish fear of men; it sets God before the soul, shows the vanity of the creature, and that all must give way to the will and power of God. The pleasures of sin are, and will be, but short; they must end either in speedy repentance or in speedy ruin. The pleasures of this world are for the most part the pleasures of sin; they are always so when we cannot enjoy them without deserting God and his people. Suffering is to be chosen rather than sin; there being more evil in the least sin, than there can be in the greatest suffering. God's people are, and always have been, a reproached people. Christ accounts himself reproached in their reproaches; and thus they become greater riches than the treasures of the richest empire in the world. Moses made his choice when ripe for judgment and enjoyment, able to know what he did, and why he did it. It is needful for persons to be seriously religious; to despise the world, when most capable of relishing and enjoying it. Believers may and ought to have respect to the recompence of reward. By faith we may be fully sure of God's providence, and of his gracious and powerful presence with us. Such a sight of God will enable believers to keep on to the end, whatever they may meet in the way. It is not owing to our own righteousness, or best performances, that we are saved from the wrath of God; but to the blood of Christ, and his imputed righteousness. True faith makes sin bitter to the soul, even while it receives the pardon and atonement. All our spiritual privileges on earth, should quicken us in our way to heaven. The Lord will make even Babylon fall before the faith of his people, and when he has some great thing to do for them, he raises up great and strong faith in them. A true believer is desirous, not only to be in covenant with God, but in communion with the people of God; and is willing to fare as they fare. By her works Rahab declared herself to be just. That she was not justified by her works appears plainly; because the work she did was faulty in the manner, and not perfectly good, therefore it could not be answerable to the perfect justice or righteousness of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By faith Moses, when he was born - That is, by the faith of his parents. The faith of Moses himself is commended in the following verses. The statement of the apostle here is, that his parents were led to preserve his life by their confidence in God. They believed that he was destined to some great purpose, and that he would be spared, notwithstanding all the probabilities against it, and all the difficulties in the case.<p>Was hid three months of his parents - By his parents. In <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-2.htm">Exodus 2:2</a>, it is said that it was done "by his mother." The truth doubtless was, that the mother was the agent in doing it - since the concealment, probably, could be better effected by one than where two were employed - but that the father also concurred in it is morally certain. The concealment was, at first, probably in their own house. The command seems to have been <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>, that the child should be cast into the river as soon as born. This child was concealed in the hope that some way might be found out by which his life might be spared.<p>Because they saw he was a proper child - A fair, or beautiful child -  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  asteion. The word properly means "pertaining to a city" - (from &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;  astu, a city); then urbane, polished, elegant; then fair, beautiful. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>, it is said that he was "fair to God," (Margin,); that is, exceedingly fair, or very handsome. His extraordinary beauty seems to have been the reason which particularly influenced his parents to attempt to preserve him. It is not impossible that they supposed that his uncommon beauty indicated that he was destined to some important service in life, and that they were on that account the more anxious to save him.<p>And they were not afraid of the king's commandment - Requiring that all male children should be given up to be thrown into the Nile. That is, they were not so alarmed, or did not so dread the king, as to be induced to comply with the command. The strength of the faith of the parents of Moses, appears:<p>(1) because the command of Pharaoh to destroy all the male children was positive, but they had so much confidence in God as to disregard it.<p>(2) because there was a strong improbability that their child could be saved. They themselves found it impossible to conceal him longer than three months, and when it was discovered, there was every probability that the law would be enforced and that the child would be put to death. Perhaps there was reason also to apprehend that the parents would be punished for disregarding the authority of the king.<p>(3) because they probably believed that their child was destined to some important work. They thus committed him to God instead of complying with the command of an earthly monarch, and against strong probabilities in the ease, they believed that it was possible that in some way he might be preserved alive. The remarkable result showed that their faith was not unfounded. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. parents&#8212;So the Septuagint has the plural, namely, Amram and Jochebed (Nu 26:59); but in Ex 2:2, the mother alone is mentioned; but doubtless Amram sanctioned all she did, and secrecy. being their object, he did not appear prominent in what was done.<p>a proper child&#8212;Greek, "a comely child."

Which is to be understood, not of the faith of Moses, but of the faith of his parents, at the time of his birth; which was when Pharaoh had published an edict, ordering every male child to be cast into the river; but instead of obeying this order, Moses was hid three months of his parents; that is, in his father's house, as it is said in <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a> and is here expressed in the Ethiopic version. According to the Targumist (k), his mother went with him but six months, at the end of which he was born, and that she hid him three months, which made up the nine, the time in which a woman usually goes with child; and after that she could conceal him no longer: the hiding of him is here ascribed to both his parents, though in <a href="/exodus/2-2.htm">Exodus 2:2</a> it is represented as the act of his mother; which, no doubt, was done, with the knowledge, advice, and consent of his father; and the Septuagint there renders it,  "they hid him"; though the order of the history makes it necessary that it should be read in the singular. Parents ought to take care of their children; and persons may lawfully hide themselves, or others, from the cruelty of tyrants, and that as long as they can, for their safety; and this was so far from being wrong in the parents of Moses, that it is commended, as an instance of faith: they believed the promise in general, that God would deliver the people of Israel; they believed this to be about the time of their deliverance, and had some intimation, that this child in particular would be the deliverer, because they saw he was a proper child; not only of a goodly and beautiful countenance, but that he was peculiarly grateful and acceptable to God; they perceived something remarkable in him, which to them was a token that he would be the deliverer of God's people, and therefore they hid him; See Gill on <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>. <p>And they were not afraid of the king's commandment; nor did they observe it, for it was contrary to nature, and to the laws of God, and to the promise of God's multiplying of that people, and to their hopes of deliverance: there is a great deal of courage and boldness in faith; and though faith may be weakened, it cannot be lost; and a weak faith is taken notice of, as here; for though they feared not at first, they seem to be afraid afterwards; but when God designs to work deliverance, nothing shall prevent. <p>(k) Jonathan ben Uzziel in Exod. ii. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a proper child; and they were not <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> afraid of the king's commandment.</span><p>(11) Moses.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/11-23.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.">Hebrews 11:23</a> he points to the faith manifested by the relatives of Moses at the time of his birth.

Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.">Jonah 3:3</a>) or as Philo, <span class="ital">De Mos.</span>, p. 82, <span class="greekheb">ὄψιν ἀστειοτέραν ἢ κατʼ ἰδιώτην</span>, indicating that he had a corresponding destiny. Moses himself when he had grown up (<span class="greekheb">μέγας γενόμενος</span>, as in <a href="/exodus/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.">Exodus 2:11</a> paraphrased by Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-23.htm" title="And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel.">Acts 7:23</a>) <span class="greekheb">ὡς δὲ ἐπληροῦτο αὐτῷ τεσσαρακονταετὴς χρόνος</span>.) refused to be called a son of a daughter of Pharaoh. The significance and source of this refusal lay in his preferring to suffer ill-usage with God’s people rather than to have a short-lived enjoyment of sin. <span class="greekheb">συνκακ</span>., the simple verb in <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>, also <a href="/hebrews/13-3.htm" title="Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.">Hebrews 13:3</a>; the compound here only. <span class="greekheb">τῷ λαῷ τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, it was because they were God’s people, not solely because they were of his blood, that Moses threw in his lot with them. It was this which illustrated his faith. He believed that God would fulfil His promise to His people, little likelihood as at present there seemed to be of any great future for his race. On the other hand there was the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας ἀπόλαυσις</span>, the enjoyment which was within his reach if only he committed the sin of denying his people and renouncing their future as promised by God. For “the enjoyment to be reaped from sin” does not refer to the pleasure of gratifying sensual appetite and so forth, but to the satisfaction of a high ambition and the gratification of his finer tastes which he might have had by remaining in the Egyptian court. Very similarly Philo interprets the action of Moses, who, he says, “esteemed the good things of those who had adopted him, although more splendid for a season, to be in reality spurious, but those of his natural parents, although for a little while less conspicuous, to be true and genuine” (<span class="ital">De Mose</span>, p. 86). That which influenced Moses to make this choice was his estimate of the comparative value of the outcome of suffering with God’s people and of the happiness offered in Egypt. <span class="greekheb">μείζονα πλοῦτον</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν μισθαποδοσίαν</span>, “since he considered the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he steadily kept in view the reward”. The reproach or obloquy and disgrace, which Moses experienced is called “the reproach of the Christ” because it was on account of his belief in God’s saving purpose that he suffered. The expression is interpreted by our Lord’s statement that Abraham saw his day. It does not imply that Moses believed that a personal Christ was to come, but only that God would fulfil that promise which in point of fact was fulfilled in the coming of Christ. The writer uses the expression rather with a view to his readers who were shrinking from the reproach of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm" title="Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.">Hebrews 13:13</a>), than from the point of view of Moses. Several interpreters (Delitzsch, etc.) suppose that in virtue of the mystical union Christ suffered in his people. But, as Davidson says, “this mystical union cannot be shown to be an idea belonging to the Epistle, nor is this sense pertinent to the connection.” (So Weiss, “die vorstellung liegt unserem Briefe fern”.) Weiss’ own interpretation is ingenious: “The O.T. church was created by the pre-existent Messiah to be the people who were destined to introduce through Him perfect salvation; therefore each maltreatment of this people was contempt of Him as unable to avenge and deliver His people”. To say that it means merely “the same reproach that Christ bore” scarcely satisfies the expression. The “treasures of Egypt” must be supposed to include all that had been accumulated during centuries of civilisation. <span class="greekheb">ἀπέβλεπεν</span>, he habitually kept in view the reward. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Xen., <span class="ital">Hist.</span>, vi. 1, 8 <span class="greekheb">ἡ σὴ πατρὶς εἰς σὲ ἀποβλέπει</span>, also <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm" title="The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.">Psalm 11:4</a>, Philo, <span class="ital">De Opif.</span>, p. 4. <span class="greekheb">κατέλιπεν Αἴγυπτον</span>, “he forsook Egypt,” and fled to Midian. That this flight and not the Exodus is meant appears from the connection of the clause both with what precedes and with what follows. It exhibits the result of his choice (<a href="/hebrews/11-26.htm" title="Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.">Hebrews 11:26</a>), and it alludes to what preceded the Passover (<a href="/hebrews/11-28.htm" title="Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.">Hebrews 11:28</a>). The word <span class="greekheb">ἐκαρτέρησεν</span>, denoting long continued endurance also suits better this reference. The only difficulty in the way of accepting this interpretation is found in the words <span class="greekheb">μὴ φοβηθεὶς τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ βασιλέως</span>, because, according to <a href="/exodus/2-15.htm" title="Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.">Exodus 2:15</a>, the motive of his flight was fear of the king. <span class="greekheb">ἐφοβήθη δὲ Μωυσῆς</span>. But what is in the writer’s mind is not Pharaoh’s wrath as cause but as consequence of Moses’ abandonment of Egypt. His flight showed that he had finally renounced life at court, and in thus indicating by this decisive action that he was an Israelite, and meant to share with his people, he braved the king’s wrath. This he was strengthened to do because he saw an invisible monarch greater than Pharaoh. Vaughan seems the only interpreter who has precisely hit the writer’s meaning: “the two fears are different, the one is the fear arising from the discovery of his slaying the Egyptian, the other is the fear of Pharaoh’s anger on discovering his flight. <span class="ital">He feared and therefore fled: he feared not, and therefore fled</span>.” Having fled and so cutting himself off from all immediate opportunity of helping his people, <span class="greekheb">ἐκαρτέρησεν</span>, “he steadfastly bided his time,” because he saw the Invisible, being thus an eminent illustration of faith as <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγχος οὐ βλεπομένων</span>. The aorist gathers the forty years in Midian into one exhibition of wonderful perseverance in faith. It was the upper form of the school which disciplined Moses and wrought him to the mould of a hero. Another point in his career at which faith manifested itself was the Exodus, <span class="greekheb">πεποίηκεν τὸ πάσχα</span>, “he hath celebrated the Passover”. Alford says the perfect is used on account of the Passover being “a still enduring Feast”. But it is Moses’ celebration of it that the perfect represents as enduring. The classical treatment of the question, Has <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span> a sacrificial meaning in the N.T.? will be found in Prof. T. K. Abbott’s <span class="ital">Essays</span>. <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span> is regularly used of “keeping” a feast; and this is a classical usage as well. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/exodus/12-48.htm" title="And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-22.htm" title="And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="/context/2_chronicles/35-17.htm" title="And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days....">2 Chronicles 35:17-19</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ πάσχα</span> originally the paschal lamb, <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ θύσατε τὸ πάσχα</span>, <a href="/mark/14-12.htm" title="And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, Where will you that we go and prepare that you may eat the passover?">Mark 14:12</a> <span class="greekheb">τὸ πάσχα ἔθυον</span>, hence the feast of Passover as in <a href="/luke/22-1.htm" title="Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover.">Luke 22:1</a>. It is written <span class="greekheb">φασέκ</span> throughout 2 Chronicles 30, 35, also in <a href="/jeremiah/38-8.htm" title="Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king saying,">Jeremiah 38:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν πρόσχυσιν τοῦ αἵματος</span>, “and the affusion of the blood” the sprinkling of the blood on the door posts as commanded in <a href="/exodus/12-7.htm" title="And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.">Exodus 12:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-22.htm" title="And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.">Exodus 12:22</a>, the object being that the destroyers of the first-borns might not touch them. As <span class="greekheb">θιγγάνω</span> is followed by a genitive in <a href="/hebrews/12-20.htm" title="(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:">Hebrews 12:20</a> it is probable that the writer here also meant it to govern <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> while <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκα</span> follows <span class="greekheb">ὀλοθρεύων</span>. So R.V. <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὀλοθρεύων</span> is taken from <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκα</span>, first-borns of man and also of beasts, <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm" title="For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.">Exodus 12:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> is naturally referred to “the people of God,” <a href="/hebrews/11-25.htm" title="Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;">Hebrews 11:25</a>. It was a noteworthy faith which enabled Moses confidently to promise the people protection from the general destruction. On their part also there was the manifestation of a strong faith. <span class="greekheb">διέβησαν τὴν ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν</span> … “they passed through the Red sea as if on dry land”. The nominative must be taken out of <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>. <span class="greekheb">διέβησαν</span>, the usual term for crossing a river or a space. The Red sea is in Hebrew “the Sea of [red] weeds”. <span class="greekheb">διὰ ξηρᾶς γῆς</span> as in <a href="/exodus/14-29.htm" title="But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.">Exodus 14:29</a> <span class="greekheb">ἐπορεύθησαν διὰ ξηρᾶς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης</span>, also <a href="/exodus/15-19.htm" title="For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the middle of the sea.">Exodus 15:19</a>; and <span class="ital">cf.</span> the various impressions in the Psalms which celebrate the great deliverance. The greatness of the people’s faith is accentuated by the fate of the Egyptians, whose attempt to follow was audacity and presumption not faith. <span class="greekheb">ἧς πεῖραν λαβόντες</span> … “of which [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, of the sea] making trial the Egyptians were swallowed up,” <a href="/exodus/15-4.htm" title="Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.">Exodus 15:4</a> <span class="greekheb">κατεπόθησαν ἐν ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ</span>. Another instance of the faith of the people and its effects is found in the fall of the walls of Jericho. The greatness of the faith may be measured by the difficulty we now have in believing that the walls fell without the application of any visible force. God’s promise was, <span class="greekheb">πεσεῖται αὐτόματα τὰ τείχη</span>, and believing this promise the people compassed the city seven days. The greatness of their faith was further exhibited in their continuing to compass the city day after day, for in the promise (<a href="/context/joshua/6-1.htm" title="Now Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in....">Joshua 6:1-5</a>) no mention is made of any delay in its fulfilment and the natural inference would be that the walls would fall on the first day. That none should have felt foolish marching day after day round the solid walls is beyond nature, <span class="greekheb">κυκλωθέντα</span>, see <a href="/joshua/6-6.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.">Joshua 6:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-14.htm" title="And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.">Joshua 6:14</a> and for <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας</span>, <a href="/joshua/6-14.htm" title="And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.">Joshua 6:14</a>. “When applied to time, <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> denotes the period over which something extends, as <a href="/luke/4-25.htm" title="But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;">Luke 4:25</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ ἔτη τρία</span>, during three years” (Winer, p. 508). The fall of Jericho and the extermination of its inhabitants suggest the escape of Rahab. <span class="greekheb">ἡ πόρνη</span>, in its strict meaning (“ista meretrix” (Origen), “fornicaria” (Irenaeus), is introduced to emphasise the power of faith; she did not perish along with the disobedient (<a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm" title="And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?">Hebrews 3:18</a>); <span class="greekheb">ἀπειθήσασιν</span>, they knew that the Lord had given the land to Israel (<a href="/context/joshua/2-9.htm" title="And she said to the men, I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you....">Joshua 2:9-10</a>) but did not submit themselves to the acknowledged purpose of Jehovah. Rahab acted upon her belief in this purpose and instead of delivering up the spies as enemies of her country “received them with peace,” that is, as friends, risking her life because of her faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">Moses … was hid</span>] The “faith” is of course that of his parents, Amram and Jochebed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of his parents</span>] This is implied in the LXX. of <a href="/exodus/2-2.htm" title="And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.">Exodus 2:2</a>, but the Hebrew only says that his <span class="ital">mother</span> concealed him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a proper child</span>] In <a href="/acts/7-20.htm" title="In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:">Acts 7:20</a> he is called “fair to God.” In his marvellous beauty (see Philo, <span class="ital">Vit.
