It is good to have the law of holy love and kindness written in the hearts of Christians, one towards another. Religion teaches men true civility and good breeding.

So it is rendered by Prof. Stuart and others. On the meaning of this, and its importance in determining who was the author of the Epistle, see the Introduction section 3, (5) 4, and Prof. Stuart's Introduction, section 19. This is a strong circumstance showing that Paul was the author of the Epistle, for from the first acquaintance of Timothy with Paul he is represented as his constant companion, and spoken of as a brother; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a> note; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a> note; <a href="/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a> note; <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/1.htm">Philippians 1</a> note. There is no other one of the apostles who would so naturally have used this term respecting Timothy, and this kind mention is made of him here because he was so dear to the heart of the writer, and because he felt that they to whom he wrote would also feel an interest in his circumstances. As to the meaning of the word rendered "set at liberty" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  apolelumenon - there has been much difference of opinion whether it means "set at liberty from confinement," or, "sent away on some message to some other place." That the latter is the meaning of the expression appears probable from these considerations.<p>(1) the connection seems to demand it. The writer speaks of him as if he were now away, and as if he hoped that he might soon return. "With whom, if he come shortly, I will see you." This is language which would be used rather of one who had been sent on some embassy than of one who was just released from prison. At all events, he was at this time away, and there was some expectation that he might soon return. But on the supposition that the expression relates to release from imprisonment, there would be an entire incongruity in the language. It is not, as we should then suppose, "our brother Timothy is now released from prison, and therefore I will come soon with him and see you;" but, "our brother Timothy is now sent away, and if he return soon I will come with him to you."<p>(2) in <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-23.htm">Philippians 2:23</a>, Paul, then a prisoner at Rome, speaks of the hope which he entertained that he would be able to send Timothy to them as soon as he should know how it would go with him. He designed to retain him until that point was settled, as his presence with him would be important until then, and then to send him to give consolation to the Philippians, and to look into the condition of the church. Now the passage before us agrees well with the supposition that that event had occurred - that Paul had ascertained with sufficient clearness that he would be released, so that he might be permitted yet to visit the Hebrew Christians, that he had sent Timothy to Philippi and was waiting for his return; that as soon as he should return he would be prepared to visit them; and that in the mean time while Timothy was absent, he wrote to them this Epistle.<p>(3) the supposition agrees well with the meaning of the word used here - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  apoluo&#772;. It denotes properly, to let loose from: to loosen; to unbind; to release; to let go free; to put away or divorce; to dismiss simply, or let go, or send away; see <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32</a>, <a href="/matthew/15-39.htm">Matthew 15:39</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12</a>, et al.; compare Robinson's Lexicon and Stuart's Introduction, section 19. The meaning, then, I take to be this, that Timothy was then sent away on some important embassage; that the apostle expected his speedy return; and that then he trusted that he would be able with him to visit those to whom this Epistle was written. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. our brother Timothy&#8212;So Paul, 1Co 4:17; 2Co 1:1; Col 1:1; 1Th 3:2.<p>is set at liberty&#8212;from prison. So Aristarchus was imprisoned with Paul. Birks translates, "dismissed," "sent away," namely, on a mission to Greece, as Paul promised (Php 2:19). However, some kind of previous detention is implied before his being let go to Philippi. Paul, though now at large, was still in Italy, whence he sends the salutations of Italian Christians (Heb 13:24), waiting for Timothy to join him, so as to start for Jerusalem: we know from 1Ti 1:3, he and Timothy were together at Ephesus after his departing from Italy eastward. He probably left Timothy there and went to Philippi as he had promised.

Of an imprisonment of Timothy nothing is known to us, it is true, from other sources, but the possibility of the same cannot be disputed. The suppositions, that <span class="greekheb">ἀπολελυμένον</span> signifies: <span class="ital">sent away to the Hebrews with our epistle</span> (Theodoret, subscription of the epistle in many cursives: <span class="greekheb">ἐγράφη ἀπὸ Ἰταλίας διὰ Τιμοθέου</span>; Faber Stapulensis, <span class="ital">al</span>.), or: <span class="ital">sent away somewhither, and consequently absent from the author</span> (Estius, Jac.

Evidently Timothy had been under arrest; where, when, or why is not known. The information is given because it would interest these Hebrew Christians, who were therefore friends of his, not Judaizers. <span class="greekheb">μεθʼ οὗ</span> … “with whom, if he come soon, I will see you”. He takes for granted that Timothy would at once go to them; and he speaks as one who is himself free or is immediately to be free to determine his own movements.

Epistolary form required this (see the Egyptian papyri) but in view of what the writer has said regarding the rulers, and in view of the <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span> here expressed, it may be supposed that the formula was here filled with significant contents. Who was to convey the salutations? Or, in other words, who was directly to receive the letter? Probably one or two of the leading men representing the Church. This would account for the <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span>. The greetings were not on the writer’s part only. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰταλίας</span>, “they of Italy” joined in them. The form of expression is that which is ordinarily used to denote natives of a place, as in <a href="/luke/23-50.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:">Luke 23:50</a>; <a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>; <a href="/john/11-1.htm" title="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.">John 11:1</a>; <a href="/acts/17-13.htm" title="But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.">Acts 17:13</a>, etc. Winer says (p. 785): “a critical argument as to the place at which the Epistle was written should never have been founded on these words”. Vaughan is certainly wrong in saying that the more natural suggestion of the words would be that the writer is himself in Italy and speaks of the Italian Christians surrounding him. The more natural suggestion, on the contrary, is that the writer is absent from Italy and is writing to it and that therefore the native Italians who happen to be with him join him in the salutations he sends to their compatriots.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Epistle closes with one of the usual formulae, “Grace be with you all”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">Know ye</span>] Or perhaps “<span class="ital">Ye know</span>,” or “know.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is set at liberty</span>] The word probably means (as in <a href="/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="/acts/4-21.htm" title="So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.">Acts 4:21</a>) “has been set free from prison.” It is intrinsically likely that Timothy at once obeyed the earnest and repeated entreaty of St Paul, shortly before his martyrdom, to come to him at Rome (<a href="/2_timothy/4-9.htm" title="Do your diligence to come shortly to me:">2 Timothy 4:9</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-21.htm" title="Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.">2 Timothy 4:21</a>), and that, arriving before the Neronian persecution had spent its force, he had been thrown into prison. His comparative youth, and the unoffending gentleness of his character, together with the absence of any definite charge against him, may have led to his liberation. All this however is nothing more than reasonable conjecture. The word <span class="ital">apolelumenos</span> may mean no more than official, or even ordinary, “sending forth” on some mission or otherwise, as in <a href="/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="/acts/15-30.htm" title="So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter:">Acts 15:30</a>; <a href="/acts/19-41.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.">Acts 19:41</a>; <a href="/acts/23-22.htm" title="So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See you tell no man that you have showed these things to me.">Acts 23:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if he come shortly, I will see you</span>] Lit. “if he come sooner,” i.e. earlier than I now expect (comp. <span class="greekheb">κάλλιον</span>, <a href="/acts/25-10.htm" title="Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as you very well know.">Acts 25:10</a>; <span class="greekheb">βέλτιον</span>, <a href="/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2 Timothy 1:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/13-23.htm" title="Know you that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.">Hebrews 13:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γινώσκετε</span>) <span class="ital">know ye</span>, with joy.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀδελφὸν</span>, <span class="ital">our brother</span>) So Timothy is called by <span class="ital">Paul:</span> see note on <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπολελυμένον</span>, <span class="ital">set at liberty</span>) He had therefore been in prison.—<span class="greekheb">ἔρχηται</span>, <span class="ital">if he come</span>) to me.

Further, though not proving St. Paul's authorship, it supports the conclusion that the writer, if not himself, was one of his associates, Timothy having been peculiarly his disciple and companion. It seems that Timothy had been, as the readers were aware, in prison; and the joyful news is communicated of his release, and of the prospect of his visiting them. This again shows that the Epistle was addressed to a definite circle of readers. It is observable that the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which does not occur in St. Paul's writings, is, like so many expressions throughout the Epistle, one usual with St. Luke (<a href="/luke/22-68.htm">Luke 22:68</a>; <a href="/luke/23-16.htm">Luke 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="/acts/4-21.htm">Acts 4:21</a>; where it expresses release from prison or captivity). He uses it also for dismissal of persons on a mission (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30</a>); and hence one view is that Timothy's having already set out to visit the Church addressed is all that is here meant. But the other meaning of the word is more likely. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Our brother Timothy (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Paul's habit, when using &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; brother with a proper name, is to put the proper name first.
