The apostle then states what is their duty to living ministers; to obey and submit to them, so far as is agreeable to the mind and will of God, made known in his word. Christians must not think themselves too wise, too good, or too great, to learn. The people must search the Scriptures, and so far as the ministers teach according to that rule, they ought to receive their instructions as the word of God, which works in those that believe. It is the interest of hearers, that the account their ministers give of them may be with joy, and not with grief. Faithful ministers deliver their own souls, but the ruin of a fruitless and faithless people will be upon their own heads. The more earnestly the people pray for their ministers, the more benefit they may expect from their ministry. A good conscience has respect to all God's commands, and all our duty. Those who have this good conscience, yet need the prayers of others. When ministers come to a people who pray for them, they come with greater satisfaction to themselves, and success to the people. We should seek all our mercies by prayer. God is the God of peace, fully reconciled to believers; who has made a way for peace and reconciliation between himself and sinners, and who loves peace on earth, especially in his churches. He is the Author of spiritual peace in the hearts and consciences of his people. How firm a covenant is that which has its foundation in the blood of the Son of God! The perfecting of the saints in every good work, is the great thing desired by them, and for them; and that they may at length be fitted for the employment and happiness of heaven. There is no good thing wrought in us, but it is the work of God. And no good thing is wrought in us by God, but through Christ, for his sake and by his Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pray for us - This is a request which the apostle often makes in his own behalf, and in behalf of his fellow laborers in the gospel; see <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:25</a>. notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18-19</a>.<p>For we trust we have a good conscience ... - see the notes on <a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>. The apostle here appeals to the uprightness of his Christian life as a reason why he might claim their sympathy. He was conscious of an aim to do good; he sought the welfare of the church; and having this aim he felt that he might appeal to the sympathy of all Christians in his behalf. It is only when we aim to do right, and to maintain a good conscience, that we can with propriety ask the prayers of others, or claim their sympathy. And if we are "willing in all things to live honestly," we may expect the sympathy, the prayers, and the affections of all good people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

In refutation of the Jews' aspersions, he asserts in the same language as here his own conscientiousness before God and man, Ac 23:1-3; 24:16, 20, 21 (wherein he virtually implies that his reply to Ananias was not sinful impatience; for, indeed, it was a prophecy which he was inspired at the moment to utter, and which was fulfilled soon after).<p>we trust&#8212;Greek, "we are persuaded," in the oldest manuscripts.

The Lord be with you all.">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>; <a href="/romans/15-33.htm" title="Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.">Romans 15:33</a>; <a href="/romans/16-20.htm" title="And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.">Romans 16:20</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-9.htm" title="Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.">Php 4:9</a>) because this attribute of God carries in it the guarantee that a termination shall be put to all misunderstanding, disturbance, and inability to do His will. His love of peace is shown in nothing more than in His concluding an eternal covenant with men. This covenant was sealed when “our Lord Jesus,” having laid down his life for the sheep, was brought up from the dead in virtue of the perfect and accepted sacrifice (<span class="greekheb">ἐν αἵματι διαθήκης</span>). Elsewhere in the Epistle the blood is spoken of as giving entrance to the presence of God, here as delivering from that which prevented that entrance. As Vaughan says: “The <span class="ital">arrival</span> in the heavenly presence for us in virtue of the atoning blood is here viewed in its <span class="ital">start</span> from the grave … It was in virtue of the availing sacrifice that Christ either left the tomb or reentered heaven.” <span class="greekheb">ἐν αἵματι διαθήκης</span> is therefore more naturally connected with <span class="greekheb">ἀναγαγών</span> than with <span class="greekheb">τὸν ποιμένα</span>, although the two connections are closely related. It was as the Great Shepherd that Jesus gave His life for the sheep and by this act established for ever His claim to be the Shepherd of His people. It is this claim also that guarantees that He will lose none but will raise them up at the last day (<span class="ital">cf.</span> John 15). [It is probable that the phrasing of this verse was influenced by <a href="/zechariah/9-7.htm" title="And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remains, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.">Zechariah 9:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">σὺ ἐν αἵματι διαθήκης σου ἐξαπέστειλας δεσμίους σου ἐκ λάκκου οὐκ ἔχοντος ὕδωρ</span>, and by <a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm" title="Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?">Isaiah 63:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">ποῦ ὁ ἀναβιβάσας ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης τὸν ποιμένα τῶν προβάτων</span>.] The prayer follows, <span class="greekheb">καταρτίσαι ὑμᾶς</span>, “perfectly equip you” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>) <span class="greekheb">ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ</span>, “in every good work,” that is, enabling you to do every good work and so equipping you <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ</span>, “for the doing of His will,” “doing in you that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Php 2:13</a>). The words <span class="greekheb">διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> are apparently attached not exclusively to <span class="greekheb">f1τὸ εὐάρεστον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., but to the whole clause and especially to <span class="greekheb">καταρτίσαι</span>; it is through Jesus, now reigning as Christ, that all grace is bestowed on His people. The doxology may be to the God of peace to whom the prayer is addressed, more probably it is to Jesus Christ, last-named and the great figure who has been before the mind throughout the Epistle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Pray for us</span>] A frequent and natural request in Christian correspondence (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm" title="Brothers, pray for us.">1 Thessalonians 5:25</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;">Romans 15:30</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>).

These resemblances to St Paul’s method of concluding his letters are only of a general character, and we have reason to suppose that to a certain extent the beginnings and endings of Christian letters had assumed a recognised form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">willing</span>] i.e. “desiring,” “determining.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">honestly</span>] Honourably.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/13-18.htm" title="Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.">Hebrews 13:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προσεύχεσθε περὶ ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">pray for us</span>) So <span class="ital">Paul</span> is wont, and especially at the conclusion, to ask those to whom he writes: <a href="/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;">Romans 15:30</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πεποίθαμεν</span>) <span class="ital">we trust</span>, that we ourselves shall be heard and delivered.—<span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) the force of the Ætiology properly falls on <a href="/hebrews/13-19.htm" title="But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.">Hebrews 13:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) that is, <span class="ital">because;</span> for, <span class="ital">we trust</span>, is used absolutely, as <span class="ital">we are confident</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>. Conscience produces confidence: <a href="/1_john/3-21.htm" title="Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.">1 John 3:21</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καλὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καλῶς</span>, <span class="ital">good, in a good way</span> [<span class="ital">well</span>]) Conjugates.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶσι</span>, <span class="ital">in all things</span>) Neuter: see note on <a href="/2_corinthians/11-6.htm" title="But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>.—<span class="greekheb">θέλοντες</span>, <span class="ital">willing</span>) The conscience follows the will.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pray for us: for we trust</span> (rather, <span class="accented">we are persuaded</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that we have a good conscience, in all things willing</span> (i.e. desiring) <span class="cmt_word">to live honestly.</span> When St. Paul uses the plural <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> he usually at least, if not always, includes his colleagues (cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:25</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>). So probably the writer here, especially as there is a transition to the singular in the following verse. Whoever he was, he associates himself in sending the Epistle with his fellow-laborers, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with others of what we may call the Pauline circle, who were engaged with him elsewhere. Both this and the request for prayer, and also the assertion of integrity, which seems to imply suspicion of possible mistrust, are quite in St. Paul's way, and confirm the view that, though the author may not have been St. Paul himself, it was at any rate some one who was, or had been, closely connected with him. </body></html>
