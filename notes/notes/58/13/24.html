It is good to have the law of holy love and kindness written in the hearts of Christians, one towards another. Religion teaches men true civility and good breeding.

The pastors and officers of the church of the Hebrews, the same with those in <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a> and all the saints; the several members of the church, who were set apart to holiness by God; whose sins were expiated by Christ; to whom Christ was made sanctification; and who were internally sanctified by the Spirit of God, and lived holy lives and conversations; to these the apostle wished all prosperity, inward and outward, spiritual and temporal; and he uses the word "all" in both clauses; and, including every officer and member, expresses his universal love to them, whether high or low, rich or poor, greater or lesser believers: <p>they of Italy salute you; that is, the brethren, as the Vulgate Latin version reads; the Italian brethren; such as were at Puteoli, and other places, in that country; see <a href="/acts/28-13.htm">Acts 28:13</a>. Italy is a famous and well known country in Europe; a very fruitful and delightful one; of which Rome, where the apostle very likely now was, is the chief city: it has been called by different names, as Saturnia from Saturn; and Ausonia, Aenotria, and Hesperia Magna; and it had its name Italy, some say, from Italus, the son of Penelope and Telegonus; others, from Italus, a king of the Arcadians, or, as some say, the Sicilians; but, according to Timsaeus and Varro (e), it was so called from the multitude of oxen in it, which in the old Greek language were called  "Italoi", to which comes near in sound the Latin word "vituli", used for "calves"; and Italy is frequently, by Jewish writers (f) called  , "Italy of Greece"; and formerly it was inhabited by Greeks, and was called Great Greece (g): it is bounded on the east with the Adriatic sea; and on the west by the river Var, with the Alps, which separate France from Italy; and on the south with the Tyrrhene, or Tuscan sea, called the lower, and on the north, partly with the Alps, which are on the borders of Germany, and partly with the Adriatic sea, called the higher. There were Christians in this country before the Apostle Paul came to Rome, both at Rome, and other places, as before observed. It is said (h), that Barnabas was first at Rome, and planted the church there; that he went round Lombardy, and lived at Milain; that in the "first" century, Apollinaris preached at Ravenna, and Hermagoras at Aquileia; and there were Christian churches in the "second" century, not only at Rome, but in many other cities and places; and so likewise in the "third" century, as at Verona, Spoletum, Beneventum, &amp;c. and in the "fourth" century, there were great numbers of churches in this country; as at Verona, and Capua, in Calabria, Campania, and Apulia; and which might be traced in following centuries. <p>(e) Apud Aul.

Probably, however, the meaning of the author is only that those to whom the epistle is delivered, for reading to the congregation, should greet as well all the presidents as also all the other members of the congregation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰταλίας</span>] is not to be explained from the absorption of one local preposition into another; in such wise that it should stand for <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἰταλίᾳ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰταλίας</span>, which is thought possible by Winer, <span class="ital">Gramm.</span>, 7 Aufl. p. 584. It signifies: <span class="ital">those from Italy, i.e.</span> Christians who have come out of Italy, and are now to be found in the surroundings of the writer. The general expression: <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰταλίας</span>, seems to point to a compact number of persons already known to the readers. It is highly probable, therefore, that those referred to are Christians who, on the occasion of the Neronian persecution, had fled from Italy, and had settled down for the time being at the place of the author’s present abode. The expression shows, moreover, that the epistle was written outside of Italy. See p. 13.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">Salute all them that have the rule over you</span>] This salutation to <span class="ital">all</span> their spiritual leaders implies the condition of Churches, which was normal at that period—namely, little communities, sometimes composed separately of Jews and Gentiles, who in default of one large central building, met for worship in each other’s houses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They of Italy</span>] This merely means “the Italians in the place from which I write,” just as “they of Asia” means Asiatic Jews (<a href="/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a>.

The phrase therefore gives no clue whatever to the place from which, or the persons to whom, the Epistle was written. It merely shews that some Christians from Italy—perhaps Christians who had fled from Italy during the Neronian persecution—formed a part of the writer’s community; but it suggests a not unnatural inference that it was written <span class="ital">to</span> some Italian community from some other town <span class="ital">out of</span> Italy. Had he been writing <span class="ital">from</span> Italy he would perhaps have been more likely to write “those <span class="ital">in</span> Italy” (comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1 Peter 5:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/13-24.htm" title="Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.">Hebrews 13:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πάντας τοὺς ἡγουμένους ὑμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">all them that have the rule over you</span>) They laboured under dulness of apprehension; but this epistle has solid food for them that are perfect. Therefore if any epistle needed to have been withdrawn from the general multitude, this certainly was that epistle. And yet this epistle too is directed to the general multitude, rather than to the ministers, to whom it was less necessary. [<span class="ital">So the discourse is addressed to women, children, servants, young men</span>, etc., <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:22</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2 John 1:1</a> : and to all together, <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1 Peter 3:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder.

They of Italy salute you.</span> The fact that no names are here mentioned, as is usual with St. Paul in sending salutations to Churches he was personally well acquainted with, leads us to infer that there had been no such close association, at any rate recently, between the writer and the readers in this case; or else that a circle of Churches in some locality is addressed. Nothing certain can be concluded as to the writer's whereabouts at the time of writing from the expression, "they of Italy (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)," though it seems to favor the idea, rather than otherwise, that he was in Italy at the time, possibly at Rome. For the phrase means simply "natives of Italy" (cf. <a href="/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a>; <a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1</a>; <a href="/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>; <a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a>; <a href="/acts/18-13.htm">Acts 18:13</a>; all these being, we observe, expressions of St. Luke's); it by no means implies that they had left Italy. In fact, as Delitzsch observes, "if the author was then in Italy, and at the same time was not a native of Italy, he could not have selected a more appropriate designation for the Italian Christians." The Epistle is concluded by St. Paul's accustomed words, which, with some variations, seem to have been appended to all his letters as his authenticating autograph (see <a href="/2_thessalonians/3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3</a>, etc.) - <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They of Italy (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x399;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>This may mean, "those who are in Italy send greeting from Italy"; or, "those of Italy (Italian Christians with the writer at the time) send greeting' from the place at which the letter is being written. See Introduction. The phrase affords no reliable indication as to the residence of the persons addressed. </body></html>
