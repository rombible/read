Here are earnest exhortations to several Christian duties, especially contentment. The sin opposed to this grace and duty is covetousness, an over-eager desire for the wealth of this world, with envy of those who have more than ourselves. Having treasures in heaven, we may be content with mean things here. Those who cannot be so, would not be content though God raised their condition. Adam was in paradise, yet not contented; some angels in heaven were not contented; but the apostle Paul, though abased and empty, had learned in every state, in any state, to be content. Christians have reason to be contented with their present lot. This promise contains the sum and substance of all the promises; I will never, no, never leave thee, no, never forsake thee. In the original there are no less than five negatives put together, to confirm the promise: the true believer shall have the gracious presence of God with him, in life, at death, and for ever. Men can do nothing against God, and God can make all that men do against his people, to turn to their good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Remember them that are in bonds - All who are "bound;" whether prisoners of war; captives in dungeons; those detained in custody for trial; those who are imprisoned for righteousness' sake, or those held in slavery. The word used here will include all instances where "bonds, shackles, chains were ever used." Perhaps there is an immediate allusion to their fellow-Christians who were suffering imprisonment on account of their religion, of whom there were doubtless many at that time, but the "principle" will apply to every case of those who are imprisoned or oppressed. The word "remember" implies more than that we are merely to "think" of them; compare <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>. It means that we are to remember them "with appropriate sympathy;" or as we should wish others to remember us if we were in their circumstances. That is, we are<p>(1) to feel deep compassion for them;<p>(2) we are to remember them in our prayers;<p>(3) we are to remember them, as far as practicable, with aid for their relief.<p>Christianity teaches us to sympathize with all the oppressed, the suffering, and the sad; and there are more of this class than we commonly suppose, and they have stronger claims on our sympathy than we commonly realize. In America there are not far from ten thousand confined in prison - the father separated from his children; the husband from his wife; the brother from his sister; and all cut off from the living world. Their fare is coarse, and their couches hard, and the ties which bound them to the living world are rudely snapped asunder. Many of them are in solitary dungeons; all of them are sad and melancholy men. True, they are there for crime; but they are men - they are our brothers. They have still the feelings of our common humanity, and many of them feel their separation from wife, and children, and home, as keenly as we would.<p>That God who has mercifully made our lot different from theirs, has commanded us to sympathize with them - and we should sympathize all the more when we remember that but for his restraining grace we should have been in the same condition. There are in this land of "liberty" also nearly three millions who are held in the hard bondage of slavery. There is the father, the mother, the child, the brother, the sister. They are held as property; liable to be sold; having no right to the avails of their own labor; exposed to the danger of having the tenderest ties sundered at the will of their master; shut out from the privilege of reading the Word of God; fed on coarse fare; living in wretched hovels; and often subjected to the painful inflictions of the lash at the caprice of a passionate driver. Wives and daughters are made the victims of degrading sensuality without the power of resistance or redress; the security of home is unknown; and they are dependent on the will of another man whether they shall or shall not worship their Creator. We should remember them, and sympathize with them as if they were our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, or sons and daughters.<p>Though of different colour, yet the same blood flows in their veins as in ours <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>; they are bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. By nature they have the same right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" which we and our children have, and to deprive them of that right is as unjust as it would be to deprive us and ours of it. They have a claim on our sympathy, for they are our brethren. They need it, for they are poor and helpless. They should have it, for the same God who has kept us from that hard lot has commanded us to remember them. That kind remembrance of them should be shown in every practicable way. By prayer; by plans contemplating their freedom; by efforts to send them the gospel; by diffusing abroad the principles of liberty and of the rights of man, by using our influence to arouse the public mind in their behalf, we should endeavor to relieve those who are in bonds, and to hasten the time when "the oppressed shall go free." On this subject, see the notes on <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>.<p>As bound with them - There is great force and beauty in this expression. Religion teaches us to identify ourselves with all who are oppressed, and to feel what they suffer as if we endured it ourselves. Infidelity and atheism are cold and distant. They stand aloof from the oppressed and the sad. But Christianity unites all hearts in one; binds us to all the race, and reveals to us in the case of each one oppressed and injured, a brother.<p>And them which suffer adversity - The word used here refers properly to those who are maltreated, or who are injured by others. It does not properly refer to those who merely experience calamity.<p>As being ourselves also in the body - As being yourselves exposed to persecution and suffering, and liable to be injured. That is, do to them as you would wish them to do to you if you were the sufferer. When we see an oppressed and injured man, we should remember that it is possible that we may be in the same circumstances, and that then we shall need and desire the sympathy of others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The motive now urged is contained in the words <span class="greekheb">ὡς συνδεδεμένοι</span>, “as having been bound with them,” as fellow-prisoners. The <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐν σώματι</span> of the next clause might invite the interpretation, “for we also are bound as well as they,” and colour might be given to this by the Epistle to Diognetus, chap. 6. <span class="greekheb">χριστιανοὶ κατέχονται μὲν ὡς ἐν φρουρᾷ τῷ κόσμῳ</span>; but more likely the expression is merely a strong way of saying that all the members of Christ’s body suffer with each, <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm" title="And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν κακουχουμένων</span>, “the maltreated,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>; you must be mindful of these “as being yourselves also in the body,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, not emancipated spirits, and therefore liable to similar ill-usage and capable of sympathy. [A striking illustration of the manner in which the early Christians obeyed these admonitions may be found in the <span class="ital">Apology</span> of Aristides: <span class="greekheb">ξένον ἐὰν ἴδωσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ στέγην εἰσάγουσι καὶ χαίρουσιν ἐπʼ αὐτῷ ὡς ἐπὶ ἀδελφῷ ἀληθινῷ</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ κατὰ σάρκα ἀδελφοὺς ἑαυτοὺς καλοῦσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ κατὰ ψυχήν</span>. The Syriac Apology adds “If they hear that any of their number is imprisoned or oppressed for the name of their Messiah, all of them provide for his needs”. Accordingly in the <span class="ital">Martyrdom</span> of Perpetua we read that two deacons were appointed to visit her and relieve the severity of her imprisonment.] It is interesting to find that Philo claims for Moses a <span class="greekheb">φιλαδεφία</span> towards strangers, enjoining sympathy, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐν διαιρετοῖς μέρεσιν ἕν ζῶον</span>, as being all one living creature though in diverse parts; and in <span class="ital">De Spec.

The expressions of the verse (<span class="greekheb">κακουχουμένων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς καὶ αὐτοὶ ὄντες ἐν σώματι</span> read like a reminiscence of Philo (<span class="ital">De Spec.

Whether or not sufferers themselves now, they must not be forgetful of those that are "As bound with them" seems best taken as expressing the sympathy of one member with another (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33, 34</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>, "If one member suffer," etc.). "As being yourselves," etc., reminds them that they are still in the flesh, and so not only on this account bound to sympathize, but also liable themselves at any time to the like afflictions. Exhortations to personal purity and to contentedness follow next. Of the need, and prominence in the Epistles, of warnings against impurity see what was said on <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>). St. Paul is given to couple covetousness 'rod uncleanness together in his warnings, as cognate sins, and alike incompatible with the kingdom of God (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>, etc.; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). Greediness, or inordinate desire (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), may be for sensual indulgence or for wealth - the same word is used in both senses; and such <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, whatever its object, is fatal to the spiritual life.
