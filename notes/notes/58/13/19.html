The apostle then states what is their duty to living ministers; to obey and submit to them, so far as is agreeable to the mind and will of God, made known in his word. Christians must not think themselves too wise, too good, or too great, to learn. The people must search the Scriptures, and so far as the ministers teach according to that rule, they ought to receive their instructions as the word of God, which works in those that believe. It is the interest of hearers, that the account their ministers give of them may be with joy, and not with grief. Faithful ministers deliver their own souls, but the ruin of a fruitless and faithless people will be upon their own heads. The more earnestly the people pray for their ministers, the more benefit they may expect from their ministry. A good conscience has respect to all God's commands, and all our duty. Those who have this good conscience, yet need the prayers of others. When ministers come to a people who pray for them, they come with greater satisfaction to themselves, and success to the people. We should seek all our mercies by prayer. God is the God of peace, fully reconciled to believers; who has made a way for peace and reconciliation between himself and sinners, and who loves peace on earth, especially in his churches. He is the Author of spiritual peace in the hearts and consciences of his people. How firm a covenant is that which has its foundation in the blood of the Son of God! The perfecting of the saints in every good work, is the great thing desired by them, and for them; and that they may at length be fitted for the employment and happiness of heaven. There is no good thing wrought in us, but it is the work of God. And no good thing is wrought in us by God, but through Christ, for his sake and by his Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That I may be restored to you the sooner - It is here clearly implied that the writer was deterred from visiting them by some adverse circumstances over which he had no control. This might be either by imprisonment, or sickness, or the want of a convenient opportunity of reaching them. The probability is, judging particularly from the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/13-23.htm">Hebrews 13:23</a>, that he was then a prisoner, and that his detention was on that account; see Introduction, section 4 (6). The language here is such as Paul would use on the supposition that he was then a prisoner at Rome, and this is a slight circumstance going to show the probability that the Epistle was composed by him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. the rather&#8212;Greek, "I the more abundantly beseech you."<p>to do this&#8212;to pray for me.<p>that I may be restored to you&#8212;(Phm 22). It is here first in the letter he mentions himself, in a way so unobtrusive, as not to prejudice his Hebrew readers against him, which would have been the result had he commenced this as his other Epistles, with authoritatively announcing his name and apostolic commission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He is the more urging and pressing them to the exercise of this duty more fervently, instantly, and abundantly, at this time, that they might prevail with God to remove hinderances by his enemies, freeing him from his chain and restraint at Rome, and to speed his liberty for a return to them, that it might be in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel. So the church prayed for Peter, and prevailed, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a></span>, and he had hopes that God would hear them for him also, <span class="bld"><a href="/philemon/1-22.htm" title="But with prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.">Philemon 1:22</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hebrews/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I beseech you the rather to do this,....

There is to be inferred from these words, neither that the author, at the time of the composition of the epistle, was a prisoner (Euthalius, Calov, Braun, Bisping, and others), nor yet that he belonged, as member, to the congregation of those to whom he was writing (R. Köstlin in the <span class="ital">Theol. Jahrb</span>. of Baur and Zeller, 1853, H. 3, pp. 423, 427, and 1854, H. 3, pp. 369, 406). The former not, because the notice, <a href="/hebrews/13-23.htm" title="Know you that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.">Hebrews 13:23</a> : <span class="greekheb">μεθʼ οὗ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν τάχιον ἔρχηται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὄψομαι ὑμᾶς</span>, shows beyond refutation that the writer at the time of the composition of the epistle was able to dispose freely of his own person. The latter not, because it is illogical to place the general notion of a “being restored” to a community upon a level with the special notion of the “return of one who has been torn from his home.” Only two things follow from the words, namely (1) from the <span class="greekheb">τάχιον</span>, that the author was still prevented, in some way or other which had nothing to do with his personal freedom, from quitting his temporary place of residence so quickly as he could wish; (2) from <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατασταθῶ</span>, that he had already, before this time, been personally present in the midst of his readers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">that I may be restored to you the sooner</span>] So St Paul in <a href="/philemon/1-22.htm" title="But with prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.">Philemon 1:22</a>.

What circumstances, whether of imprisonment or other hindrances, were in the way of his revisiting them does not appear. We remark that this verse again reminds us strongly of St. Paul (cf. <a href="/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>). The possibility may be here noted (see Introduction, p. 12.) that, if the Epistle was composed by one of St. Paul's friends, and sent under his authority, he may have himself dictated this concluding portion (beginning possibly at ver. 17) which is in a more epistolary style than the rest, and contains personal allusions. </body></html>
