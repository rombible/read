Here are earnest exhortations to several Christian duties, especially contentment. The sin opposed to this grace and duty is covetousness, an over-eager desire for the wealth of this world, with envy of those who have more than ourselves. Having treasures in heaven, we may be content with mean things here. Those who cannot be so, would not be content though God raised their condition. Adam was in paradise, yet not contented; some angels in heaven were not contented; but the apostle Paul, though abased and empty, had learned in every state, in any state, to be content. Christians have reason to be contented with their present lot. This promise contains the sum and substance of all the promises; I will never, no, never leave thee, no, never forsake thee. In the original there are no less than five negatives put together, to confirm the promise: the true believer shall have the gracious presence of God with him, in life, at death, and for ever. Men can do nothing against God, and God can make all that men do against his people, to turn to their good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers - On the duty of hospitality, see a full explanation in the notes on <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>.<p>For thereby some have entertained angels unawares - Without knowing that they were angels. As Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a> ff), and Lot did; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The motive here urged for doing it is, that by entertaining the stranger we may perhaps be honored with the presence of those whose society will be to us an honor and a blessing. It is not well for us to miss the opportunity of the presence, the conversation, and the prayers of the good. The influence of such guests in a family is worth more than it costs to entertain them. If there is danger that we may sometimes receive those of an opposite character. yet it is not wise on account of such possible danger, to lose the opportunity of entertaining those whose presence would be a blessing. Many a parent owes the conversion of a child to the influence of a pious stranger in his family; and the hope that this may occur, or that our own souls may be blessed, should make us ready, at all proper times, to welcome the feet of the stranger to our doors. Many a man, if, he had been accosted as Abraham was at the door of his tent by strangers, would have turned them rudely away; many a one in the situation of Lot would have sent the unknown guests rudely from his door; but who can estimate what would have been the results of such a course on the destiny of those good people and their families?

By whom are meant, not unconverted men, who are strangers to God and Christ, and the covenants of promise; nor saints, who are as pilgrims and strangers in this world; but such as are of another country, and are unknown; and even though wicked men, they are not excluded; though such as are obliged to quit their own country for righteousness sake are chiefly designed; all strangers in distress are meant, and hospitality is to be exercised towards them; which lies negatively in doing nothing to distress them, and positively in providing food, raiment, lodging, &amp;c. for them, and in comforting, counselling, and directing them in all matters in which they may stand in need thereof: and that this is a duty, appears from the light of nature, and practices of the Heathens, <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/28-2.htm">Acts 28:2</a>, from the express law of God, <a href="/deuteronomy/10-19.htm">Deuteronomy 10:19</a> and many others made in favour of strangers, binding on the Jews; from the sundry exhortations to it in the New Testament, <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a> and from the exhortation here not to forget it; and from the great regard which Christ will show to such as mind it, and his disregard to others at the last day: the persons who are to exercise it are not only the ministers of the Gospel, who should be given to hospitality; but all the saints, even the meaner sort are not exempted, but should use it according to their ability; though it is chiefly binding on those that are rich. And this should not be forgot, but pursued and followed after; it should be frequently performed; men should be given, and used to it; it should be done without grudging, and in a friendly and loving manner: <p>for thereby some have entertained angels unawares; as Abraham, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>, he knew them not to be angels at first; they appeared as men, and he treated them as such; but they were angels, yea, one of them was Jehovah himself; and hereby he received many favours, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>, and Lot, <a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a> who knew not that they were angels he took into his house; but they were, and he was delivered by them from the burning of Sodom; yea, some have unawares, this way, entertained Christ himself, <a href="/luke/24-15.htm">Luke 24:15</a> and indeed, entertaining of his members is entertaining him, <a href="/matthew/25-38.htm">Matthew 25:38</a>.

The absence of places of public entertainment except in the larger towns, and the constant interchange of letters and messages between Christian communities—a happy practice which also prevailed among the Jewish Synagogues—made “hospitality” a very necessary and blessed practice. St Peter tells Christians to be hospitable to one another ungrudgingly, and unmurmuringly, though it must sometimes have been burdensome (<a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1 Peter 4:9</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/titus/1-8.htm" title="But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;">Titus 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>).

Possibly some of the wavering Hebrew Christians might be becoming less ready to open their doors to the persecuted from fear of "reproach" in Jewish circles. The allusion of the latter part of the verse is evidently to Abraham and Lot (<a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. and 19.). At any time the visits even of our fellow-men may be to us as visits of angels, as being messengers of God's purposes for good when least expected. And especially to be noted are our Lord's own words, "He that receiveth you receiveth me," etc., and "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>Lit. be not forgetful of hospitality. &#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; only here and <a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>. olxx. &#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; hospitable, <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="/titus/1-8.htm">Titus 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>.

Rom. Ad Corinth. x., xi., xii. The virtue of hospitality is not distinctively Christian. It appears with the very beginnings of history, largely as the result of nomadic conditions. It was peculiarly an Oriental virtue. In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, commendatory judgment is awarded to him who has fed the hungry and clothed the naked. The O.T. abounds in illustrations, and the practice of hospitality among the Arabs and Bedoueen is familiar through the writings of travelers in the East. Great stress was laid on the duty by the Greeks, as appears constantly in Homer and elsewhere. Hospitality was regarded as a religious duty. The stranger was held to be under the special protection of Zeus, who was called &#x3be;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the God of the stranger. The Romans regarded any violation of the rites of hospitality as impiety. Cicero says: "It seems to me eminently becoming that the homes of distinguished men should be open to distinguished guests, and that it is an honor to the Republic that foreigners should not lack this kind of liberality in our city" (De Off. ii.18).<p>Have entertained angels unawares (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;)<p>The Greek idiom is, "were not apparent as entertaining angels."
