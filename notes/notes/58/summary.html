This, in essence, is what the book of Hebrews is all about. Let us imagine a conversation between a Hindu and a Christian. The Hindu listens intently as the Christian briefly summarizes the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ. At the conclusion of the message, four basic questions might quickly come to his mind.<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>Question:</i> Why did Jesus have to be born?<p class="ita"><i>Answer: “No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him”</i> (Jn. 1:18).<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>Question:</i> Why did Jesus have to die?<p class="ita"><i>Answer: “Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father”</i> (Gal. 1:4).<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>Question:</i> Why did Jesus have to be resurrected?<p class="ita"><i>Answer: “And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain”</i> (1 Cor. 15:14).<p class="spc"></p><p class="ita"><i>Question:</i> Why did Jesus have to ascend?<p class="ita"><i>Answer:</i> The book of Hebrews.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who?
