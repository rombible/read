It was but for a little while that the person of Christ, in the nature of man, was brought into a condition more indigent than that to which the nature of angels is exposed: neither was he for that season made a little, but very much lower than the angels. And had this been the whole of his state, it could not have been an effect of that inexpressible love which the psalmist so admires. But, seeing it was but for a short season, and that for the blessed ends which the apostle speaks of, nothing could more commend it to us.” <span class="ital">Thou crownedst him with glory and honour </span>— That is, not only man at his first creation, to whom God gave dominion over the creatures, but also, and more especially, Jesus, after his resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven. Jesus was covered with the greatest ignominy when he was crucified by the Jews as a deceiver, for calling himself Christ the Son of God. But at his resurrection and subsequent exaltation that ignominy was entirely removed; and his fame, and name, and honour, as the Son of God, were, in the most illustrious manner, restored to him. See <a href="/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:...">Php 2:9-11</a>. <span class="ital">And didst set him over the work of thy hands </span>— As Ruler and Lord of all; namely, in a lower sense Adam when created, and more eminently Christ when raised from the dead, and set at God’s own right hand.

And what is the moving cause of all the kindness God shows to men in giving Christ for them and to them? it is the grace of God. As a reward of Christ's humiliation in suffering death, he has unlimited dominion over all things; thus this ancient scripture was fulfilled in him. Thus God has done wonderful things for us in creation and providence, but for these we have made the basest returns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels - Margin, "A little while inferior to." The Greek may here mean a little inferior in rank, or inferior for a little time. But the probable meaning is, that it refers to inferiority of rank. Such is its obvious sense in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-9</a>, from which this is quoted. The meaning is, that God had made man but little inferior to the angels in rank. He was inferior, but still God had exalted him almost to their rank. Feeble, and weak, and dying as he was, God had exalted him, and had given him a dominion and a rank almost like that of the angels. The wonder of the Psalmist is, that God had given to human nature so much honor - a wonder that is not at all diminished when we think of the honor done to man by his connection with the divine nature in the person of the Lord Jesus. If in contemplating the race as it appears; if when we look at the dominion of man over the lower world, we are amazed that God has bestowed so much honor on our nature, how much more should we wonder that he has honored man by his connection with the divinity. Paul applies this to the Lord Jesus. His object is to show that he is superior to the angels. In doing this he shows that he had a nature given him in itself but little inferior to the angels, and then that that had been exalted to a rank and dominion far above theirs. That such honor should be put on "man" is what is suited to excite amazement, and well may one continue to ask why it has been done? When we survey the heavens, and contemplate their glories, and think of the exalted rank of other beings, we may well inquire why has such honor been conferred on man?<p>Thou crownedst him with glory and honor. - That is, with exalted honor. Glory and honor here are nearly synonymous. The meaning is, that elevated honor had been conferred on human nature. A most exalted and extended dominion had been given to "man," which showed that God had greatly honored him. This appeared eminently in the person of the Lord Jesus, "the exalted Man," to whom this dominion was given in the widest extent.<p>And didst set him over ... - "Man" has been placed over the other works of God:<p>(1) by the original appointment <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>;<p>(2) man at large - though fallen, sinful, feeble, dying;<p>(3) man, eminently in the person of the Lord Jesus, in whom human nature has received its chief exaltation. This is what is particularly in the eye of the apostle - and the language of the Psalm will accurately express this exaltation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. a little&#8212;not as Bengel, "a little time."<p>than the angels&#8212;Hebrew, "than God," "Elohim," that is, the abstract qualities of God, such as angels possess in an inferior form; namely, heavenly, spiritual, incorporeal natures.

So the man Jesus, though Lord of angels, when He emptied Himself of the externals of His Divinity (see on [2544]Php 2:6, 7), was in His human nature "a little lower than the angels"; though this is not the primary reference here, but man in general.<p>crownedst him with glory and honour&#8212;as the appointed kingly vicegerent of God over this earth (Ge 1:1-2:25).<p>and didst set him over the works of thy hands&#8212;omitted in some of the oldest manuscripts; but read by others and by oldest versions: so Ps 8:6, "Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou madest him:</span> ’ Hlattwsav, so diminished, as it supposed the subject to be in a higher condition before: this no man ever was, but the man Christ Jesus: see <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7</a>,8</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A little lower than the angels:</span> bpacu ti, may refer to his condition, and to the duration of it.

In the Hebrew text it is, "than Elohim", which some render, "than God"; but it is rightly rendered by the apostle, "than angels"; and so the Targum, Jarchi, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, interpret it. Christ was made a little lower than the angels, through the assumption of the human nature, which is inferior to angels, especially the corporeal part of it, and in this Kimchi makes the lessening to be; and more especially as that was assumed by Christ, with the infirmities of it; and by reason of the straits and indigencies he was brought into in it; besides, he was in it made under the law, which was given by angels, and to some parts of which they are not subject; and sometimes he stood in need of the ministry and support of angels, and had it; particularly he was made lower than they, when he was deprived of the gracious presence of God, and in the time of his sufferings and death; and which seem chiefly to be respected, as appears from <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> and the word "little" may not so much intend the degree of his humiliation, as the duration of it; for it may be rendered, "a little while"; in which sense it is used in <a href="/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a> as the Hebrew word is in <a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a> and so may respect the time of his suffering death; and at most the time from his incarnation to his resurrection; for he could not continue long in this low estate, which is matter of joy to us; he could not be held by the cords of death, but must rise, and be exalted above angels, as he is: and he was made so low by God, Jehovah the Father, whose name is excellent in all the earth, <a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a> he preordained him to this low estate; he prepared a body for him, and had a very great hand in his sufferings and death; though neither of these were contrary to his will: <p>thou crownest him with glory and honour; with that glory he had with the Father before the world was, and which followed upon his sufferings and death; for through them he entered into it, and upon his resurrection had it, and he is ascended on high, where he has the honour to sit at the right hand of God, which none of the angels have; and therefore is now above them, though once for a while below them, and they are now subject to him: <p>and didst set him over the works of thy hands: over angels, principalities, and powers; over the kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of it, and all things in it, and made him higher than the heavens, and gave him a name above every name. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</span><p>(i) This is the first honour of the citizens of the world to come, that they are beside the angels.<p>(k) For they will be greatly honoured when they partake of the kingdom.

The sense of the Hebrew is: “Thou hast made Him only a little lower than God, hast made Him only a little less than God.” The <span class="greekheb">βραχύ τι</span> is consequently in the original a note of degree, and the whole former member <span class="greekheb">ἠλάττωσας</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀγγέλους</span> contains in the original the same thought as the immediately following <span class="greekheb">δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφάνωσας αὐτόν</span>. The author, however, takes the <span class="greekheb">βραχύ τι</span> of the LXX. in the temporal sense: “for a short time” (comp. <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>), and finds in the second member an opposition to the first, in such wise that in the application he refers the statement of the first clause to the humiliation of Christ, that of the second to the exaltation of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words following these in the LXX. (as also in the Hebrew): <span class="greekheb">καὶ κατέστησας αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σου</span> (comp. the critical remarks), have been left out by the author as unsuitable to his presentment. For the statement that God has set the Son of man or the Messiah over the works of creation which proceeded from the hands of God, might appear to contain a contradiction to <a href="/hebrews/1-10.htm" title="And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:">Hebrews 1:10</a> (comp. also <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>), where earth and heaven were designated as works created by the hands of the Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7</a>. That God has been mindful of man and visited him is apparent in the three particulars now mentioned. <span class="greekheb">βραχύ τι</span> is “a little,” either in material, or in space, or in time. In <a href="/1_samuel/14-29.htm" title="Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.">1 Samuel 14:29</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγευσάμην βραχύ τι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μέλιτος</span>. In <a href="/isaiah/57-17.htm" title="For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.">Isaiah 57:17</a>, of time, <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἁμαρτίαν βραχύ τι ἐλύπησα αὐτον</span>. So in N.T., of aterial, <a href="/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7</a>; of space, <a href="/acts/27-28.htm" title="And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.">Acts 27:28</a>; of time <a href="/acts/5-34.htm" title="Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;">Acts 5:34</a>. So in classics, <span class="ital">v</span>. Bleek. The original of the psalm points to the translation: “Thou didst make him little lower than the angels” [in the Heb. <span class="greekheb">מֵאֱלֹהִים</span> “than God”]. There seems no reason to depart from this meaning either in this verse or in <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>. So Alford and Westcott, but Davidson and Weiss and several others are of opinion that as the words are in <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a> applied to the Messiah, whose superiority has been so insisted upon, an allusion to His inferiority would be out of place; “and that the phrase should be used of degree in one place and time in another, when the point of the passage lies in the identity of the Son’s history with that of man, is an idea only puerile” (Davidson). But on any rendering the inferiority of Jesus to angels so far as dying goes is granted, and there is no reason why the sense of degree should not be kept in both clauses. <span class="greekheb">δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ</span> frequently conjoined, <a href="/revelation/21-26.htm" title="And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.">Revelation 21:26</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.

The writer was only acquainted with the LXX. and in Greek the <span class="greekheb">βραχύ τι</span> would naturally suggest brevity of time (comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-10.htm" title="But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.">1 Peter 5:10</a>). Some of the Old Greek translators who took the other meaning rendered <span class="greekheb">ὄλιγος παρὰ θεόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">than the angels</span>] The original has “than <span class="ital">Elohim</span>,” i.e. than God; but the name <span class="ital">Elohim</span> has, as we have seen, a much wider and lower range than “Jehovah,” and the rendering “angels” is here found both in the LXX. and the Targum. It must be borne in mind that the writer is only applying the words of the Psalm, and putting them as it were to a fresh use. The Psalm is “a lyric echo of the first chapter of Genesis” “and speaks of man’s exaltation. The author is applying it to man’s lowliness (“ad suum institutum deflectit,” says Calvin, “<span class="greekheb">κατ</span>' <span class="greekheb">ἐπεξεργασίαν</span>”). Yet David’s notion, like that of Cicero, is that “Man is a mortal God,” and the writer is only touching on man’s humiliation to illustrate his exaltation of the God-Man. See Perowne on <span class="ital">the Psalms</span> (1. 144).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and didst set him over the works of thy hands</span>] This clause is probably a gloss from the LXX., as it is absent from some of the best MSS. and Versions (e.g. B and the Syriac).

And Peter said, Man, I am not.">Luke 22:58</a>.—<span class="greekheb">παρʼ ἀγγέλους</span>) In <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm" title="You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet:">Psalm 8:6</a>, the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">ותחסרהו מעט מאלהים</span> has this meaning: Thou hast made the Son of Man to be a little less than God, that is, than Himself. The beautiful paraphrase of Christopher Corner is as follows: Christ having become man, humbled Himself under the cross, and abased Himself BELOW GOD, when the Divine nature remaining quiescent, and not exerting its power, God Himself and the Lord of Glory was crucified and put to death.—Expos. Psalm, p. 24. This is the force of Mem prefixed, <a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-14.htm" title="As many were astonished at you; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:">Isaiah 52:14</a>. See Nold. Concord. on this particle, § 21. Mem following <span class="greekheb">מחסר</span> itself, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm" title="There is one alone, and there is not a second; yes, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither said he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yes, it is a sore travail.">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>. This mode of expression we find in another of Paul’s phrases: <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὢν ἶσα Θεῷ</span> and <span class="greekheb">κενώσας ἑαυτὸν</span>; <a href="/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Php 2:6-7</a>, note. But Paul retains the interpretation of the LXX interpreters as suited to his purpose; for the homonymy[11] of the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">אלהים</span> signifies an invisible nature, and therefore, whether angelic or divine, superior to the human nature; and He, who was made lower than the angels, was certainly made lower than GOD: but He as it were anew supplies the appellation, GOD, in ch. <a href="/hebrews/3-4.htm" title="For every house is built by some man; but he that built all things is God.">Hebrews 3:4</a>. For so the apostle is accustomed to use appropriately to his purpose the words of the LXX interpreters, and to bring before the reader anew the force of the Hebrew words, when they are more to his purpose; ch. <a href="/hebrews/10-8.htm" title="Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;">Hebrews 10:8</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm" title="For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and whips every son whom he receives.">Hebrews 12:6</a>, notes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[11] Things differing in nature called by one name by analogy. Append.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hebrews/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels</span>. Here the LXX. takes <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (being a plural form) to mean "angels;" as also in <a href="/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a> and Psalms 138:1. The more correct rendering of the Hebrew may be, "thou reddest him a little short of God," with reference to his having been made "in God's image," "after God's likeness," and having dominion over creation given him. But, if so, <span class="accented">Elohim</span> must be understood in its abstract sense of "Divinity" (so Genesis), rather than as denoting the Supreme Being. Otherwise, "thyself" would have been the more appropriate expression, the psalm being addressed to God. The argument is not affected by the difference of translation. Indeed, the latter rendering enhances still more the position assigned to man. <span class="cmt_word">Thou crownedst him with glory and worship, and didst set him over the works of thy hands</span>. The latter clause of this sentence, which is found in the LXX., but not in the Hebrew, is omitted in several codices. It is not wanted for the purpose of the argument. </body></html>
