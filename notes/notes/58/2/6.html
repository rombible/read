As a rule, the words of Scripture are in this Epistle quoted as God’s own utterances; and though the nature of the quotation (which is an address to God) made this impossible here, the writer seems gladly to avoid the mention of the human prophet, perhaps as distracting the thought from the divine prophecy. This studious indefiniteness in citation is common in Philo, and sometimes occurs where he cannot possibly have been in doubt as to the source of his quotation.<p><span class= "bld">Testified.</span>—That is, in Biblical usage, <span class= "ital">solemnly declared</span>: the words are no light exclamation of wonder. The quotation which follows (from <a href="/context/psalms/8-4.htm" title="What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you visit him?">Psalm 8:4-6</a>) agrees verbally with the LXX. version. The only point of doubt is whether the last clause of <a href="/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7</a> was included in the quotation, as in some very good ancient authorities it is absent from the text. The weight of external evidence is certainly in its favour; but it is easier to see how a scribe may have introduced the clause through his familiarity with the Psalm than to explain its omission if it stood in the original text of this Epistle. The Greek translation here faithfully represents the Hebrew, except in one point. For “a little lower than the angels,” the Hebrew text has “a little less than God.” The change (which is similar to that noticed in <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>) was probably introduced by the translators on a principle which we may often trace in their work—a wish to tone down expressions relating to the Deity which seemed strong or bold. In quoting the passage the writer does not depart from the rendering most familiar to the readers of the Greek Bible; but, though the clause in its altered form accords well with what had preceded the quotation, and, so to speak, more completely interweaves the words of the Psalm with the context in which they are here placed, yet no stress is laid on “angels.” The argument of this section would not be affected materially if the true rendering of the Hebrew were restored. The eighth Psalm is an expression of amazement that God, who has “set His glory upon the heavens,” should deign to remember man. Not only is He “mindful of man,” but He has made him but “little less than God,” “crowned him with honour,” given him “dominion over” all His works. The original blessing pronounced on man (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>) is clearly in the Psalmist’s thought, and suggests his words. The language which here precedes (<a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm" title="For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.">Hebrews 2:5</a>) and follows (<a href="/hebrews/2-8.htm" title="You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.">Hebrews 2:8</a>) shows that the last clause (“thou didst subject all things under his feet”) bears the stress of the quotation. (That the same words are the groundwork of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24-28</a> is one of the most interesting coincidences between this Epistle and St. Paul.) It is easy to see, therefore, for what purpose these verses are here adduced. Not to angels is “the world to come” subjected: in the Scripture there are found words declaring that a divine decree has subjected all things to <span class= "ital">man.</span> How the thought is combined with the argument of the whole passage will be seen in <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>. A question at once arises: Did the meaning here assigned to the Psalm exist in David’s thought? If not, on what principle does this application rest? David had in mind the words of the primal blessing, and probably did not himself think of more than those words seemed to imply. But the complete meaning of God’s words can be learnt only when they are fulfilled in history. To Him who speaks in Scripture the material dominion was the symbol of a higher and a universal rule, to be fulfilled in the Son of Man when the fulness of time should come. The Psalm is not directly Messianic,—it relates to man; but it is through the Man Christ Jesus that it receives its complete fulfilment for mankind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?">Hebrews 2:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">But one in a certain place </span>— Namely, David, <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm" title="What is man, that you are mindful of him? and the son of man, that you visit him?">Psalm 8:4</a>; <span class="ital">testified, saying, What is man </span>— The Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">אנושׁ</span>, used in the Psalm, means <span class="ital">weak, miserable, </span>and <span class="ital">mortal man; </span>man in his fallen state; obnoxious to grief, sorrow, anxiety, pain, trouble, and death: <span class="ital">that thou art mindful of him — </span>What is he to the vast expanse of the heavens, to <span class="ital">the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained? </span>This Psalm seems to have been composed by David in a clear, moon-shiny, and star-light night, while he was contemplating the wonderful fabric of the heaven; because, in his magnificent description of its luminaries, he takes no notice of the sun, the most glorious of them all. The words here cited concerning dominion, were doubtless in some sense applicable to Adam; although, in their complete and highest sense, they belong to none but the second Adam. It has indeed been a great question among interpreters, whether the Psalm speaks of man in general, and of the honour which God put upon him in his creation, or only of the man Christ Jesus. But upon comparing the contents of it with this chapter, it seems evident that both are included. For the design of the Psalm appears plainly to have been to display and celebrate the great love and kindness of God to mankind: not only in their creation, but also in their redemption by Christ Jesus; whom, as he was man, God advanced to the honour here spoken of, that he might carry on that great and glorious work. Some parts of the Psalm, however, relate more eminently to Christ than to man in general, and accordingly are so interpreted, both by our Lord and by his apostles, particularly <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?">Hebrews 2:6</a>. <span class="ital">Or the Son of man </span>— Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">בן אדם</span>, <span class="ital">the son of Adam, </span>of one made out of the earth; <span class="ital">that thou visitest him </span>— The sense rises: we are <span class="ital">mindful </span>of him that is absent; but to <span class="ital">visit </span>denotes the care of one present. And it is worthy of observation, that the Hebrew word occurring in the Psalm, and rendered <span class="ital">visitest, </span>though variously used, yet constantly denotes the action of a superior toward an inferior, and commonly expresses some act of God toward his people for good. And especially in the term <span class="ital">visiting </span>used to express the stupendous act of God in sending his Son to take our nature upon him, as <a href="/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>; <a href="/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>. “He hath <span class="ital">visited </span>and redeemed his people;” and “The day-spring from on high hath <span class="ital">visited </span>us.” This was the ground of the psalmist’s admiration, and will be a cause of admiration to all believers through eternal ages.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-9 Neither the state in which the church is at present, nor its more completely restored state, when the prince of this world shall be cast out, and the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdom of Christ, is left to the government of the angels: Christ will take to him his great power, and will reign. And what is the moving cause of all the kindness God shows to men in giving Christ for them and to them? it is the grace of God. As a reward of Christ's humiliation in suffering death, he has unlimited dominion over all things; thus this ancient scripture was fulfilled in him. Thus God has done wonderful things for us in creation and providence, but for these we have made the basest returns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But one in a certain place testified - The apostle was writing to those who were supposed to be familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures, and where it would be necessary only to make a reference in general without mentioning the name. The place which is quoted here is <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4-6</a>. The "argument" of the apostle is this, that there stood in the sacred Scriptures a declaration that "all things were placed under the control and jurisdiction of man," but that that had not yet been accomplished. It was not true (<a href="/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a>) that all things were subject to him, and the complete truth of that declaration would be found only in the jurisdiction conferred on the Messiah - the man by way of eminence - the incarnate Son of God. It would not occur to anyone probably in reading the Psalm that the verse here quoted had any reference to the Messiah. It seems to relate to the dominion which God had given man over his works in this lower world, or to the fact that he was made lord over all things.<p>That dominion is apparent, to a considerable extent, everywhere, and is a standing proof of the truth of what is recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, that God originally gave dominion to man over the creatures on earth, since it is only by this supposition that it can be accounted for that the horse, and the elephant, and the ox, and even the panther and the lion, are subject to the control of man. The argument of Paul seems to be this: Originally this control was given to man. It was absolute and entire. All things were subject to him, and all obeyed. Man was made a little lower than the angels, and was the undisputed lord of this lower world. He was in a state of innocence. But he rebelled, and this dominion has been in some measure lost. It is found complete only in the "second man the Lord from heaven" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-47.htm">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>, the Lord Jesus to whom this control is absolutely given. He comes up to the complete idea of man - man as he was in innocence, and man as he was described by the Psalmist, as having been made a little lower than the angels, and having entire dominion over the world.<p>Much difficulty has been felt by commentators in regard to this passage, and to the principle on which it is quoted. The above seems to me to be what is most probably true. There are two other methods by which an attempt has been made to explain it. One is, that Paul uses the words here by way of "allusion," or "accommodation" (Doddridge), as words that will express his meaning, without designing to say that the Psalm originally had any reference to the Messiah. Most of the later commentators accord with this opinion. The other opinion is, that David originally referred to the Messiah - that he was deeply and gratefully affected in view of the honor that God had conferred on him; and that in looking down by faith on the posterity that God had promised him (see <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), he saw one among his own descendants to whom God would give this wide dominion, and expresses himself in the elevated language of praise. This opinion is defended by Prof. Stuart; see his Commentary on Hebrews, Excursus IX.<p>(That the grand and ultimate reference, in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-9</a>, is to the person of the Messiah, none can reasonably doubt. Both our Lord and his apostles have affirmed it; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-15.htm">Matthew 21:15-16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>. Add to these, the place before us, where - as the quotation is introduced "in the midst of an argument, and by way of proof" - the idea of "accommodation" is inconsistent with the wisdom and honesty of the apostles, and therefore inadmissible. The opposite extreme, however, of "sole and original" reference to the Messiah is not so certain. There is a more obvious and primary reference, which at once strikes the reader of the Psalm, and which, therefore, should not be rejected, until disproved. The conjecture, which a learned author mentioned above, has made, regarding the course of thought in the Psalmist's mind, supposing him to have been occupied with the contemplation of the covenant, as recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> and of that illustrious descendant, who should be the Son of God, and on whom should be conferred universal empire - at the very time in which he composed the Psalm - is ingenious, but not satisfactory.<p>The least objectionable view is that of primary and secondary, or prophetic reference. This relieves us from the necessity of setting aside the obvious sense of the original place, and, at the same time, preserves the more exalted sense, which our Lord and his apostles have attached to it, and the Spirit of course intended to convey. And in order to preserve this last sense, it is not necessary to ascertain what was the course of feeling in the Psalmist's mind, or whether "he" really had the Messiah in view, since the prophets, on many occasions, might be ignorant of the full import of the words which the Holy Ghost dictated to them. This view, moreover, is all that the necessity of the case demands. It suits the apostle's argument, since the great and prophetic reference is to the Messiah. It presents, also, a complete &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  ple&#772;ro&#772;sis of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-9</a>, which it is allowed on all hands the primary reference alone could not do. It is sufficiently clear that such universal dominion belongs not to man, in his present fallen state. Even if it be allowed that the contemplation of David regarded "man as innocent, as he was when created," yet absolutely universal dominion did not belong to Adam. Christ alone is Lord of all. Creation animate and inanimate is subject to him.<p>Here then we have what has been well styled: "the safe middle point, the &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  metron ariston, between the two extremes of supposing this, and such like passages, to belong only to the Messiah, or only to him concerning whom they were first spoken." This middle point has been ably defended by Dr. Middleton. "Indeed." says he, "on no other hypothesis can we avoid one of two great difficulties; for else we must assert that the multitudes of applications made by Christ and his apostles are fanciful and unauthorized, and wholly inadequate to prove the points for which they are cited; or, on the other band, we must believe that the obvious and natural sense of such passages was never intended, and that it is a mere illusion. Of <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-9</a> the primary import is so certain that it could not be mistaken." The only objection to this double reference, worthy of being noticed, is connected with the clause, &#x397;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  E&#772;latto&#772;sas auton brachuti par angelous, which, it is affirmed, must possess two senses, not only different, but opposite and contradictory.<p>In its primary application to man, the idea is plainly that of exaltation and honor. Such was the dignity of man that he was made "but a little" lower than the angels; on the other hand, the secondary, or prophetic application, gives to the language the sense of humiliation or depression. For, considering the original dignity of Christ, the being made lower than the angels, cannot otherwise be regarded. But may not the clause, in both applications, have the idea of exaltation attached to it? If so, the objection is at once met. And that this is the case has, we think, been satisfactorily made out. "What," asks Prof. Stuart "is his (Paul's) design?" To prove that Christ in his human nature is exalted above angels. How does he undertake to prove this? First by showing that this nature is made but little inferior to that of the angels, and next that it has been exalted to the empire of the world." This note has been extended to such length, because it involves a "principle" applicable to a multitude of passages. On the whole, it may be observed in reference to all these cases of quotation, that the mind of the pious and humble reader will not be greatly distressed by any difficulties connected with their application, but will ever rest satisfied with the assertion and authority of people, who spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.)<p>What is man ... - What is there in man that entitles him to so much notice? Why has God conferred on him so signal honors? Why has he placed him over the works of his hands? He seems so insignificant; his life is so much like a vapor; he so soon disappears, that the question may well be asked why this extraordinary dominion is given him? He is so sinful also, and so unworthy; so much unlike God, and so passionate and revengeful; is so prone to abuse his dominion, that it may well be asked why God has given it to him? Who would suppose that God would give such a dominion over his creatures to one who was so prone to abuse it as man has shown himself to be? He is so feeble, also, compared with other creatures - even of those which are made subject to him - that the question may well be asked why God has conceded it to him? Such question may be asked when we contemplate man as he is. But similar questions may be asked, if, as was probably the case, the Psalm here be supposed to have had reference to man "as he was created."<p>Why was one so feeble, and so comparatively without strength, placed over this lower world, and the earth made subject to his control? Why is it that when the heavens are so vast and glorious <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>, God has taken such notice of man? Of what consequence can he be amidst works so wonderful? "When I look on the heavens and survey their greatness and their glory," is the sentiment of David, "why is it that man has attracted so much notice, and that he has not been wholly overlooked in the vastness of the works of the Almighty? Why is it that instead of this he has been exalted to so much dignity and honor?" This question, thus considered, strikes us with more force now than it could have struck David. Let anyone sit down and contemplate the heavens as they are disclosed by the discoveries of modern astronomy, and he may well ask the question, "What is man that he should have attracted the attention of God, and been the object of so much care?"<p>The same question would not have been inappropriate to David if the Psalm be supposed to have had reference originally to the Messiah, and if he was speaking of himself particularly as the ancestor of the Messiah. "What is man; what am I; what can any of my descendants be, who must be of mortal frame, that this dominion should be given him? Why should anyone of a race so feeble, so ignorant, so imperfect, be exalted to such honor?" We may ask the question here, and it may be asked in heaven with pertinency and with power, 'Why was man so honored as to be united to the Godhead? Why did the Deity appear in the human form? What was there in man that should entitle him to this honor of being united to the Divinity, and of being thus exalted above the angels?' The wonder is not yet solved; and we may well suppose that the angelic ranks look with amazement - but without envy - on the fact that "man," by his union with the Deity in the person of the Lord Jesus, has been raised above them in rank and in glory. "Or the son of man." This phrase means the same as "man," and is used merely to give variety to the mode of expression. Such a change or variety in words and phrases, when the same thing is intended, occurs constantly in Hebrew poetry. The name "son of man" is often given to Christ to denote his intimate connection with our race, and the interest which he felt in us, and is the common term which the Saviour uses when speaking of himself. Here it means "man," and maybe applied to human nature everywhere - and therefore to human nature in the person of the Messiah.<p>That thou visitest him - That thou shouldst regard him or treat him with so much honor. Why is he the object of so much interest to the Divine Mind? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. But&#8212;It is not to angels the Gospel kingdom is subject, BUT &#8230;<p>one &#8230; testified&#8212;the usual way of quoting Scripture to readers familiar with it. Ps 8:5-7 praises Jehovah for exalting MAN, so as to subject all the works of God on earth to him: this dignity having been lost by the first Adam, is realized only in Christ the Son of man, the Representative Man and Head of our redeemed race. Thus Paul proves that it is to MAN, not to angels, that God has subjected the "world to come." In Heb 2:6-8, MAN is spoken of in general ("him &#8230; him &#8230; his); then at Heb 2:9, first Jesus is introduced as fulfilling, as man, all the conditions of the prophecy, and passing through death Himself; and so consequently bringing us men, His "brethren," to "glory and honor."<p>What, &c.&#8212;How insignificant in himself, yet how exalted by God's grace!

But the eighth Psalm, here cited, is, both in the Hebrew and the LXX., expressly ascribed to David. According to Koppe (<span class="ital">Excursus I. ad epist. ad Roman.</span>, 2d ed. p. 379), Dindorf, Schulz, Heinrichs (comp. also Stengel), the indefiniteness of the formula is to be explained by the fact that the author is citing from memory. But the words agree too exactly with the LXX. to be a citation from memory, and, moreover, the indefinite <span class="greekheb">που</span> occurs again, <a href="/hebrews/4-4.htm" title="For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.">Hebrews 4:4</a>, in connection with the citation of <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2</a>, thus in connection with an appeal to a passage of the O. T. Scripture, of which the place where it is found could not possibly escape the memory of our author. De Wette, after the precedent of Bleek [cf. Peshito: <span class="ital">the Scripture witnesses, and says</span>], regards it as the most correct supposition that the author “was not concerned about the particular writers of Scripture, since for him God or the Holy Ghost spoke through the Scripture.” Yet, if the reason for the form of expression is to be sought in this, then in general we should hardly expect the personal indication <span class="greekheb">τίς</span> to be added, but rather a passive construction to be chosen. According to Hofmann, finally, ̔<span class="greekheb">πού τις</span> is intended to declare “that it is indeed a matter of indifference for his purpose who said this, and where it is found; that it is adduced as the utterance of <span class="ital">some</span> man, only an utterance which comes invested with the authority of Scripture!” The indefinite mode of citation has probably no other than a rhetorical ground, inasmuch as the author presupposes a universal acquaintance with the passage, without concerning himself to learn whether it is known to all or not. So substantially also Chrysostom (<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο δὲ αὐτό</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἶμαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ κρύπτειν καὶ μὴ τιθέναι τὸν εἰρηκότα τὴν μαρτυρίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὡς περιφερομένην καὶ κατάδηλον οὖσαν εἰσάγειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">δεικνύντος ἐστίν</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὺς σφόδρα ἐμπείρους εἶναι τῶν γραφῶν</span>), Oecumenius, Theophylact, Primasius, Jac. Cappellus, Cornelius a Lapide [Owen: “the reason is plain; both person and place were sufficiently known to them to whom he wrote”], Calov, Tholuck, Bloomfield, Alford, Maier, Moll, Kurtz, <span class="ital">al</span>. The same reticence in the mode of citation is often found with Philo. Comp. <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <span class="ital">de ebrietate</span>, p. 248 (ed.

The utterance in its historic sense contains a declaration with regard to man in general; but the author, on the ground of the ideal import of the passage, as likewise in particular on the ground of the expression <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου</span>, which in consequence of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a> was current with the Jews as an appellation of the Messiah (comp. <a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>), which, too, was one often bestowed by Jesus upon Himself, finds in it a declaration concerning the Son of man <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐξοχήν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> concerning Christ.[44] Paul, too, has Messianically interpreted the psalm, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet.

Thus the author <span class="ital">could</span> understand the words, although the “being mindful” and “looking upon” do not very well accord therewith, in that he was guided in his acceptance of them pre-eminently by the final clause <span class="greekheb">δόξῃ</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἤ</span>] instead of this <span class="greekheb">ו</span> is found in the Hebrew, thus introduces a purely parallel member, in such wise that <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου</span> is identical with <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span> in the first member, and is distinguished therefrom only as a more sharply defined presentation of the same notion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[44] In contradiction with the design of the whole explication, as this clearly manifests itself from the context, do Beza, Piscator, Storr, Ebrard, Delitzsch (p. 57, 59), Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 45, 2 Aufl.), Alford, Moll, and others, refer <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span>, even in the sense of our author, and <span class="greekheb">νἱὸς ἀνθρώπου</span> to <span class="ital">man generally</span>, namely, to the man of the New Covenant, inasmuch as he <span class="ital">shall</span> receive the dominion over all things, in the possession of which Christ is already set. When Ebrard, p. 84, asserts that the “Messianic” interpretation “of the non-Messianic eighth Psalm” cannot be laid to the account of the author of the epistle, without charging him with “a downright Rabbinical misunderstanding of a psalm;” and when, in like manner, Delitzsch, p. 57, declares it “not at all conceivable that the author of our epistle should without any explanation have referred <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span> and <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου</span> of the psalm <span class="ital">to Christ</span>,” unless we are to attribute “the uttermost limitation of thought to the N. T. exposition of Scripture,” that is nothing else than a controlling of the author of the epistle by preconceived opinions of one’s own, from which, in the face of <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.">1 Corinthians 15:27</a> f., one ought to have shrunk.

This indefinite mode of quotation (“some one, somewhere”) is common in Philo and the Rabbis. Scripture is often quoted by the words “It saith” or “He saith” or “God saith. Possibly the indefinite form (comp. <a href="/hebrews/4-4.htm" title="For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.">Hebrews 4:4</a>)—which is not found in St Paul—is only here adopted because God is Himself addressed in the Psalm. (See Schöttgen, <span class="ital">Nov.

The “what” expresses a double feeling—how mean in himself! how great in <span class="ital">Thy</span> love! The Psalm is only Messianic in so far as it implies man’s final exaltation through Christ’s incarnation. It applies, in the first instance, and directly, to man; and only in a secondary sense to Jesus as man. But St Paul had already (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>) applied it in a Messianic sense, and “Son of man” was a Messianic title (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>). Thus the Cabbalists regarded the name Adam as an anagram for Adam, David, Moses, and regarded the Messiah as combining the dignity of all three. David twice makes the exclamation—“What is man?”;—once when he is thinking of man’s frailty in connection with his exaltation by God (Psalms 8); and once (<a href="/psalms/144-3.htm" title="LORD, what is man, that you take knowledge of him! or the son of man, that you make account of him!">Psalm 144:3</a>) when he is thinking only of man’s emptiness and worthlessness, as being undeserving of God’s care, (comp. <a href="/job/7-17.htm" title="What is man, that you should magnify him? and that you should set your heart on him?">Job 7:17</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?">Hebrews 2:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διεμαρτύρατο δέ που τὶς</span>, <span class="ital">but one in a certain place testified</span>) <span class="ital">one</span>, viz. <span class="ital">a witness</span>.

There are mentioned in that clause <span class="ital">the works of</span> GOD’S <span class="ital">hands, i.e.</span> heaven, the moon and stars.

The phrase does not imply uncertainty as to the passage cited. It is one used by Philo when exact reference is not necessary. It is equivalent to "but we do find the following testimony with regard to <span class="accented">man</span>." We say <span class="accented">to man</span>; for the eighth psalm, from which the citation comes, evidently refers to man generally; not primarily or distinctively to the Messiah. Nor does it appear to have been ranked by the Jews among the Messianic psalms. It would be arbitrary interpretation to assign to it (as some have done) an original meaning of which it contains no signs. This being the case, how are we to explain its application to Christ, which is not confined to this passage, but is found also in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>? There is no real difficulty. True, the psalm speaks of man only; but it is of man regarded according to the ideal position assigned to him in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, as God's vicegerent. Man as he now is (says the writer of this Epistle) does not fulfill this ideal; but Christ, the Son of man, and the Exalter of humanity, does. Therefore in him we find the complete fulfillment of the meaning of the psalm. If it be still objected that the application (in which sovereignty over all created things is inferred) transcends the meaning of the psalm, which refers to this earth only - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 6. of the psalm being taken in a wider sense than seems justified by the following verses, which confine the application to earthly creatures, it may be replied <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the idea of the psalmist is to be gathered, not only from <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, which he quotes, but, further, from the whole purport of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, of which the psalm is a lyrical expression, including the conception of man having been made in God's image, and invested with a sovereignty little short of Divine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, if the application does transcend the scope of the psalm, it was open to an inspired writer of the New Testament thus to extend its meaning, as seen in the new light from Christ. Taking the latter view, we have but to put the argument thus, in order to see its force and legitimacy: In <a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>. (read in connection with <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, on which it is founded) a position is assigned to man which at present he does not realize; but its whole idea is fulfilled, <span class="accented">and more than fulfilled</span>, in Christ. It is to be observed that the original reference of the psalm to man generally is not only evident in itself, but also essential to the writer's argument. For he is now passing from the view set forth in <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>, of what the SON is in himself, to the further view of his participation in humanity, in order to exalt humanity to the position forfeited through sin; and thus (as has been shown in the foregoing summary) to lead up to the idea of his being our <span class="accented">great High Priest. <span class="cmt_word"></span>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span> In the psalm this exclamation comes after a contemplation of the starry heavens, which had impressed the psalmist's mind with a sense of God's transcendent glory. In contrast with this glory, man's insignificance and unworthiness occur to him, as they have similarly occurred to many; but, at the same time, he thought of the high position assigned to man in the account of the creation, on which position he next enlarges. He asks how it can be that man, being what he is now, can be of such high estate. Thus the Epistle carries out truly the idea of the psalm, which is that man's appointed position in the scale of things is beyond what he seems now to realize. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In a certain place (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;)<p>Only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/4-4.htm">Hebrews 4:4</a>, signifying indefinite quotation.

Similarly the Latin visere means both to look at and to visit.

The lxx translators interpreted it, apparently, of time, "for some little time." Although there is precedent for both meanings in both Class. and N.T., the idea of time better suits the whole line of thought, and would probably, as Robertson Smith observes, have appeared to a Greek reader the more natural interpretation. For this sense see <a href="/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>; <a href="/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a>. He who has been described as superior to the angels, was, for a short time, on the same plane with man, and identified with an economy which was under the administration of angels. This temporary subordination to angels was followed by permanent elevation over them. &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;' &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;. The Hebrew is &#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;, than God.

The lxx translators understand it, not as representing the personal God, but that which is divine, in which sense it would be appropriate to angels as having divine qualities. </body></html>
