<a href="/galatians/4-5.htm" title="To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.">Galatians 4:5</a>.) Here, however, are placed in contrast the command and threatening which came through angels and the salvation “spoken through the Lord”; while the one “word” is thus wholly unlike the other in substance and in form of proclamation, each is a <span class= "ital">law, </span>in that neglect is visited with penalty. On the intrinsic greatness of the salvation the writer does not dwell; it is implied in the unique dignity and commission of Him through whom it was given.<p><span class= "bld">Which at the first began to be spoken.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was made sure unto us by them that heard.</span> “Through the Lord” (comp. <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>) was spoken this word of God which brought salvation. In two other passages Jesus receives the name “our Lord” (<a href="/hebrews/7-14.htm" title="For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.">Hebrews 7:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>), but nowhere else in this Epistle (unless perhaps in <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm" title="Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:">Hebrews 12:14</a>) is He spoken of as “the Lord”; the dignity of the title here heightens the contrast. “By them that heard “the word from Him, the writer says, it “was made sure” (not <span class= "ital">confirmed, </span>as if <span class= "ital">stronger</span> attestation were the meaning intended) “unto us.” It is evident that the writer here classes himself with those who had not immediately heard the word from Jesus. Such language as this stands in striking contrast with St. Paul’s claim, repeatedly maintained, to have received his doctrine directly from the Lord Himself (<a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Christ being proved to be superior to the angels, this doctrine is applied. Our minds and memories are like a leaky vessel, they do not, without much care, retain what is poured into them. This proceeds from the corruption of our nature, temptations, worldly cares, and pleasures. Sinning against the gospel is neglect of this great salvation; it is a contempt of the saving grace of God in Christ, making light of it, not caring for it, not regarding either the worth of gospel grace, or the want of it, and our undone state without it. The Lord's judgments under the gospel dispensation are chiefly spiritual, but are on that account the more to be dreaded. Here is an appeal to the consciences of sinners. Even partial neglects will not escape rebukes; they often bring darkness on the souls they do not finally ruin. The setting forth the gospel was continued and confirmed by those who heard Christ, by the evangelists and apostles, who were witnesses of what Jesus Christ began both to do and to teach; and by the gifts of the Holy Ghost, qualified for the work to which they were called. And all this according to God's own will. It was the will of God that we should have sure ground for our faith, and a strong foundation for our hope in receiving the gospel. Let us mind this one thing needful, and attend to the Holy Scriptures, written by those who heard the words of our gracious Lord, and were inspired by his Spirit; then we shall be blessed with the good part that cannot be taken away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How shall we escape - How shall we escape the just recompense due to transgressors? What way is there of being saved from punishment, if we suffer the great salvation to be neglected, and do not embrace its offers? The sense is, that there is no other way of salvation, and the neglect of this will be followed by certain destruction. why it will, the apostle proceeds to show, by stating that this plan of salvation was proclaimed first by the Lord himself, and had been confirmed by the most decided and amazing miracles.<p>If we neglect - It is not merely if we commit great sins. Not, if we are murderers, adulterers, thieves, infidels, atheists, scoffers. It is, if we merely "neglect" this salvation - if we do not embrace it - if we suffer it to pass unimproved. "Neglect" is enough to ruin a man. A man who is in business need not commit forgery or robbery to ruin himself; he has only to "neglect" his business, and his ruin is certain. A man who is lying on a bed of sickness, need not cut his throat to destroy himself; he has only to "neglect" the means of restoration, and he will be ruined. A man floating in a skiff above Niagara, need not move an oar or make an effort to destroy himself; he has only to "neglect" using the oar at the proper time, and he will certainly be carried over the cataract. Most of the calamities of life are caused by simple "neglect." By neglect of education children grow up in ignorance; by neglect a farm grows up to weeds and briars; by neglect a house goes to decay; by neglect of sowing, a man will have no harvest; by neglect of reaping, the harvest would rot in the fields. No worldly interest can prosper where there is neglect; and why may it not be so in religion? There is nothing in earthly affairs that is valuable that will not be ruined if it is not attended to - and why may it not be so with the concerns of the soul? Let no one infer, therefore, that because he is not a drunkard, or an adulterer, or a murderer, that, therefore, he will be saved. Such an inference would be as irrational as it would be for a man to infer that because he is not a murderer his farm will produce a harvest, or that because he is not an adulterer therefore his merchandise will take care of itself. Salvation would be worth nothing if it cost no effort - and there will be no salvation where no effort is put forth.<p>So great salvation - . Salvation from sin and from hell. It is called "great" because:<p>(1) Its author is great. This is perhaps the main idea in this passage. It "began to be spoken by the Lord;" it had for its author the Son of God, who is so much superior to the angels; whom the angels were required to worship <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>; who is expressly called God <a href="/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a>; who made all things, and who is eternal; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10-12</a>. A system of salvation promulgated by him "must" be of infinite importance, and have a claim to the attention of man.<p>(2) it is "great" because it saves from great sins. It is adapted to deliver from all sins, no matter how aggravated. No one is saved who feels that his sins are small, or that they are of no consequence. Each one sees his sins to be black and aggravated, and each one who enters heaven, will go there feeling and confessing that it is a great salvation which has brought such a sinner there. Besides, this salvation delivers from all sin - no matter how gross and aggravated. The adulterer, the murderer, the blasphemer, may come and be saved, and the salvation which redeems such sinners from eternal ruin is "great."<p>(3) it is great because it saves from great dangers. The danger of an eternal hell besets the path of each one. All do not see it; and all will not believe it when told of it. But this danger hovers over the path of every mortal. The danger of an eternal hell! Salvation from everlasting burnings! Deliverance from unending ruin! Surely that salvation must be great which shall save from such a doom! If that salvation is neglected, that danger still hangs over each and every man. The gospel did not create that danger - it came to deliver from it. Whether the gospel be true or false, each man is by nature exposed to eternal death - just as each one is exposed to temporal death whether the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and of the resurrection be true or false. The gospel comes to provide a remedy for dangers and woes - it does not create them; it comes to deliver people from great dangers - not to plunge them into them. "Back of the gospel," and before it was preached at all, people were in danger of everlasting punishment, and that system which came to proclaim deliverance from such a danger, is great.<p>(4) the salvation itself is great in heaven. It exalts people to infinite honors, and places on their heads an eternal crown. Heaven with all its glories is offered to us; and such a deliverance, and such an elevation to eternal honors, deserves to be called great. If that is neglected, there is no other salvation; and man must be inevitably destroyed.<p>(5) it is "great" because it was effected by infinite displays of power, and wisdom, and love. It was procured by the incarnation and humiliation of the Son of God. It was accomplished amidst great sufferings and self-denials. It was attended with great miracles. The tempest was stilled, and the deaf were made to hear, and the blind to see, and the dead were raised, and the sun was darkened, and the rocks were rent. The whole series of wonders connected with the incarnation and death of the Lord Jesus, was such as the world had not seen elsewhere, and such as was suited to hold the race in mute admiration and astonishment. If this be so, then religion is no trifle. It is not a matter of little importance whether we embrace it or not. It is the most momentous of all the concerns that pertain to man; and has a claim on his attention which nothing else can have. Yet the mass of people live in the "neglect" of it. It is not that they are professedly atheists, or deists, or that they are immoral or profane; it is not that they oppose it, and ridicule it, and despise it; it is that they simply "neglect" it. They pass it by. They attend to other things. They are busy with their pleasures, or in their counting-houses, in their workshops, or on their farms; they are engaged in politics, or in bookmaking, and they "neglect" religion now as a thing of small importance - proposing to attend to it hereafter, as if they acted on the principle that everything else was to be attended to before religion.<p>Which at the first - Greek "Which received the beginning of being spoken." The meaning is correctly expressed in our translation. Christ "began" to preach the gospel; the apostles followed him. John prepared the way; but the Saviour was properly the first preacher of the gospel.<p>By the Lord - By the Lord Jesus; see notes on <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>.<p>And was confirmed unto us ... - They who heard him preach, that is, the apostles, were witnesses of what he said, and certified us of its truth. When the apostle here says "us," he means the church at large. Christians were assured of the truth of what the Lord Jesus spake by the testimony of the apostles; or the apostles communicated it to those who had not heard him in such a manner as to leave no room for doubt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. we&#8212;who have received the message of salvation so clearly delivered to us (compare Heb 12:25).<p>so great salvation&#8212;embodied in Jesus, whose very name means "salvation," including not only deliverance from foes and from death, and the grant of temporal blessings (which the law promised to the obedient), but also grace of the Spirit, forgiveness of sins, and the promise of heaven, glory, and eternal life (Heb 2:10).<p>which&#8212;"inasmuch as it is a salvation which began," &c.<p>spoken by the Lord&#8212;as the instrument of proclaiming it. Not as the law, spoken by the instrumentality of angels (Heb 2:2). Both law and Gospel came from God; the difference here referred to lay in the instrumentality by which each respectively was promulgated (compare Heb 2:5). Angels recognize Him as "the Lord" (Mt 28:6; Lu 2:11).<p>confirmed unto us&#8212;not by penalties, as the law was confirmed, but by spiritual gifts (Heb 2:4).<p>by them that heard him&#8212;(Compare Lu 1:2). Though Paul had a special and independent revelation of Christ (Ga 1:16, 17, 19), yet he classes himself with those Jews whom he addresses, "unto us"; for like them in many particulars (for example, the agony in Gethsemane, Heb 5:7), he was dependent for autoptic information on the twelve apostles. So the discourses of Jesus, for example, the Sermon on the Mount, and the first proclamation of the Gospel kingdom by the Lord (Mt 4:17), he could only know by the report of the Twelve: so the saying, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Ac 20:35). Paul mentions what they had heard, rather than what they had seen, conformably with what he began with, Heb 1:1, 2, "spake &#8230; spoken." Appropriately also in his Epistles to Gentiles, he dwells on his independent call to the apostleship of the Gentiles; in his Epistle to the Hebrews, he appeals to the apostles who had been long with the Lord (compare Ac 1:21; 10:41): so in his sermon to the Jews in Antioch of Pisidia (Ac 13:31); and "he only appeals to the testimony of these apostles in a general way, in order that he may bring the Hebrews to the Lord alone" [Bengel], not to become partisans of particular apostles, as Peter, the apostle of the circumcision, and James, the bishop of Jerusalem. This verse implies that the Hebrews of the churches of Palestine and Syria (or those of them dispersed in Asia Minor [Bengel], 1Pe 1:1, or in Alexandria) were primarily addressed in this Epistle; for of none so well could it be said, the Gospel was confirmed to them by the immediate hearers of the Lord: the past tense, "was confirmed," implies some little time had elapsed since this testification by eye-witnesses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">How shall we escape?</span> This consequent answereth the antecedent in <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a></span>, but in one part of it, that which concerns the punishment of the transgressors of the law, thus: If the word by angels, much more the word by the Son; and if sins against that were punished, much more sins against this: the Spirit including the sanction of the gospel’s power in the judgment which it pronounceth upon its despisers, which it could not do if it were not established.

The righteous judgment of God, and eternal punishment: <p>if we neglect so great salvation? as the Gospel is, which is called salvation; in opposition to the law, which is the ministration of condemnation; and because it is a declaration of salvation by Christ; and is the means of bringing it near, and of the application of it in conversion, and so is the power of God unto it: and it is a "great" salvation; the Gospel which reveals it is great, for the author of it is Christ; it has been confirmed by miracles, and attended with great success; and has in it great things, great mysteries, and exceeding great and precious promises: and the salvation which it declares is great; it is the produce of great wisdom; it is wrought by a great person, by a Saviour, and a great one, and who is the great God, and our Saviour; it has been procured at great charge and expense, even at the expense of the blood and life of the Son of God; and has been obtained through great difficulties; and is the salvation of the soul, the more noble part of man; and it is a complete and everlasting one: to "neglect" this, is to be careless of it; to condemn it, and to despise the ministers of it; and to make anything else but Christ the way of salvation: and the danger such are in is very great; it is not possible that they should escape divine vengeance, since their sin is so great, and attended with such aggravating circumstances; for it is a contempt of the grace and wisdom of God in providing such a Saviour, and a trampling under foot the Son of God, and a counting his blood as a common thing; and besides, there is no more sacrifice for sin, they can have nothing to atone for it; and that God, whom they offend hereby, is both omniscient and omnipotent, and there will be no escaping out of his hands: to which must be added, that this Gospel of salvation is that <p>which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord; by the Lord Jesus Christ himself; the Gospel was preached by him, and he was extraordinarily qualified for it; and he spake it as never man did: it was preached by John indeed, and by all the prophets before him, and to the Israelites in the wilderness, and to Abraham before them, and even to Adam in Eden's garden, which was the first time it was spoken; but then it was spoken to him by the Lord; by the Word of the Lord, the essential Word, the Son of God, as the ancient Chaldee paraphrases, which express the sense of the old Jewish church, show (c): besides, it began most fully and clearly to be preached by him in the days of his flesh, so as it never was preached before, nor since; grace and truth, the doctrines of grace and truth came by him, in all their fulness and glory: and <p>was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; the Gospel is in itself firm and stable; nor did the words of Christ need any confirmation, who is truth itself, the "Amen", and faithful witness; but in condescension to human weakness, and by reason that Christ, as man, was not everywhere, and that by the mouth of more witnesses it should be established, he sent forth his apostles to preach it; who heard it from him, and they published it to the Jews first, as these were to whom the apostle writes, and then to the Gentiles.

And how unskilfully would the author have proceeded in the choice and position of his words, if—as Ebrard supposes—he had wished to express the thought, “that the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> was directly revealed by the Lord, has been transmitted to us as a certainty, and thus as a divine legitimation of the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> by the <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span>, the ear- (and eye-) witnesses!” <span class="greekheb">Ἀρχὴν λαβεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to begin</span>, always presupposes an opposition, expressed or understood, to a being continued, or to a being brought to an end. When thus in our passage there is mention made not only of an <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴν λαβεῖν λαλεῖσθαι</span> by the Lord, but also of a <span class="greekheb">βεβαιωθῆναι εἰς ἡμᾶς</span> on the part of those who heard the Lord, it is clear that the author will have these two factors regarded as statements of two distinct but mutually corresponding periods of time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In general, it is wrong when Ebrard, in connection with his explanation just adduced, will find in <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a> the twofold contrast with the law—(1) That the law was a mere word (<span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>); the gospel, on the other hand, a deliverance, a redemption, an act. (2) That the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> was manifested and proclaimed to men as at first hand, by the Lord Himself; the law, on the contrary, only at second hand, by the angels. For, as concerns the first alleged point of difference, assuredly the emphasis rests neither upon <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>, nor upon <span class="greekheb">σωτηρίας</span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a>; but, <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>, upon <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀγγέλων</span>, and, <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a>, upon <span class="greekheb">τηλικαύτης</span>. The second alleged point of difference falls, however, with the consideration that the author employs the preposition <span class="greekheb">διά</span>, as before <span class="greekheb">ἀγγέλων</span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>, so also before <span class="greekheb">τοῦ κυρίου</span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a>; thus indicates that the supreme Author alike of the Mosaic law and of the gospel is God Himself, both consequently are proclaimed to man “only at second hand.”[42] The pre-eminence of the gospel can accordingly have been discovered by our author only in the fact that in connection with this the Lord Himself was the intervening agent; in connection with the law, on the other hand, only the angels, who, according to chap. 1., are subordinate to the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τῶν ἀκουσάντων</span>] <span class="ital">by them that heard it</span> (<span class="ital">sc</span>. from the Lord; <span class="greekheb">παρὰ τοῦ κυρίου</span>, Chrysost.), thus by His apostles and immediate disciples. From these <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΣΑΝΤΕς</span></span></span> the author distinguishes himself and his readers (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ἩΜᾶς</span></span></span>). As well he himself as the Palestinian Christians to whom he writes must consequently have already belonged to a second generation of Christendom, and the author of the epistle cannot have been Paul (comp. <span class="ital">Introd</span>. p. 11). When Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. p. 378, 2 Aufl.) objects to this: “from <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμᾶς</span> is in truth evident only that the author belonged not to the number of those who could testify that they had with their own ears heard the Lord, at the time when He was upon earth proclaiming that salvation which they now preached,” this is indeed perfectly correct. But when he adds that Paul likewise had certainly only heard the word of salvation from the mouth of those who had listened to Jesus, this is—so long as the solemn asseveration of Paul himself (comp. expressly <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>) has any value for us—decidedly false. For Paul reckons himself not among the disciples of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΣΑΝΤΕς</span></span></span>, but among the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΣΑΝΤΕς</span></span></span> themselves. For the circumstance that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΕΙΝ</span></span></span> was otherwise brought about in his case than in the case of the original apostles, inasmuch as these had stood in the relation of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΣΑΝΤΕς</span></span></span> to the Christ walking upon earth, Paul, on the other hand, stood in the relation of an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΣΑς</span></span></span> to the exalted or heavenly Christ, left the essence of the matter itself untouched. Nor even by the assumption of a so-called <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΚΟΊΝΩΣΙς</span></span></span>, to which recourse has very frequently been had, can the conclusion resulting with stringent necessity from the words of our verse be set aside; for that which the writer of a letter says to his readers by means of an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΚΟΊΝΩΣΙς</span></span></span> is always of such nature as to be likewise true of himself; never can it stand in excluding opposition to himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΒΕΒΑΙΏΘΗ</span></span></span>] corresponds to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΈΝΕΤΟ ΒΈΒΑΙΟς</span></span></span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>; and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ἩΜᾶς ἘΒΕΒΑΙΏΘΗ</span></span></span> is a well-known blending of the notion of rest with that of the preceding movement.

T., on which Delitzsch insists, p. 49, 51, is regarded in general <span class="ital">unbiblical</span>; it is, moreover, remote from the thought of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, as the whole chapter in itself shows; only by forcing upon him dogmatic notions already <span class="ital">a priori</span> determined, and entirely disregarding the laws of grammar, can it be brought out from his statements.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm" title="How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;">Hebrews 2:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">πῶς ἡμεῖς</span>.… “How shall we”—to whom God has spoken through the Son, <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>—“escape (<span class="greekheb">ἔνδικον μισθ</span>. prob. in final judgment, as in <a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm" title="But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.">Hebrews 10:27</a>) if we have neglected (the aorist <span class="greekheb">ἀμελήσαντες</span> suggesting that life is looked at as a whole) so great a salvation?”—the salvation which formed the main theme of the new revelation. The meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἀμελήσαντες</span> is best illustrated by <a href="/matthew/22-5.htm" title="But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:">Matthew 22:5</a>, where it is used of those who disregarded, or treated with contempt, the invitation to the marriage-supper. The guilt and danger of so doing are in proportion to the greatness of the announcement, and this is no longer of law but of life, <span class="ital">cf.</span> 2 Corinthians 3. The word now spoken is vastly more glorious and more fully expressive of its Author than the Law, “Non erat <span class="ital">tanta</span> salus in V.T., quanta est in gratia quam Dei filius nobis attulit” (Atto Vercell:). The “greatness” of the salvation is involved in the greatness of Him who mediates it (<a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4</a>), of the method employed (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>), of the results, <span class="ital">many</span> sons being brought to <span class="ital">glory</span> (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>). But one relevant aspect of its greatness, the source and guaranteed truth of its proclamation is introduced by <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span>, which here retains its proper qualitative sense and may be rendered “inasmuch as it …”. “Its object is to introduce the mention of a characteristic quality, which explains or emphasises the thing in question” (Vaughan). It was the trustworthiness of the new revelation of salvation which the Hebrews were beginning to question. The law had proved its validity by punishing transgressors but the majesty and certainty of the recent proclamation were doubtful. Therefore the writer insists that it is “very great,” and illustrates its trustworthiness by adducing these three feattures: (1) its original proclamation by the Lord, (2) its confirmation by those who heard Him, (3) its miraculous certification by God. [This is not contradicted by Bleek’s “Das <span class="greekheb">τηλικ</span>., tantae talisque salutis, verweist an sich wohl nicht auf den nachfolgenden relativen Satz,” nor by Weiss’ “Das <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> hängt weder sprachlich noch sachlich mit <span class="greekheb">τηλικ</span>. zusammen.”] <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα λαλεῖσθαι</span>, lit.: “having received a beginning to be spoken” = “having begun to be spoken,” or “which was first proclaimed”. <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴν λαβ</span>., a common phrase in later Greek, see Stephanus and Wetstein. In Polybius of a war “taking its rise”. In Ælian, <span class="ital">V. H.</span>, ii. 28. <span class="greekheb">πόθεν τὴν ἀρχὴν ἔλαβεν ὅδε ὁ νόμος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐρῶ</span>. It is used here to indicate with precision the origin of the proclamation of the revelation about which they are feeling uncertain. <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖσθαι</span> refers back to <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a> and also to <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span> to be connected with <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴν λαβ</span>.; it is used instead of <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ</span> because God is throughout viewed as the ultimate source of revelation. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Κυρίου</span>, “the Lord” supreme over angels, and whose present exaltation reflects dignity and trustworthiness on the revelation He made while on earth. The salvation which they are tempted to neglect was at first proclaimed not by angels sent out to minister, not by servants or delegates who might possibly misapprehend the message, but by the Lord Himself, the Supreme. The source then is unquestionably pure. Has the stream been contaminated? God testifies to its purity. There is only one link between the Lord and you, they that heard Him delivered the message to you, and God by witnessing with them certifies its truth. The main verb is <span class="greekheb">ἐβεβαιώθη</span> which looks back to <span class="greekheb">βέβαιος</span> of <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>, and compares the inviolability of the one word or revelation with that of the other. We must not, he argues, neglect a gospel of whose veracity and importance we have assurance in this, that it was first proclaimed by the Lord Himself and that we have it on the authority of those who themselves heard Him, and who therefore were first-hand witnesses who had also made experimental verification of its validity. For <span class="greekheb">ἀκουσάντων</span> though without an object expressed, plainly means those who heard the Lord, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/1-1.htm" title="For as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,">Luke 1:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμᾶς</span> is rendered by Theophylact <span class="greekheb">διεπορθμεύθη εἰς ἡμᾶς βεβαίως</span>, it has been conveyed to us in a trustworthy manner. To their testimony was added the all-convincing witness borne by God, <span class="greekheb">συνεπιμαρτυροῦντος τοῦ θεοῦ</span>. The word is found in Aristotle, Philo and Polybius, xxvi. 9, 4, <span class="greekheb">παρόντων δὲ τῶν Θεττάλων καὶ συνεπιμαρτυρούντων τοῖς Δαρδανίοις</span>. Also in Clement, <span class="ital">Ep.</span>, c. xxiii., <span class="greekheb">συνεπιμαρτυρούσης τῆς γραφῆς</span>; but only here in N.T., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm" title="By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein you stand.">1 Peter 5:12</a>; <a href="/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>; <a href="/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>; <a href="/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a>. The sense is found in <a href="/mark/16-20.htm" title="And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.">Mark 16:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκήρυξαν πανταχοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Κυρίου συνεργοῦντος καὶ τὸν λόγον βεβαιοῦντος διὰ τῶν ἐπακολουθούντων σημείων</span>. This witness was borne <span class="greekheb">σημείοις τε καὶ τέρασιν</span> “by signs and wonders,” the two words referring to the same manifestations (<span class="greekheb">τε καὶ</span> closely uniting the words), which in one aspect were “signs” suggesting a Divine presence or a spirtual truth, and in another aspect “wonders” calculated to arrest attention. [The words are similarly conjoined in Polybius, Plutarch, Ælian, Philo and Josephus.] <span class="greekheb">καὶ ποικίλαις δυνάμεσιν</span> “and various miracles,” lit. powers, as in <a href="/matthew/11-21.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.">Matthew 11:21</a>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν ἐκεῖ δυνάμεις πολλάς</span>. Bleek thinks it is not the outward manifestations but the powers themselves that are here meant. This, he thinks, is suggested by the connexion of the word with <span class="greekheb">πνεύματος ἁγίου μερισμοῖς</span>, “distributions of the Holy Spirit”. The genitive is genitive objective, “distributions consisting of the Holy Spirit”. The remarkable character of the Charismata and the testimony they bore to a Divine presence and power are frequently alluded to in the N.T. and are enlarged upon in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="For the body is not one member, but many.">1 Corinthians 12:14</a>.
