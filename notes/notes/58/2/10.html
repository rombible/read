If the means at which men wondered were chosen by God, no one may doubt their supreme fitness for the end. In what this fitness consisted the following words partially explain.<p><span class= "bld">In bringing</span>.—It is doubtful whether the Greek word should not be rendered, <span class= "ital">having brought.</span> With this translation we must certainly explain the words on the same principle as the past tenses of <a href="/context/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7-8</a>. As in the divine counsels all things <span class= "ital">were</span> subjected to man, with the same propriety it may be said that God <span class= "ital">had</span> brought many sons to glory when the Saviour suffered and died.<p><span class= "bld">Many sons.</span>—The new thought here introduced is of great importance in the argument. The divine purpose is to bring many sons (comp. <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>) unto glory—the glory already spoken of as reserved for man—through His Son, who has Himself received this glory that He may make it theirs.<p><span class= "bld">Captain.</span>—This word occurs in three other places. In <a href="/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a> it bears its original meaning, “Leader<span class= "ital">”</span> (“a Leader and a Saviour”); in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a> and <a href="/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a> the idea of “leading the way” has passed into that of origination. In the present case, also, <span class= "ital">Author</span> is the best rendering; but in a context which so distinctly presents our Lord as taking on Himself the conditions of man’s lot, and so passing into the glory which He wins for man, the primary thought of <span class= "ital">leading</span> must not be entirely set aside. It is as the Author of salvation that He is made perfect through sufferings. Three aspects of this truth are presented in the Epistle. By His suffering unto death He “bare the sins of many” (<a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>); He offered the sacrifice of a perfect obedience (<a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>); He was enabled to be a perfect representative of man. This last thought pervades the remaining verses of the chapter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/hebrews/2.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Hebrews<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">CHRIST’S PERFECTING BY SUFFERING</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>IT does not ‘become’ us to be hasty or confident in determining what ‘becomes’ God. We had need to know the divine nature more perfectly, and the bearings of His actions more comprehensively and clearly than we do, before it can be safe to reject anything on the ground that it is unworthy of the divine nature. Perhaps we have not quite got to the bottom of the bottomless; perhaps men’s conceptions do not precisely constitute the standard to which God is bound to conform. It is unsafe to pronounce that a given thing is unworthy of Him. It is much safer to pronounce that a given thing is worthy of Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And that is what the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews does here, venturing upon ground on which the New Testament seldom enters, viz., the vindication of the doctrine of a suffering Christ, on the ground of its being congruous with the divine nature that He should suffer. Especially would such a thought be appropriate and telling to the audience to whom it was originally addressed. ‘We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block,’ says Paul And that doctrine of a suffering Messiah was the thing that stood in the way of the Jewish reception of the gospel, more perhaps than anything besides. So here we have the writer turning the tables upon the people, who might oppose it, on the ground of that discord and incongruity, and asserting that the whole of the sufferings of Jesus Christ do entirely harmonise with, are worthy of, and ‘become’ the supreme and absolute sovereignty of the God ‘for whom are all things, and by whom are all things.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are three points, then, to which I desire to turn. There is first, the great sweep of the divine purpose. There is, secondly, the apparently paradoxical method of effecting it; and there is, finally, the assertion of the entire congruity between that method and the divine nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. First of all, then, regard for a few moments the great sweep of the divine action in the gift of Christ as it is set forth here.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is bringing many sons unto glory, wherein there lies, of course, a metaphor of a great filial procession, being led on through all changes of this lower life, steadily upwards into the possession of what is here called ‘glory.’ The same metaphor colours the other expression of our text, ‘the Captain of our salvation.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the word translated ‘Captain, which only occurs some four times in Scripture, literally means one who leads, or begins any course or thing; and hence comes to mean a commander, or a prince, as it is twice translated; and then again, with a very easy transition from the notion of leading to that of origination, it comes to mean ‘cause’ or ‘author,’ as it is once translated. The conception of ‘author’ is the dominant one here, but it is also coloured by the prolongation of the metaphor in the previous clause. This great procession of sons up into glory, which is the object and aim of God’s work, is all under the leadership of Him who is the Captain, the foremost, the Originator, and, in a profound sense, the Cause, of their salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, then, we have before us the thought that God brings, and yet Christ leads, and God’s bringing is effected through Christ’s leadership. Then we have other thoughts, upon which time will not allow me to dwell. Let me just indicate them to you for your own expansion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Look at the extent of the divine act. ‘Many’ is used not in contrast to ‘all,’ as if there was proclaimed here a restricted application of Christ’s work in the divine idea; but ‘many’ is in opposition to ‘few,’ or, perhaps, in opposition to the One. There is One Leader, and there is an indefinite number of followers. The Connotation of the word ‘ many’ is the idea of uncounted number. This great procession, with its long and interminable files, sweeps onward under the guidance of the one Captain. So wide as to be universal is the sweep of God’s purpose to bring the ‘many,’ a ‘multitude that no man can number,’ into the possession of His glory. Then, note, the relationship which the members of that great company possess. The many are being brought as ‘sons’ under the leadership of the one Son. That opens out into the broad thought that the loftiest conception of God’s end in redemption is the making the ‘many’ like the One, and the investing of them all with every privilege and dignity which belongs to their Leader.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then note, further, the end of the march. This great company stretching numberless away beyond the range of vision, and all exalted into the dignity of sons, is steadfastly pressing onwards to the aim of fulfilling that divine ideal of humanity, long since spoken in the psalm, which in its exuberant promises sounds liker irony than hope. ‘Thou crownest Him with glory and honour.’ They are not only steadily marching onwards to the realisation of that divine ideal, but also to the participation of the glory of the Captain who is the ‘brightness of the Father’s glory;’ as well as ‘the express image of His person.’ So again, the underlying thought is the identity, as in fate here, so in destiny hereafter, of the army with its Leader. He is the Son, and the divine purpose is to make the ‘many’ partakers of His Sonship. He is the realisation of the divine ideal We see not yet all things put under man, but we see Jesus, and so we know that the ancient hope is not the baseless fabric of a vision, nor a dream which will pass when we awake to the realities, but is to be fulfilled in every one, down to the humblest private in that great army, all of whom shall partake in their measure and degree in the glory of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This, then, being the purpose, - the leading up out of the world into the glory, of a great company of sons who are conformed to the image of the Son - we attain the point from which we may judge of the adaptation of the means to the end. We cannot tell whether a thing is congruous with the nature of the doer of it till we know what the doer intended by the act. Inadequate conceptions of God’s purpose in Christ’s mission are sure to lead, as they always have led, to inadequate conceptions of the means to be adopted, and doubts of their congruity with the divine nature. If Christ’s mission is only meant to reveal to us a little more clearly truth concerning God and man, if He is only meant to stand before us as the ideal of conduct, and the pattern for our imitation, then there is no need for a Cross, which adds nothing to these; but if He has come to redeem, if He has come to turn slaves into sons, if He has come to lift men up from the mud and earthliness of their low and sensuous careers, and to set them upon the path that will lead them to share in the glory of God, then there is something more needed than would be adequate for the work of a Teacher howsoever wise, or than would be required for the work of an Example however beautiful and fair. The Cross is surplusage if Christ be a prophet only; it is surplusage and an incongruity if Christ be simply the foremost of the pure natures that have walked the earth, and shown the beauty of goodness. But if Christ has come to make men sons of God, by participation of His sonship, and to blanch and irradiate their blackness by the reflection and impartation of His own flashing glory, then it ‘became Him, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. That leads me to the next point that is here, viz., the paradox of the method adopted to carry out this divine purpose.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of course, I do not need to explain, I suppose, that the ‘perfecting through sufferings,’ which is here declared to take effect upon our Lord, does not mean the addition of anything to, or the purging away of anything from, His moral nature. You and I are refined by suffering; which purges out our dross, if we take it rightly. You and I are ennobled by suffering, which adds to us, if we rightly accept it, that which without it we could never possess. But Christ’s perfecting is not the perfecting of His moral character, but the completion of His equipment for His work of being the Captain of our salvation. That is to say, He Himself, though He learned obedience by the things that He suffered, was morally perfect, ere yet one shadow of pain or conflict had passed across the calm depths of His pure spirit. But He was not ready for His function of Leader and Originator of our salvation until He had passed through the sufferings of life and the agonies of death. Thus the whole sweep of Christ’s sufferings, both those which preceded the Cross, and especially the Cross itself, are included in the general expression of my text; and these equipped Him for His work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So we learn this lesson, the Captain who comes to make the soldiers like Himself can only accomplish His purpose by becoming like the soldiers. The necessity for our Lord’s sufferings is mainly based in the text here upon the simple principle that He who is to deliver men must be a Man. The leader must have no exemption from the hardships of the company. If He is to be a leader, He and we must go by the same road. He must tramp along all the weary path that we have to tread. He must experience all the conflicts and difficulties that we have to experience. He cannot lift us up into a share of His glory unless He stoops to the companionship of our grief. No man upon a higher level can raise one on a lower, except on condition of Himself going down, with His hand at any rate, to the level from which He would lift. And no Christ will be able to accomplish the Father’s design, except a Christ that knows the fellowship of our sufferings, and is made conformable unto our death. Therefore because ‘He took not hold to help angels, but the seed of Abraham, it behooved Him to be made in all things like unto His brethren.’ And when the soldiers are weary on the march, footsore and tired, they bethink themselves<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">‘Headquarters were here yesterday.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘We can go through no darker rooms<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Than He went through before.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And where He has stretched Himself on the cold ground and bivouacked, we need not be ashamed or afraid to lie down. The Captain of our salvation has gone through and shared all our hardships, and plodded with bleeding feet over every inch of the ground over which He would lead us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, we learn the necessity of His suffering in order to His sympathy. Before He suffers, He has the pity of a God; after He suffers He has learnt the compassion of a man. And though in the fight the general seems to have gone up the hill, and left the army to struggle in the plain, He has gone like Moses to the mount to lift all-powerful bands of intercession, and bearing in His heart tender compassion, a fellow-feeling of our pains. No Christ is worth anything to me, suffering and bleeding and agonizing here, unless He be a Christ of whom I know that His heart is full of sympathy because Himself has felt the same, and that He has learnt to run to the help of the miserable, because He Himself is not ignorant of misfortune.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then we learn, further, the necessity of the Captain’s suffering in order to emancipate us from the dominion of the evil that He bears. No doctrine of identification with our common infirmities, or sympathy in regard of our daily trials is adequate to explain, or to reach to the depths of this paradox of a crucified Commander. We need another thought than that, and it lies in this. ‘He Himself bare our sins in His own body on the tree.’ The necessity for knowing all our condition and sharing it was not the only necessity that brought Christ to suffer and to die. But upon Him was gathered the whole mass and Blackness of human sin, and in His separation from the Father, and in the outward fact of death, He bare our miseries, and by His stripes we were healed. No Christ is enough for me a sinner except a Christ whose Cross takes away the Burden and the penalty of my transgression. And thus ‘it became Him to make the Captain of salvation perfect through suffering,’ else the design of making men His sons and sharers of His glory could never come to pass.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Therefore, lastly, mark the harmony between the loftiest conception of the divine character and nature and these sufferings of Jesus.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The writer dwells upon two aspects of God’s relation to the universe. ‘It became Him for whom are all things, and by or through whom are all things.’ That is to say, the sufferings and death of the Christ, in whom is God manifest in the flesh, are worthy of that lofty nature to the praise and glory of which all things contribute. The Cross is the highest manifestation of the divine nature. The paradox remains that a dying man should more worthily set forth the deep heart of God, and should therefore more completely realise the divine purpose that all things should be for His glory, than all besides can do. Creation witnesses of Him, providence witnesses of Him, these marvellous spirits of ours proclaim His praise, but the deep heart of God, like some rich fruit, if I may so say, is cleft open by the Cross, and all its treasures laid bare, as they are displayed nowhere besides. So the purpose - which may be so stated as to be only Almighty selfishness, but which is really the expression of Almighty love - the purpose of God that all creation should redound to His honour, and be ‘for Him,’ reaches its end through the suffering of Jesus Christ, and in Him, and in His death God is glorified. ‘It became Him, for whom are all things, to perfect through suffering the Captain of our salvation.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another aspect, closely connected with this, lies in that other clause. Christ’s sufferings and death are congruous with that Almighty power by which the Universe has sprung into being and is sustained. His creative agency is not the highest exhibition of His power. Creation is effected by a word. The bare utterance of the divine will was all that was needed to make the heavens and the earth, and ‘to preserve the stars from wrong.’ But the bare utterance of will is not enough here. If men are to be brought to glory, they cannot be brought by the mere desire of God to bring them, or by the mere utterance of His will that they should be brought. This work needs a process, needs that something should be done. This work needs the humiliation, the suffering, the death, resurrection, ascension, and session at the right hand of God, of the Captain of our salvation and the Prince of our life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So though by Him are all things, if we would know the full sweep and Omnipotence of His power, He points us away from creation, and its ineffectual fires that pale before this brighter Light in which His whole self is embodied, and says, ‘There, that is the arm of the Lord made bare in the sight of all the nations.’ Omnipotence has made the world, the Cross has redeemed it. From that Cross there come the loftiest conceptions of Him for whom all things are, but for whom men are not, unless the Cross has won them; by whom are all things, but by whom men are, through more wondrous exercise of divine power, when they are redeemed by the precious blood, than when they were made by the creative fiat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Therefore, brethren, listen to God saying, ‘I have set Him for a witness to the people, for a Leader and a Commander to the people,’ and see to it that you enlist in this Captain’s army, and follow His banners and trust in His Cross, that your sufferings may be His, and the merit of His may be yours, and that in His sonship you may be sons, and the flashings of His glory may change your earthliness from glory to glory, into the image of the Son, made perfect through suffering and crowned with glory and honour, which He parts among all His soldiers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a></span>. In this verse the apostle expresses, in his own words, what he before expressed in those of the psalmist. <span class="ital">For it became him </span>— It was suitable to all his attributes, especially to his justice and mercy, his holiness and goodness, his wisdom and truth; <span class="ital">for whom </span>— As their ultimate end; <span class="ital">and by whom </span>— As their first cause; <span class="ital">are all things; in bringing many sons unto glory </span>— Namely, believers, called God’s sons, <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.">Romans 8:14</a>; and frequently elsewhere.

His way to the crown was by the cross, and so must that of his people be. Christ sanctifies; he has purchased and sent the sanctifying Spirit: the Spirit sanctifies as the Spirit of Christ. True believers are sanctified, endowed with holy principles and powers, set apart to high and holy uses and purposes. Christ and believers are all of one heavenly Father, who is God. They are brought into relation with Christ. But the words, his not being ashamed to call them brethren, express the high superiority of Christ to the human nature. This is shown from three texts of Scripture. See Ps 22:22; 18:2; Isa 8:18.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For it became him - There was a fitness or propriety in it; it was such an arrangement as became God to make, in redeeming many, that the great agent by whom it was accomplished, should be made complete in all respects by sufferings. The apostle evidently means by this to meet an objection that might be offered by a Jew to the doctrine which he had been stating - an objection drawn from the fact that Jesus was a man of sorrows, and that his life was a life of affliction. This he meets by stating that there was a "fitness" and "propriety" in that fact. There was a reason for it - a reason drawn from the plan and character of God. It was fit, in the nature of the case, that he should be qualified to be "a complete" or "perfect Saviour" - a Saviour just adapted to the purpose undertaken, by sufferings. The "reasons" of this fitness, the apostle does not state. The amount of it probably was, that it became him as a Being of infinite benevolence; as one who wished to provide a perfect system of redemption, to subject his Son to such sufferings as should completely qualify him to be a Saviour for all people. This subjection to his humble condition, and to his many woes, made him such a Saviour as man needed, and qualified him fully for his work. There was a propriety that he who should redeem the suffering and the lost should partake of their nature; identify himself with them; and share their woes, and the consequences of their sins.<p>For whom are all things - With respect to whose glory the whole universe was made; and with respect to whom the whole arrangement for salvation has been formed. The phrase is synonymous with "the Supreme Ruler;" and the idea is, that it became the Sovereign of the universe to provide a perfect scheme of salvation - even though it involved the humiliation and death of his own Son.<p>And by whom are all things - By whose agency everything is made. As it was by his agency, therefore, that the plan of salvation was entered into, there was a "fitness" that it should be perfect. It was not the work of fate or chance, and there was a propriety that the whole plan should bear the mark of the infinite wisdom of its Author.<p>In bringing many sons unto glory - To heaven. This was the plan - it was to bring many to heaven who should be regarded and treated as his sons. It was not a plan to save a few - but to save many. Hence, learn:<p>(1) that the plan was full of benevolence.<p>(2) no representation of the gospel should ever be made which will leave the impression that only a few, or a small part of the whole race, will be saved. There is no such representation in the Bible, and it should not be made. God intends, taking the whole race together, to save a large part of the human family. Few in ages that are past, it is true, may have been saved; few now are his friends and are traveling to heaven; but there are to be brighter days on earth. The period is to arrive when the gospel shall spread over all lands, and during that long period of the millennium, innumerable millions will be brought under its saving power, and be admitted to heaven. All exhibitions of the gospel are wrong which represent it as narrow in its design; narrow in its offer; and narrow in its result.<p>To make the captain of their salvation - The Lord Jesus, who is represented as the leader or commander of the army of the redeemed - "the sacramental host of God's elect." The word "captain" we apply now to an inferior officer - the commander of a "company" of soldiers. The Greek word - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  arche&#772;gos - is a more general term, and denotes, properly, the author or source of anything; then a leader, chief prince. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>, it is rendered "prince" - "and killed the prince of life." So in <a href="/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>. "Him hath God exalted to be a prince and a Saviour." In <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, it is rendered "author." "Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith;" compare the notes at that place.<p>Perfect through sufferings - Complete by means of sufferings; that is, to render him wholly qualified for his work, so that he should be a Saviour just adapted to redeem man. This does not mean that he was sinful before and was made holy by his sufferings; nor that he was not in all respects a perfect man before; but it means, that by his sufferings he was made "wholly suited" to be a Saviour of people; and that, therefore, the fact of his being a suffering man was no evidence, as a Jew might have urged, that he was not the Son of God. There was a "completeness," a "filling up," of all which was necessary to his character as a Saviour, by the sufferings which he endured. We are made morally "better" by afflictions, if we receive them in a right manner - for we are sinful, and need to be purified in the furnace of affliction; Christ was not made "better," for he was before perfectly holy, but he was completely endowed for the work which he came to do, by his sorrows. Nor does this mean here precisely that he was exalted to heaven as a "reward" for his sufferings, or that he was raised up to glory as a consequence of them - which was true in itself - but that he was rendered "complete" or "fully qualified" to be a Saviour by his sorrows. Thus, he was rendered complete:<p>(1) Because his suffering in all the forms that flesh is liable to, made him an example to all his people who shall pass through trials. They have before them a perfect model to show them how to bear afflictions. Had this not occurred, he could not have been regarded as a "complete" or "perfect" Saviour - that is, such a Saviour as we need.<p>(2) he is able to sympathize with them, and to succour them in their temptations, <a href="/hebrews/2-18.htm">Hebrews 2:18</a>.<p>(3) by his sufferings an atonement was made for sin. He would have been an "imperfect" Saviour - if the name "Saviour" could have been given to him at all - if he had not died to make an atonement for transgression. To render him "complete" as a Saviour, it was necessary that he should suffer and die; and when he hung on the cross in the agonies of death, he could appropriately say, "it is "finished." The work is complete. All has been done that could be required to be done; and man may now have the assurance that he has a perfect Saviour, perfect not only in moral character - but perfect in his work, and in his adaptedness to the condition of people;" compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8-9</a>.

For&#8212;giving a reason why "the grace of God" required that Jesus "should taste death."<p>it became him&#8212;The whole plan was (not only not derogatory to, but) highly becoming God, though unbelief considers it a disgrace [Bengel]. An answer to the Jews, and Hebrew Christians, whosoever, through impatience at the delay in the promised advent of Christ's glory, were in danger of apostasy, stumbling at Christ crucified. The Jerusalem Christians especially were liable to this danger. This scheme of redemption was altogether such a one as harmonizes with the love, justice, and wisdom of God.<p>for whom&#8212;God the Father (Ro 11:36; 1Co 8:6; Re 4:11). In Col 1:16 the same is said of Christ.<p>all things&#8212;Greek, "the universe of things," "the all things." He uses for "God," the periphrasis, "Him for whom &#8230; by whom are all things," to mark the becomingness of Christ's suffering as the way to His being "perfected" as "Captain of our salvation," seeing that His is the way that pleased Him whose will and whose glory are the end of all things, and by whose operation all things exist.<p>in bringing&#8212;The Greek is past, "having brought as He did," namely, in His electing purpose (compare "ye are sons," namely, in His purpose, Ga 4:6; Eph 1:4), a purpose which is accomplished in Jesus being "perfected through sufferings."<p>many&#8212;(Mt 20:28). "The Church" (Heb 2:12), "the general assembly" (Heb 12:23).<p>sons&#8212;no longer children as under the Old Testament law, but sons by adoption.<p>unto glory&#8212;to share Christ's "glory" (Heb 2:9; compare Heb 2:7; Joh 17:10, 22, 24; Ro 8:21). Sonship, holiness (Heb 2:11), and glory, are inseparably joined. "Suffering," "salvation," and "glory," in Paul's writings, often go together (2Ti 2:10). Salvation presupposes destruction, deliverance from which for us required Christ's "sufferings."<p>to make &#8230; perfect&#8212;"to consummate"; to bring to consummated glory through sufferings, as the appointed avenue to it. "He who suffers for another, not only benefits him, but becomes himself the brighter and more perfect" [Chrysostom]. Bringing to the end of troubles, and to the goal full of glory: a metaphor from the contests in the public games. Compare "It is finished," Lu 24:26; Joh 19:30. I prefer, with Calvin, understanding, "to make perfect as a completed sacrifice": legal and official, not moral, perfection is meant: "to consecrate" (so the same Greek is translated Heb 7:28; compare Margin) by the finished expiation of His death, as our perfect High Priest, and so our "Captain of salvation" (Lu 13:32). This agrees with Heb 2:11, "He that sanctifieth," that is, consecrates them by Himself being made a consecrated offering for them. So Heb 10:14, 29; Joh 17:19: by the perfecting of His consecration for them in His death, He perfects their consecration, and so throws open access to glory (Heb 10:19-21; Heb 5:9; 9:9 accord with this sense).<p>captain of, &c.&#8212;literally, Prince-leader: as Joshua, not Moses, led the people into the Holy Land, so will our Joshua, or Jesus, lead us into the heavenly inheritance (Ac 13:39). The same Greek is in Heb 12:2, "Author of our faith." Ac 3:15, "Prince of life" (Ac 5:31).

But what really decides against that view is—(1) That according to <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm" title="For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,">Hebrews 2:11</a> the believers are brethren of Christ, and sons of God; consequently <span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα</span> would be unsuitable as an utterance with respect to Christ, while the interpretation of the <span class="greekheb">υἱούς</span> as sons of <span class="ital">God</span>, adopted by Nickel, <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, in connection with the referring of the <span class="greekheb">ἀγαγόντα</span> to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, would be unnatural. (2) That, assuming the identity of the subject in <span class="greekheb">ἀγαγόντα</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγόν</span>, both expressions would in effect cover each other, consequently become tautological. We must accordingly take, as the subject in <span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα</span>, <span class="ital">God</span>; in <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">Christ</span>.

II. 1, p. 51 f.), Riehm (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 581), Alford, Maier, Moll, Kurtz, Woerner, and many others. It cannot, however, be urged against the referring of <span class="greekheb">ἀγαγόντα</span> to God (Carpzov, Michaelis, and others), that we have not, instead of the accusative <span class="greekheb">ἀγαγόντα</span>, the dative <span class="greekheb">ἀγαγόντι</span>, which no doubt would have been more accurate on account of the preceding <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>; since this very accusative is otherwise the general case of the subject grammatically construed with the accusative.

The Messianic glory and blessedness is intended thereby. The word <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, however, was chosen in accordance with the words: <span class="greekheb">δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον</span>, <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, taken over from the psalm cited.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀγαγόντα</span>] cannot signify: “since He would lead” (Bleek, Stengel, Bloomfield, and Bisping; after the precedent of Erasmus, <span class="ital">Annott.</span>; Piscator, Grotius, Owen, Seb. Schmidt, Limborch, Peirce, Starck, Wolf, Storr, Ernesti, Dindorf, Schulz, Böhme, Kuinoel, Klee). For the <span class="ital">aorist</span> has never a <span class="ital">future</span> sense. But neither is <span class="greekheb">ἀγαγόντα</span> to be rendered by “qui <span class="ital">adduxerat</span>,” with the Vulgate, Estius, Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 39, 1 Aufl.; <span class="ital">Komm.</span> p. 121; differently <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. 2 Aufl. p. 51), and others; in such wise that the thought were directed to the saints of the O. T., already led to glory. For the characterizing of Christ as the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγὸς τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν</span> shows that the <span class="greekheb">υἱοί</span>, in whom was accomplished the <span class="greekheb">εἶ δόξαν ἄγεσθαι</span> on the part of God, must already have been in communion with Christ,[47]—the communion with Christ was the conditioning cause of their attainment to the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. According to Tholuck, who is followed by Moll, the participle aorist indicates, “as the nearer defining of the infinitive aorist <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΛΕΙῶΣΑΙ</span></span></span>, the specific character of the same without respect to the relation of time.” But only the <span class="ital">infinitive</span>, not the <span class="ital">participle</span> aorist is used non-temporally; and the “specific character” of <span class="greekheb">τελειῶσαι</span> cannot be expressed by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΓΌΝΤΑ</span></span></span>, for the reason that the personal objects of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΓΌΝΤΑ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΛΕΙῶΣΑΙ</span></span></span> are different, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΑΓΌΝΤΑ</span></span></span> can have no other meaning than: <span class="ital">since He led</span>, and is the indication of the <span class="ital">cause</span> from the standpoint of the writer. The participle aorist has its justification in the fact that, from the moment Christ appeared on earth as a redeemer, and found faith among men, God in reality was leading <span class="greekheb">εἰς δόξαν</span> those who believed, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> caused them to walk in the way to the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. For only this notion of title to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">in reversion</span>, not that of the actual <span class="ital">possession</span> of the same, can be meant; inasmuch as the possession of the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> will only come in at the Parousia. The causal relation, however, of the participial clause: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΛΛΟῪς ΥἹΟῪς ΕἸς ΔΌΞΑΝ ἈΓΆΓΟΝΤΑ</span></span></span>, to the main statement: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΠΡΕΠΕ ΤῸΝ ἈΡΧΗΓῸΝ Τῆς ΣΩΤΗΡΊΑς ΑὐΤῶΝ ΔΙᾺ ΠΑΘΗΜΆΤΩΝ ΤΕΛΕΙῶΣΑΙ</span></span></span>, and consequently the justification of the latter by the former, lies in the fact that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΛΛΟῚ ΥἹΟΊ</span></span></span>, just because they were not angels but men, could only be redeemed in that Christ for them became man, and for them suffered and died; even as the author himself will more fully show, <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a> ff. Others find the causal relation by supplying, in thought, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΠΑΘΗΜΆΤΩΝ</span></span></span> to the first clause also. So Jac. Cappellus: “quum tot filios suos per afflictiones consecrasset, afflictionum via perduxisset ad gloriam pater coelestis, decebat sane et aequum erat, ut principem salutis eorum eadem via perduceret ad coelestem gloriam.” In like manner Grotius: “quia fieri non potest, ut qui se pietati dedunt, non multa mala patiantur … ideo Deus voluit ipsum auctorem salutiferae doctrinae non nisi per graves calamitates perducere ad statum ilum perfectae beatitudinis.” But in this case the express addition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΠΑΘΗΜΆΤΩΝ</span></span></span> in the first clause could not have been omitted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ἈΡΧΗΓΌΝ</span></span></span>] Comp. <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a>.

The humiliation of the Son justified; “a condensed and pregnant view of the theory of the whole work of Christ, which subsequent chapters develop, eludicate, and justify dialectically, in contrast or comparison with the O.T.… The ultimate source of all doubt whether the new dispensation is superior to the old is nothing else than want of clear insight into the work of Christ, and especially into the significance of His passion, which, to the Jews, from whom the Hebrew Christians of our Epistle were drawn, was the chief stumbling-block in Christianity. Here, therefore, the writer has at length got into the heart of his subject, and, leaving the contrast between Christ and the angels, urges the positive doctrine of the identification of Jesus with those that are his—his brethren, the Sons of God whom He sanctifies—as the best key to that connection between the passion and glorification of Christ which forms the cardinal point of N.T. revelation” (Robertson Smith). To this it may only be added that in order to prove man’s supremacy and justify Psalms 8, it was essential that the writer should show that Christ was man, identified with humanity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In justification then (justification introduced by <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>) of the subjection of Jesus to the <span class="greekheb">πάθημα θανάτου</span>, the writer proceeds to say <span class="greekheb">ἔπρεπεν αὐτῷ</span> “it befitted Him”. The expression, says Carpzov, is “frequentissima Philoni phrasis”; but in Scripture, at least in this sense, it stands alone: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/jeremiah/10-7.htm" title="Who would not fear you, O King of nations? for to you does it appertain: for as much as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like to you.">Jeremiah 10:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-1.htm" title="Praise waits for you, O God, in Sion: and to you shall the vow be performed.">Psalm 65:1</a>. Aristotle (<span class="ital">Nic. Eth.</span>, iv. 2–2: Burnet, p. 173) says that what is befitting is relative to the person, the circumstances and the object [<span class="greekheb">τὸ πρέπον δὴ πρὸς αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν ᾧ καὶ περὶ ὅ</span>]. The object here in view, the “bringing many sons to glory,” needs no justification. As Tertullian (<span class="ital">adv. Marcion</span>, ii. 27) says: “nihil tam dignum Deo, quam salus hominis”. But that the means used by God to accomplish this end was not only fit to bring it about but was also <span class="greekheb">πρέπον θεῷ</span>, in other words, that Christ’s humiliation and death were in accordance with the Divine nature, is the point the writer wishes to make good. “The whole course of nature and grace must find its explanation in God, and not merely in an abstract Divine <span class="ital">arbitrium</span>, but in that which befits the Divine nature”. This matter of Christ’s suffering has not been isolated in God’s government but is of a piece with all He is and has done; it has not been handed over to chance, accident, or malevolent powers, but is part of the Divine rule and providence; it is not exceptional, unaccountable, arbitrary, but has its root and origin in the very nature of God. God acted freely in the matter, governed only by His own nature. “Man has not wholly lost the intuitive power by which the fitness of the Divine action, its correspondence to the idea standard of right which his conscience certifies and his reason approves, may be recognised” (Henson, <span class="ital">Disc, and Law</span>, p. 56). “It is worth noting that the chief value of Anselm’s view of the Atonement lies in the introduction into theology of the idea of what befits God—the idea, as he puts it, of God’s honour. Anselm fails, however, by thinking rather of what God’s honour must receive as its due than of what it is seemly for God in His grace to do, and thus his theory becomes shallow and inadequate” (Robertson Smith). The writer does not say <span class="greekheb">ἔπρεπεν θεῷ</span> but <span class="greekheb">ἔπρεπεν αὐτῷ διʼ ὅν τὰ πάντα καὶ διʼ οὗ τὰ πάντα</span> “Him on account of whom are all things and through whom are all things,” who is the reason and the cause of all existence; in whom, therefore, everything must find its reason and justification. “Denn wenn um seinetwillen das All ist, also Alles seinen Zwecken dienen muss, und durch ihn das All ist, also nichts ohne sein Zuthun zu Stande kommt, so muss man bei Allem, was geschieht, und somit auch bei dem Todesleiden fragen, wiefern es ihm angemessen ist” (Weiss). The purpose of God is expressed in the words: <span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα</span> “in bringing many sons to glory”. The accusative <span class="greekheb">ἀγαγ</span>. (although referring to <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>) does not require us to construe it with <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγὸν</span>. That is a possible but clumsy construction. The use of <span class="greekheb">υἱοὺς</span> implies that the Father is the subject and leads us to expect that the action of God will be mentioned. And this construction, in which the dative of the subject becomes an accusative when an infinitive follows, is not unknown, but is merely a species of attraction—the infinitive drawing the noun into the case appropriate. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/acts/11-12.htm" title="And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:">Acts 11:12</a>; <a href="/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>; <a href="/luke/1-74.htm" title="That he would grant to us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,">Luke 1:74</a>. Examples from the classics in <span class="ital">Matthiae</span>, 535. The aorist participle has led the Vulgate to translate “qui multos filios in gloriam adduxerat,” needlessly, for “the aorist participle is sometimes used adverbially in reference to an action evidently in a general way coincident in time with the action of the verb, yet not identical with it. The choice of the aorist participle rather than the present in such cases is due to the fact that the action is thought of, not as in progress, but as a simple event or fact (Burton, <span class="ital">M. and T.</span>, 149). <span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς υἱοὺς</span> “many” is not used with any reference to the population of the world, or to the proportion of the saved, but to the one Son already celebrated. It was God’s purpose not only to have one Son in glory, but to bring many to be partakers with Him. Hence the difficulty; hence the need of the suffering of Christ. But it is not merely <span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς</span> but <span class="greekheb">πολλοὺς υἱοὺς</span> suggesting the relationship dwelt upon in the succeeding verses. <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σωτηρίας</span> … the author [pioneer] of their salvation indicating that feature of Christ’s relation to the saved which determined His experience, “the Captain of their salvation”. R.V. has “author” following Vulg. Chrysostom has <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγὸν τουτέστι τὸν αἴτιον</span>, and so Robertson Smith, “it is hardly necessary to put more meaning into the phrase than is contained in the parallel expression of <a href="/hebrews/5-9.htm" title="And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;">Hebrews 5:9</a>”. So Bleek, Kübel and von Soden. But the word is select, and why select, if not to bring out precisely this, that in the present case the cause is also the leader, “that the Son goes before the saved in the same path”. He is the strong swimmer who carries the rope ashore and so not only secures His own position but makes rescue for all who will follow. “The <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγός</span> himself first takes part in that which he establishes” (Westcott). One of the chief points in the Epistle is that the Saviour is also <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγός</span>. The word is commonly used of founders of tribes, rulers and commanders, persons who begin anything in become the source of anything, but or this Epistle (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>) it has over and above the sense of “pioneer”. <span class="greekheb">διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι</span>, “to perfect through sufferings”. <span class="greekheb">τελειῶσαι</span> is to make <span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span>, to bring a person or thing to the appropriate <span class="greekheb">τέλος</span>, to complete, perfect, consummate. In the Pentateuch it is regularly used to denote the consecration of the priests. In the N.T. this consecration is no formal setting apart to office, but a preparation involving ethical fitness. So that here the word <span class="ital">directly</span> denotes making perfect as leader of salvation, but <span class="ital">indirectly</span> and by implication making morally perfect. And this moral perfection, requisite in one who was to cleanse sinners (note <span class="greekheb">σωτηρίας</span>) and lead the way to glory, could only be proved and acquired through the sufferings involved in living as man, tempted and with death to face. Therefore <span class="greekheb">διὰ παθημάτων</span>, “a plurality of sufferings” not merely as in <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a> <span class="greekheb">τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/2-18.htm" title="For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.">Hebrews 2:18</a>. The glory indeed to which this captain of salvation leads is the glory of triumph over temptation and all that tends to terrify and enslave men.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">For it became him</span>] Unlike St Paul the writer never enters into what may be called “the philosophy of the plan of salvation.” He never attempts to throw any light upon the mysterious subject of the antecedent necessity for the death of Christ. Perhaps he considered that all which could be profitably said on that high mystery had already been said by St Paul (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). He dwells upon Christ’s death almost exclusively <span class="ital">in its relation to us</span>. The expression which he here uses “it was morally fitting for Him” is almost the only one which he devotes to what may be called the <span class="ital">transcendent</span> side of Christ’s sacrifice—the death of Christ as regards its relation to God. He develops no theory of vicarious satisfaction, &c., though he uses the metaphoric words “redemption” and “make reconciliation for” (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>). The “moral fitness” here touched upon is the necessity for absolutely sympathetic unity between the High Priest and those for whom he offered His perfect sacrifice. Compare <a href="/luke/24-46.htm" title="And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:">Luke 24:46</a>, “thus it behoved Christ to suffer.” Philo also uses the phrase “it became Him.” It is a very remarkable expression, for though it also occurs in the LXX. (<a href="/jeremiah/10-7.htm" title="Who would not fear you, O King of nations? for to you does it appertain: for as much as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like to you.">Jeremiah 10:7</a>), yet in this passage alone does it contemplate the actions of God under the aspect of inherent moral fitness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for whom</span>] i.e. “for whose sake,” “on whose account.” The reference here is to God, not to Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by whom</span>] i.e. by whose creative agency. Compare <a href="/romans/11-36.htm" title="For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.">Romans 11:36</a>, “of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things.” The same words may also be applied to Christ, but the context here shews that they refer to God the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in bringing</span>] Lit., “having brought.” The use of the <span class="ital">aorist</span> participle is difficult, but the “glory” seems to imply the potential triumph of man in the one <span class="ital">finished</span> act of Christ which was due to “the grace of God.” The “Him” and the “having brought” refer to God and not to Christ. God led many sons to glory through the Captain of their Salvation, whom—in that process of Redemptive Work which is shared by each “Person” of the Blessed Trinity—He perfected through suffering.

He has put the discussion concerning <span class="ital">Glory</span> in this very passage first, for the purpose of sharpening (giving the more point to) his exhortation, and meeting beforehand the scandal attached to His suffering and death. But he has interwoven a fuller consideration of both points with the following discussion respecting the Priesthood, which is brought forward at <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm" title="Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.">Hebrews 2:17</a>.

That he should attain through human suffering even unto death to his own perfected state of glory, as being the Leader of human sons whom the one Father of all would bring to glory, was a design worthy of him for whom and through whom are all things - suitable to what we conceive of him and of his way of working. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> is used in the same sense not infrequently in the LXX. It is probably used here with some view to "<span class="accented">the</span> offence of the cross," which might still linger in the minds of some of the Hebrew Christians. In the argument that follows, supported still by reference to Old Testament anticipations, the writer not only meets possible objections lingering in the Hebrew mind, but also carries on and completes the view of the SON which it is his purpose to inculcate, leading up (as aforesaid) to the final position of his being the High Priest of humanity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>It became (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Not logical necessity (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>), nor obligation growing out of circumstances (&#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, <a href="/hebrews/2-17.htm">Hebrews 2:17</a>), but an inner fitness in God's dealing. Dr. Robertson Smith observes: "The whole course of nature and grace must find its explanation in God; and not merely in an abstract divine arbitrium, but in that which befits the divine nature."<p>For whom - by whom (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;' &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; - &#x3b4;&#x3b9;' &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;)<p>For whom, that is, for whose sake all things exist. God is the final cause of all things. This is not  equals  &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; unto whom are all things, <a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; which signifies that all things have their realization in God; while this means that all things have their reason in God. By whom, through whose agency, all things came into being. On &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; applied to God, see on <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>. These two emphasize the idea of fitness. It was becoming even to a God who is the beginning and the end of all things.<p>In bringing many sons unto glory (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>Const. bringing with him; not with captain, which would mean "to perfect the captain, etc., as one who led many sons, etc." &#x391;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; is not to be explained who had brought, or after he had brought, with a reference to the O.T. saints, "he had brought many O.T. sons of God unto glory"; but rather, bringing as he did, or in bringing, as A.V. Many sons, since their leader himself was a son. Unto glory, in accordance with the glory with which he himself had been crowned (<a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>). The glory is not distinguished from the salvation immediately following.

The "perfecting" of Jesus corresponds to his being "crowned with glory and honor," although it is not a mere synonym for that phrase; for the writer conceives the perfecting not as an act but as a process. "To make perfect" does not imply moral imperfection in Jesus, but only the consummation of that human experience of sorrow and pain through which he must pass in order to become the leader of his people's salvation.<p>The captain of their salvation (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Comp. <a href="/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; captain, quite frequent in lxx and Class.
