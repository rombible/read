Upon the whole, the apostle proves that after the original rest at the creation, there was a second promised and proposed to the people of God, namely, in Canaan; but yet neither was that the rest intended in the place of the psalm here so often referred to; but a third, which yet remained for them, and was now offered to them, and that under the same promises and threatenings with the former, namely, to be conferred on obedient believers, and withheld from the unbelieving and disobedient.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 The privileges we have under the gospel, are greater than any had under the law of Moses, though the same gospel for substance was preached under both Testaments. There have been in all ages many unprofitable hearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under the word. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painful consequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession, that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then give diligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God. As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will cause those who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest. It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbath remaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or that into which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of the apostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to be enjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, to be the only way of entering that rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he spake - <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>. "And God did rest." "At the close of the work of creation he rested. The work was done. "That" was the rest of God. He was happy in the contemplation of his own works; and he instituted that day to be observed as a memorial of "his" resting from his works, and as a "type" of the eternal rest which remained for man." The idea is this, that the notion of "rest" of some kind runs through all dispensations. It was seen in the finishing of the work of creation; seen in the appointment of the Sabbath; seen in the offer of the promised land, and is seen now in the promise of heaven. All dispensations contemplate "rest," and there must be such a prospect before man now. When it is said that "God did rest," of course it does not mean that he was wearied with his toil, but merely that he "ceased" from the stupendous work of creation. He no more put forth creative energy, but calmly contemplated his own works in their beauty and grandeur; <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>. In carrying forward the great affairs of the universe, he always has been. actively employed <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>, but he is not employed in the work of "creation" properly so called.
