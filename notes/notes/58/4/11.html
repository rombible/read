He has been dealing with two Old Testament passages, one of them, the statement in Genesis that God rested after His creative work; the other, the oath sworn in wrath that Israel should not enter into God’s rest. Combining these two, he draws from them the inferences that there is a rest of God which He enjoys, and of which He has promised to man a share; that the generation to whom the participation therein was first promised, and as a symbol of that participation, the outward possession of the land, fell by unbelief, and died in the wilderness; that the unclaimed promise continued to subsequent generations and continues to this day. All the glories of it, all the terrors of exclusion, the barriers that shut out, the conditions of entrance, the stringent motives to earnestness, are one in all generations. Surface forms may alter; the fundamentals of the religious life, in the promise of God, and the ways by which men may win or miss it, are unchangeable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so the reiterated appeal comes to us with its primeval freshness, saying, after so long a time, ‘Today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have, then, in the words before us, these three things - the rest of God; the barriers against, and the conditions of, entrance; and the labour to secure the entrance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Note then, first, the rest of God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now it is quite possible that the Psalmist, in the passage on which our text foots itself, may have meant by ‘My rest’ nothing more than repose in the land, which rest was God’s since He was the giver of it. But it seems more probable that something of the same idea was floating in his mind, which the writer of this Epistle states so expressly and strongly - viz., that far beyond that outward possession there is the repose of the divine nature in which, marvellous as it may seem, it is possible for a man, in some real fashion, to participate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What, then, is the rest of God? The ‘rest’ which Genesis speaks about was, of course, not repose that recruited exhausted strength, but the cessation of work because the work was complete, the repose of satisfaction in what we should call an accomplished ideal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And, further, in that august conception of the rest of God is included, not only the completion of all His purpose, and the full correspondence of effect with cause, but likewise the indisturbance and inward harmony of that infinite nature whereof all the parts co-operant to an end move in a motion which is rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And, further, the rest of God is compatible with, and, indeed, but another form of, unceasing activity. ‘My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,’ said the Master; though the works were, in one sense, finished from the foundation of the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now can we dare to dream that in any fashion that solemn, divine repose and tranquillity of perfection can be reproduced in us? Yes! The dewdrop is a sphere, as truly as the sun; the rainbow in the smallest drop of rain has all the prismatic colours blended in the same harmony as when the great iris strides across the sky. And if man be made in the image of God, man perfected shall be deiform, even in the matter of his apparently incommunicable repose. For they who are exalted to that final future participation in His life will have to look back, too, upon work which, stained as it has been in the doing, yet, in its being accepted upon the altar on which it was humbly laid, has been sanctified and greatened, and will be an element in their joy in the days that are to come. ‘They rest from their labours, and their works do follow them’ - not for accusation, nor to read to them bitter memories of incompleteness, but rather that they may contribute to the deep repose and rest of the heavens. In a modified form, but yet in reality, the rest of God may be possessed even by the imperfect workers here upon earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And, in like manner, that other aspect of the divine repose, in the tranquillity of a perfectly harmonious nature, is altogether, and without restriction, capable of being reproduced, and certain in the future to be reproduced in all them that love and trust Him, when the whole being shall be settled and centred upon Him, and will and desires and duty and conscience shall no more conflict. ‘Unite my heart to fear Thy name,’ is a prayer even for earth. It will be fully answered in heaven, and the souls made one through all their parts shall rest in God, and shall rest like God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And further, the human participation in that divine repose will have, like its pattern, the blending without disturbance of rest with motion. The highest activity is the intensest repose. Just as a light, whirled with sufficient rapidity, will seem to make a still circle; just as the faster a wheel moves the more moveless it seems to stand; just as the rapidity of the earth’s flight through space, and the universality with which all the parts of it participate in the flight, produce the sensation of absolute immobility. It is not motion, but effort and friction, that break repose; and when there is neither the one nor the other, there will be no contrariety between activity and rest; but we shall enjoy at once the delights of both without the wear and tear and disturbance of the one or the languor of the other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This participation by man in the rest of God, which has its culmination in the future, has its germ in the present. For I suppose that none of the higher blessings which attach to the perfect state of man, as revealed in Scripture, do so belong to that state as that their beginnings are not realised here. All the great promises of Scripture, except those which may point to purely physical conditions, begin to be fulfilled here in the earnest of the inheritance. And so, though toil be our lot, and work against the grain, beyond the strength, and for merely external objects of passing necessity., may be our task here, and the disturbance of rest through sorrows and cares is the experience of all, yet even here, as this Epistle has it, ‘we who have believed do enter into rest.’ The Canaan of the Jew is treated by the writer of this Epistle as having only been a symbol and outward pledge of the deeper repose to which the first receivers of the promise were being trained, if they had been faithful, to look forward and aspire; and the heaven that awaits us, in so far as it is a place and external condition, is in like manner but a symbol and making manifest to sense of the spiritual verity of union with God and satisfaction and rest in Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. So look, secondly, at the barriers against, and the conditions of, entrance into that rest.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>My text says, ‘Lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.’ Now it is to be observed that in this section, of which this is the concluding hortatory portion, there is a double reason given for the failure of that generation to whom the promise was addressed to appropriate it to themselves; and that double representation has been unfortunately obscured in our Authorised Version by a uniform rendering of two different words. Sometimes, as here in my text, we find that the word translated ‘unbelief’ really means disobedience; and sometimes we find that it is correctly translated by the former term. For instance, in the earlier portions of the section, we find a warning against ‘an evil heart of unbelief.’ The word there is correctly translated, Then we find again, ‘To whom He ‘sware in His wrath that they should not enter into His rest; but unto them that believed not,’ where the word ought rather to be ‘them that were disobedient.’ And in the subsequent verse we find the ‘unbelief’ again mentioned. So there are not one but two things stated by the writer as the barriers to entrance - unbelief and its consequence and manifestation as well as root, disobedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the converse, of course, follows. If the barrier be a shut door of unbelief, plated with disobedience, like iron upon an oak portal, then the condition of entrance is faith, with its consequence of submission of will, and obedience of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Notice the important lessons that are given by this alternation of the two ideas of faith and unbelief, obedience and disobedience. Disobedience is the root of unbelief. Unbelief is the mother of further disobedience. Faith is submission, voluntary, within a man’s own power. If it be not exercised the true cause lies deeper than all intellectual ones, lies in the moral aversion of his will and in the pride of independence, which says, ‘Who is Lord over us?’ Why should we have to depend upon Jesus Christ? And as faith is obedience and submission, so faith breeds obedience, and unbelief leads on to higher-handed rebellion. The two interlock each other, foul mother and fouler child; and with dreadful reciprocity of influence the less a man trusts the more he disobeys, the more he disobeys the less he trusts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, then, further, note the respective influence of these two - faith and unbelief; and the other couple, obedience and disobedience, in securing entrance to the rest. Now I desire to bring into connection with this duality of representation, which, as I have said, pervades this section of our letter, our Lord’s blessed words, ‘Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn’ of Me ‘and ye shall find rest.’ There again, we have the double source of rest, and by implication the double source of unrest. For the rest which is given, and the rest which is found, that which ensues from coming to Christ, and that which ensues from taking His yoke upon us and learning of Him, are not the same. But the one is the rest of faith, and the other is the rest of obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, then, consider the repose that ensues from faith, the unrest that dogs unbelief. When a man comes to Christ, then, because Christ enters into him, he enters into rest. There follow the calming of the conscience and reconciliation with God, there is the beginning of the harmonising of the whole nature in one supreme and satisfying love and devotion. These things still the storm and make the incipient Christian life in a true fashion, though in a small measure, participant of the rest of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>People say that it is arbitrary to connect salvation with faith, and talk to us about the ‘injustice’ of men being saved and damned because of their creeds. We are not saved for our faith, nor condemned for our unbelief, but we are saved in our faith, and condemned in our unbelief. Suppose a man did not believe that prussic acid was a poison, and took a spoonful of it and died. You might say that his opinion killed him, but that would only be a shorthand way of saying that his opinion led him to take the thing that did kill him. Suppose a man believes that a medicine will cure him, and takes it, and gets well. Is it the drug or his opinion that cures him? If a certain mental state tends to produce certain emotions, you cannot have the emotions if you will not have the state. Suppose you do not rely upon the promised friendship and help of some one, you cannot have the joy of confidence or the gifts that you do not believe in and do not care for. And so faith is no arbitrary appointment, but the necessary condition, the only condition possible, in the nature of things, by which a man can enter into the rest of God. If we will not let Christ heal our wounds, they must keep on bleeding; if we will not let Him soothe our conscience, it must keep on pricking; if we will not have Him to bring us nigh, we must continue far off; if we will not open the door of our hearts to let Him in, He must stop without. Faith is the condition of entrance; unbelief bars the door of heaven against us, because it bars the door of our hearts against Him who is heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And then, in like manner, obedience and disobedience are respectively conditions of coming into contact or remaining untouched by the powers which give repose. Submission is tranquillity. What disturbs us in this world is neither work nor worry, but wills unconformed to our work, and unsubmissive to our destiny. When we can say, ‘Thy will be done,’ then some faint beginnings of peace steal over our souls, and birds of calm sit brooding even on the yet heaving deep. The ox that kicks against the pricks only makes its hocks bloody. The ox that bows its thick neck to the yoke, and willingly pulls at the burden, has a quiet life. The bird that dashes itself against the wires of its cage bruises its wings and puts its little self into a flutter. When it is content with its limits, its song comes back. Obedience is repose; disobedience is disturbance, and they who trust and submit have entered into rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Now, lastly, a word about the discipline to secure the entrance.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is a singular paradox and bringing together of opposing ideas, is it not, Let us labour to enter into rest? The paradox is not so strong in the Greek as here, but it still is there. For the word translated ‘labour’ carries with it the two ideas of earnestness and of diligence, and this is the condition on which alone we can secure the entrance, either into the full heaven above, or into the incipient heaven here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But note, if we distinctly understand what sort of toil it is that is required to secure it, that settles the nature of the diligence. The main effort of every Christian life, in view of the possibilities of repose that are open to it here and now, and yonder in their perfection, ought to be directed to this one point of deepening and strengthening faith and its consequent obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>You can cultivate your faith, it is within your own power. You can make it strong or weak, operative through your life, or only partially, by fits and starts. And what is required is that Christian people should make a business of their godliness, and give themselves to it as carefully and as consciously and as constantly as they give themselves to their daily pursuits. The men that are diligent in the Christian life, who exercise that commonplace, prosaic, pedestrian, homely virtue of earnest effort, are sure to succeed; and there is no other way to succeed. You cannot go to heaven in silver slippers. But although it be true that heaves is a gift, and that the bread of God is given to us by His Son, the old commandment remains unrepealed, and has as direct and stringent reference to the inward Christian life as to the outward. ‘In the sweat of thy brow thou shalt eat bread,’ though it be at the same time bread that is given thee. And how are we to cultivate our faith? By contemplating the great object which kindles it. Do you do that?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By resolving, with fixed and reiterated determinations, that we will exercise it. ‘I will trust and not be afraid.’ Do you do that? By averting our eyes from the distracting competitors for our interest and attention, in so far as these might enfeeble our confidence. Do you do that? Diligence; that is the secret - a diligence which focuses our powers, and binds our vagrant wills into one strong, solid mass, and delivers us from languor and indolence, and stirs us up to seek the increase of faith as well as of hope and charity. Then, too, obedience is to be cultivated. How do you cultivate obedience? By obeying - by contemplating the great motives that should sway and melt, and sweetly subdue the will, which are all shrined in that one saying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Ye are not your own; ye are bought with a price,’ and by rigidly confining our desires and wishes within the limits of God’s appointment, and religiously referring all things to His supreme will. If thus we do, we shall enter into rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, dear friends, the path is a plain enough one. We all know it. The goal is a clear enough one. I suppose we all believe it. What is wanted is feet that shall run with perseverance the race that is set before us. The word of my text which is translated ‘labour,’ is found in this Epistle in another connection, where the writer desires that we should show ‘the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end.’ It is also caught up by one of the other apostles, who says to us, ‘Giving all diligence, add to your faith’ the manifold virtues of a practical obedience, and so ‘the entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.’ A more authoritative voice points us to the same strenuous effort, for our Lord has said, ‘Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you,’ and when the listeners asked Him what works He would have them do, He answered, bringing all down to one, which being done would produce all others, ‘This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So if we labour to increase our faith, and its fruits of obedience, with a diligence inspired by our earnestness which is kindled by the thought of the sublimity of the reward, and the perils that seek to rob us of our crown, then, even in the wilderness, we shall enter into the Promised Land, and though the busy week of care and toil, of changefulness and sorrow, may disturb the surface of our souls, we shall have an inner sanctuary, where we can shut our doors about us and enjoy a foretaste of the Sabbath-keeping of the heavens, and be wrapped in the stillness of the rest of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let us labour therefore, </span>&c. — That is, since the Israelites were so severely punished for their unbelief, <span class="ital">let us labour </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">σπουδασωμεν</span>, <span class="ital">let us be in earnest, use diligence, </span>and <span class="ital">make haste, </span>(all which particulars are included in the word,) <span class="ital">to enter into that rest </span>— By sincerely believing and steadfastly obeying the gospel, aspiring after and striving to attain every branch of holiness, internal and external; <span class="ital">lest any man fall </span>— Into sin and eternal perdition; <span class="ital">after the same example of unbelief </span>— By reason of such <span class="ital">unbelief </span>as the Israelites gave an <span class="ital">example of.</span> The unbelief against which we are here cautioned, as being the cause of men’s falling under the wrath of God, is chiefly that kind of it which respects the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the body, the reality and greatness of the joys of heaven, and the miseries of hell; the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, men’s sinfulness and guilt, depravity and weakness, and their need of the salvation of the gospel in all its branches, the ability and willingness of Christ to save them from their sins here, and conduct them to the heavenly country hereafter, together with his authority to judge the world, and power to dispense rewards to the righteous, and inflict punishments on the wicked. The unbelief of these great truths, revealed to us in the gospel, being the source of that wickedness which prevails among those called Christians, as well as among Mohammedans and heathen, we ought carefully to cherish a firm and steady belief of these things, lest by the want of a lively sense of them, we be led to live after the manner of the ungodly, and God he provoked to destroy us by the severity of his judgments.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Observe the end proposed: rest spiritual and eternal; the rest of grace here, and glory hereafter; in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven. After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow; and labour now, will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. Let us labour, and quicken each other to be diligent in duty. The Holy Scriptures are the word of God. When God sets it home by his Spirit, it convinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. It makes a soul that has long been proud, to be humble; and a perverse spirit, to be meek and obedient. Sinful habits, that are become as it were natural to the soul, and rooted deeply in it, are separated and cut off by this sword. It will discover to men their thoughts and purposes, the vileness of many, the bad principles they are moved by, the sinful ends they act to. The word will show the sinner all that is in his heart. Let us hold fast the doctrines of Christian faith in our heads, its enlivening principles in our hearts, the open profession of it in our lips, and be subject to it in our lives. Christ executed one part of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executes in heaven, pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings of his people. In the sight of Infinite Wisdom, it was needful that the Saviour of men should be one who has the fellow-feeling which no being but a fellow-creature could possibly have; and therefore it was necessary he should actual experience of all the effects of sin that could be separated from its actual guilt. God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, Ro 8:3; but the more holy and pure he was, the more he must have been unwilling in his nature to sin, and must have had deeper impression of its evil; consequently the more must he be concerned to deliver his people from its guilt and power. We should encourage ourselves by the excellence of our High Priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace. Mercy and grace are the things we want; mercy to pardon all our sins, and grace to purify our souls. Besides our daily dependence upon God for present supplies, there are seasons for which we should provide in our prayers; times of temptation, either by adversity or prosperity, and especially our dying time. We are to come with reverence and godly fear, yet not as if dragged to the seat of justice, but as kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where grace reigns. We have boldness to enter into the holiest only by the blood of Jesus; he is our Advocate, and has purchased all our souls want or can desire.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us therefore labour - Let us earnestly strive.

Not eternal rest; this is not to be entered into now; nor is an entrance into it to be obtained by labour; salvation is not by works; eternal life is a free gift; good works do not go before to prepare heaven for the saints, but follow after: nor is the saints' entrance into it a precarious thing; God has promised it, and provided it for his people; Christ is in the possession of it, and is preparing it for them; and the Spirit of God is working them up for the self same thing, and Christ will give them an abundant entrance into it: but the Gospel rest is here meant, that rest which believers now enter into, and is at this present time for them, <a href="/hebrews/4-3.htm">Hebrews 4:3</a> and though true believers are entered into it, yet their rest, peace, and joy in Christ, is not full; they enter by degrees into it, and by believing enjoy more of it: and this is to be laboured for by prayer, hearing the word, and attendance on ordinances; and this requires strength, diligence, and industry; and supposes difficulties and discouragements, through the corruptions of the heart, and the temptations of Satan; and this is designed to quicken and awaken a godly jealousy in God's people, over themselves: <p>lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief; into the sin of unbelief, and into punishment through it, as the Israelites did; who sinning, their carcasses fell in the wilderness, and they entered not into God's rest, as he swore they should not: true believers may fall into sin, and from a degree of the exercise of grace, and of the steadfastness of the Gospel; but they cannot finally and totally fall away, because they are kept by the power of God; yet they may so fall, as to come short, or at least seem to come short of enjoying the rest and peace of the Gospel state: external professors may fall from the Gospel, and the religion they have professed, and come short of the glory they expected; and fall into just and deserved punishment, in like manner as the unbelieving Israelites did. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</span><p>(3) He returns to an exhortation.<p>(d) Lest any man become a similar example of infidelity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief....">Hebrews 4:11-13</a>.

From <span class="greekheb">πίπτειν εἰς</span> it is distinguished only by a greater degree of significance in that it does not merely like this express the <span class="ital">falling into</span> something, but also the subsequent <span class="ital">lying in</span> the same. Others, as Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Vatablus, Calvin, Schlichting, Jac. Cappellus, Wolf, Bengel, Carpzov, Schulz, Heinrichs, Bleek, de Wette, Stengel, Tholuck, Bisping, Grimm (Theol.

But such intention in connection with the choice of the word is not at all to be assumed), Delitzsch, Riehm (<span class="ital">Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbr</span>. p. 774), Maier, Kluge, Moll, Ewald, take <span class="greekheb">πέσῃ</span> <span class="ital">absolutely</span>: “<span class="ital">fall</span>, i.e. to be brought to ruin, perish.” In that case <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is explained either by <span class="ital">per</span> (Wolf, Stengel, Ewald, <span class="ital">al</span>.), or “conformably to [<span class="ital">gemäss</span>]” (Tholuck), or <span class="ital">propter</span> (Carpzov), or, what with this construction would alone be correct, of <span class="ital">the condition, the state in which one is</span> (Bleek, de Wette, Bisping, Delitzsch, Riehm, Maier, Moll): “in giving the same example.” But this whole construction is artificial. Opposed to it is likewise the position of <span class="greekheb">πέσῃ</span>. For had this word such emphasis as it must have so soon as it is taken in the absolute sense, it would not have been inserted in such subordinate, unaccentuated fashion between the other words, but have been introduced at the very beginning of the proposition: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μή τις πέσῃ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/hebrews/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>. The exhortation follows naturally, “Let us then earnestly strive to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall in the same example of disobedience”. The example of disobedience was that given by the wilderness generation and they are warned not to fall in the same way. <span class="greekheb">πέσῃ ἐν</span> is commonly construed “fall into,” but it seems preferable to render “fall by” or “in”; <span class="greekheb">πέσῃ</span> being used absolutely as in <a href="/romans/14-4.htm" title="Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls.

Vaughan has “lest anyone fall [by placing his foot] in the mark left by the Exodus generation”. <span class="greekheb">ὑπόδειγμα</span> is condemned by Phrynichus who says: <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ τοῦτο ὀρθῶς λέγεται</span>· <span class="greekheb">παράδειγμα λέγε</span>. “In Attic <span class="greekheb">ὑποδείκνυμι</span> was never used except in its natural sense of <span class="ital">show by implication</span>; but in Herodotus and Xenophon it signifies <span class="ital">to mark out, set a pattern</span>.” Rutherford’s <span class="ital">Phryn.</span>, p. 62. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a> of this Epistle with <a href="/john/13-15.htm" title="For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.">John 13:15</a> for both meanings.

Evidently, therefore, <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ</span> is not, as Origen and other interpreters have supposed, the Personal Word incarnate in Christ, but God’s offers and promises. Not only is the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, linking this clause to the promise of rest, decisive for this interpretation; but the mention of <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος τῆς ἀκοῆς</span> in <a href="/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a> and the prominence given in the context to God’s promise make it impossible to think of anything else. To enforce the admonition to believe and obey the word of God, five epithets are added, which, says Westcott, “mark with increasing clearness its power to deal with the individual soul. There is a passage step by step from that which is most general to that which is most personal.” It is, first, <span class="greekheb">ζῶν</span>, “living” or, as A.V. has it, “quick”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm" title="Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.">1 Peter 1:23</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀναγεγεννημένοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">διὰ λόγου ζῶντος Θεοῦ καὶ μένοντος</span>, and <a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1 Peter 1:24</a> <span class="greekheb">τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα</span>. The meaning is that the word remains efficacious, valid and operative, as it was when it came from the will of God. “It is living as being instinct with the life of its source” (Delitzsch). It is also <span class="greekheb">ἐνεργὴς</span>, active, effective, still doing the work it was intended to do, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm" title="So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.">Isaiah 55:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">τομώτερος ὐπὲρ πᾶσαν μάχαιραν δίστομον</span>, “sharper than any two-edged sword”. <span class="greekheb">τομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span> is a more forcible comparative than the genitive; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>. The positive <span class="greekheb">τομός</span> is found in Plato <span class="ital">Tim</span>. 61 E. and elsewhere. <span class="greekheb">δίστομος</span> double-mouthed, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, double-edged, the sword being considered as a devouring beast, see <a href="/2_samuel/11-25.htm" title="Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Let not this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another: make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.">2 Samuel 11:25</a>, <span class="greekheb">καταφάγεται ἡ μάχαιρα</span>. A double-edged sword is not only a more formidable weapon than a single-edged, offering less resistance and therefore cutting deeper (see <a href="/judges/3-16.htm" title="But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment on his right thigh.">Jdg 3:16</a> where Ehud made for himself <span class="greekheb">μάχαιραν δίστομον</span> a span long, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> Eurip., <span class="ital">Helena</span>, 983), but it was a common simile for sharpness as in <a href="/proverbs/5-4.htm" title="But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.">Proverbs 5:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἠκονημένον μάλλον μαχαίρας διστόμου</span>, whetted more than a two-edged sword; and <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">ῥομφαία δίστομος ὀξεῖα</span>. The same comparison is used by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/49-2.htm" title="And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;">Isaiah 49:2</a>) and by St. Paul (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a>); but especially in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/18-15.htm" title="Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,">Wis 18:15</a>, “Thine Almighty Word leaped down from heaven … and brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword. This sharpness is illustrated by its action, <span class="greekheb">διϊκνούμενος ἄχρι μερισμοῦ ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἁρμῶντε καὶ μυελῶν</span>, an expression which does not mean that the word divides the soul from the spirit, the joints from the marrow, but that it pierces through all that is in man to that which lies deepest in his nature. “It is obvious that the writer does not mean anything very specific by each term of the enumeration, which produces its effect by the rhetorical fullness of the expressions” (Farrar). For the expression <span class="ital">cf.</span> Eurip., <span class="ital">Hippol.</span>, 255 <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ἄκρον μυελὸν ψυχῆς</span>. But it is in the succeeding clause that the significance of his description appears; the word is <span class="greekheb">Κριτικὸς ἐνθυμήσεων καὶ ἐννοιῶν καρδίας</span> “judging the conceptions and ideas of the heart”. The word of God coming to men in the offer of good of the highest kind tests their real desires and inmost intentions. When fellowship with God is made possible through His gracious offer, the inmost heart of man is sifted; and it is infallibly discovered and determined whether he truly loves the good and seeks it, or shrinks from accepting it as his eternal heritage. The terms in which this is conveyed find a striking analogy in Philo (<span class="ital">Quis. Rer. Div. Haer.</span>, p. 491) where he speaks of God by His Word “cutting asunder the constituent parts of all bodies and objects that seem to be coherent and united. Which [the word] being whetted to the keenest possible edge, never ceases to pierce all sensible objects, and when it has passed through them to the things that are called atoms and indivisible, then again this cutting instrument begins to divide those things which are contemplated by reason into untold and indescribable portions.” <span class="ital">Cf.</span> p. 506. In addition to this (<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>), the inward operation of the word finds its counterpart in the searching, inevitable inquisition of God Himself with whom we have to do. “No created thing is hidden before Him (God) but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.” <span class="greekheb">τετραχηλισμένα</span> has created difficulty. <span class="greekheb">τραχηλίζω</span> is a word of the games, meaning “to bend back the neck” and so “to overcome”. In this sense of overmastering it was in very common use. In Philo, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, men are spoken of as <span class="greekheb">f1τετραχηλισμένοι ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις</span>. This meaning, however, gives a poor sense in our passage where it is followed by <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς</span>. Chrysostom says the word is derived from the skinning of animals, and Theophylact, enlarging upon this interpretation, explains that when the victims had their throats cut, the skin was dragged off from the neck downwards exposing the carcase. No confirmation of this use of the word is given. Perizonius in a note on Ælian, <span class="ital">Var., Hist.</span>, xii. 58, refers to Suetonius, <span class="ital">Vitell.</span>, 17, where Vitellius is described as being dragged into the forum, half-naked, with his hands tied behind his back, a rope round his neck and his dress torn; and we are further told that they dragged back his head by his hair, and even pricked him under the chin with the point of a sword as they are wont to do to criminals, that he might let his face be seen and not hang his head. [So, too, Elsner, who refers to Perizonius and agrees that the word means <span class="ital">resupïnata, manifesta</span>, eorum quasi cervice ac facie reflexa, atque adeo <span class="ital">intuentium oculis exposita</span>, genere loquendi ab iis petito, quorum capita reclinantur, ne intuentium oculos fugiant et lateant; quod hominibus qui ad supplicium ducebantur, usu olim accidebat.” <span class="ital">Cf.</span> “Sic fatus galeam laeva tenet, atque reflexa Cervice orantis capulo tenus applicat ensem.” Virgil, <span class="ital">Æn</span>. x. 535.] Certainly this bending back of the head to expose the face gives an excellent and relevant sense here. The reason for thus emphasising the penetrating and inscrutable gaze of God is given in the description appended in the relative clause; it is He <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος</span>, which, so far as the mere words go, might mean “of whom we speak” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/1-7.htm" title="And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.">Hebrews 1:7</a> and <a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11</a>), but which obviously must here be rendered, as in A.V., “with whom we have to do,” or “with whom is our reckoning,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm" title="Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.">Hebrews 13:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a> to <a href="/hebrews/10-15.htm" title="Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,">Hebrews 10:15</a> the writer treats of the Priesthood of the Son. The first paragraph extends from <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a> to <a href="/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>, and in this it is shown that Jesus has the qualifications of a priest, a call from God, and the sympathy which makes intercession hearty and real. The writer’s purpose is to encourage his readers to use the intercession of Christ with confidence, notwithstanding their sense of sinfulness. And he does so by reminding them that all High priests are appointed for the very purpose of offering sacrifice for sin, and that this office has not been assumed by them at their own instance but at the call of God. It is because God desires that sinful men be brought near to Him that priests hold office. And those are called to office, who by virtue of their own experience are prepared to enter into cordial sympathy with the sinner and heartily seek to intercede for him. All this holds true of Christ. He is Priest in obedience to God’s call. The office, as He had to fill it, involved much that was repugnant. With strong crying and tears He shrank from the death that was necessary to the fulfilment of His function. But His godly caution prompted as His ultimate prayer, that the will of the Father and not His own might be done. Thus by the things He suffered He learned obedience, and being thus perfected became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey Him, greeted and proclaimed High Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/hebrews/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Let us labour</span>] Lit., “let us be zealous,” or “give diligence” (<a href="/context/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:...">2 Peter 1:10-11</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Php 3:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lest any man</span>] See note on <a href="/hebrews/4-1.htm" title="Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.">Hebrews 4:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of unbelief</span>] Rather, “of disobedience.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐκείνην</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) future, great.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ</span>) <span class="ital">in</span> or <span class="ital">after the same</span>, as those men of former times.—<span class="greekheb">ὑποδείγματι</span>, <span class="ital">example</span>) The same word is found at <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-23.htm" title="It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.">Hebrews 9:23</a>.

It is a question, though not at all affecting the general sense of the passage, whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> should not he translated "fall <span class="accented">into</span> the same example." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> has undoubtedly the sense of "to fall into," and is frequently so used in the LXX., and the subordinate position of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> in the sentence - between <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - is against its being used absolutely as the emphatic word. If so, the meaning will be "fall into the same <span class="accented">exemplar</span> of disobedience," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the kind of disobedience of which that of the Israelites was a sample. This interpretation of the phrase, being that of the Vulgate, is supported by Alford, Davison, Lunemann; though most modern commentators (Bengel, Bleek, De Wette, Tholuck, Delitzsch, Wordsworth), with Chrysostom, take <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> absolutely, as in <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a> (<span class="accented">ruat</span>, Bengel), and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as meaning, "so as to present the same (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> a like) example of disobedience," the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, according to Delitzsch, being the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> of state or condition. The warning is next enforced by a vivid representation of the penetrating and resistless power of the "Word of God." The question arises whether "the Word of God" is here to be understood in St. John's sense of the <span class="accented">Hypostatic Word, i.e.</span> the Second Person of the holy Trinity, who became incarnate in Christ. It is so understood by the Fathers generally; and the fact of this Epistle being tinged generally with the thought and terminology of Philo (whose use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, derived from the Platonic philosophy in combination with Jewish theology, seems to anticipate in some degree, however vaguely, the doctrine of St. John) gives some countenance to the view. But against it are the following considerations: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Christ is not elsewhere in this Epistle designated as "the Word" but as "the SON." His eternal relation to the Father, though otherwise plainly intimated, is not expressed by this term, as it was by St. John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The description of the Word, <span class="accented">as</span> "<span class="accented">sharper</span> than any two-edged sword," is not suitable to the Hypostatic Word himself, but rather to the utterance of his power. Thus in <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, "<span class="accented">the</span> Son of <span class="accented">man</span>," and in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, "<span class="accented">he</span> whose name is called the Word of <span class="accented">God</span>," has a "<span class="accented">sharp</span> two-edged sword proceeding out of his mouth." The sword is not himself, but that which "came forth out of his mouth." Cf. <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked;" cf. also <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, "The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." Hence, notwithstanding the prevailing view of the Fathers, it seems best to understand the term here as meaning generally the Divine utterance, without definite reference to the Hypo-static Word. It was the Word of God, in this sense, that debarred the ancient Israelites from their rest, and doomed them in the wilderness; it is the same Word which still more, as being uttered in the Son, is so searching and resistless now. True, it is through the Hypostatic Word that the Godhead has ever operated, of old as well as now, being God's eternal utterance of himself: the only question is whether this truth is here intended to be expressed, or, in other words, whether <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has here the personal sense in which St. John uses the term. It is possible that the writer passes in thought to a personal sense in the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of ver. 13, where <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> preceding, rather than to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But certainly at the beginning of the passage this specific sense does not seem to be suggested either by the context or the language used. Ver. 12. - For living is the Word of God, and powerful (or, <span class="accented">effectual</span>; <span class="accented">cf.</span> <a href="/philemon/1-6.htm">Philemon 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>), and sharper than any two- edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Observe how the predicates form a climax. The Word of God is, first, <span class="accented">living</span>, instinct with the life of the living God who utters it, itself a living power (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>); then, not only so, but also <span class="accented">operative, effective</span> of its purpose; then, in this its operation, more keenly <span class="accented">cutting</span> than any sword; cutting so as to <span class="accented">perpetrate</span> through and through - through the whole inner being of man to its inmost depths; then, in doing so, <span class="accented">discerning</span> and opening to judgment all the secrets of his consciousness. This description of the power of the Word of God is given as a reason fur the warning, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> etc., "Let us give diligence," etc.; <span class="accented">for</span>, if we slight the Word of God, we can have no escape from its irresistible operation; we shall be thoroughly exposed and inevitably judged. The view of the Word of God having a sharply <span class="accented">cutting</span> operation is found in Philo, from whom Bleek cites a series of passages cognate to this in the Epistle. Cf. especially one in the treatise, 'Quis Rerum Divinorum Haeres.:' <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>    <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>, etc. And for the comparison to a sword, cf. (as above referred to) <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; and <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>. The true reading of the part of the sentence, "of soul and spirit," etc., is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus after <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> being ill supported. The second <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, after <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, is therefore most naturally taken, and so as to give the best sense, in the sense of "both," not "and;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the second clause is not to be taken as denoting a further dividing - of the bodily parts as well as of the soul and spirit, but as expressing, by recurrence to the figure of a sword, the thoroughness of the division of soul and spirit. Further, the division spoken of is surely not of the soul <span class="accented">from</span> the spirit, as some have taken it. Delitzsch, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, explains to this effect - that in fallen man his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which proceeded from God and carries in itself the Divine image, has become, "as it were, extinguished;" that "through the operation of grace man recalls to mind his own true nature, though shattered by sin;" "that heavenly nature or' man reappears when Christ is formed in him;" and thus the Word of God "marks out and separates" the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in him from the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> in which it had been, "<span class="accented">as</span> it were, <span class="accented">extinguished."</span> Then, taking the clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, to express a further process of dissection, he explains by saying that the Word of God "exhibits to man the fact that ungodly powers are working also in his <span class="accented">bodily</span> frame, which has now in every joint and chord and marrow become the seat of sin and death, and so "<span class="accented">goes</span> on to scrutinize" his bodily as well as his spiritual part," and "lays bare before the eyes of God and before his own the whole man thus described." But the idea of the separation, in the above sense, of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, even if tenable, is certainly far-fetched, and that of the corporeal dissection supposed is hardly intelligible. Further, the "dividing" of the bodily parts spoken of in the text (whether an illustration or a further process) does not suggest the separation of one part from another, since a sword does not divide the joints or the limbs (whichever be meant by <span class="accented">apathy</span>) <span class="accented">from</span> the marrow, though it may penetrate both. We may explain thus: It is well known that St. Paul divides man's complex nature into body, soul, and spirit - <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). His bodily organization (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is not apparently here under consideration, except in regard to the figure of the sword; the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> is his animal life or soul, the seat (so to speak) of his sensations, and of his natural affections and desires; his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is the more Divine part of his nature, in virtue of which he has a conscience, aspires after holiness, apprehends spiritual mysteries, holds communion with God, and is influenced by the Divine Spirit. The idea, then, is that, as a very keen sword not only cuts through the joints dividing bone from bone, but also through the bones themselves into the marrow within them, so the Word of God penetrates and discloses not,, . only. the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> too, "piercing through soul and spirit, <span class="accented">yea</span> [with reference to the illustration used] through both joints [or, 'limbs'] and marrow." Ebrard, taking <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "limbs" (a sense in which the word is used, though that of "joints" is its proper and more usual one), regards these and the "marrow" as corresponding respectively to the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>: the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> being understood as "something lying deep in man, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> lying still deeper." Thus as a very trenchant sword cuts through, not only the limbs, but also the marrow within them, so the Word of God penetrates, not only that part of human consciousness which is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, but also that deeper and more inward part which is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. But the general sense of the passage is plain enough without our supposing this strict analogy to have been intended. Expositors, in their analysis of the meaning of passages, may often detect more than the author thought cf. On <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "a discerner of"), cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24, 25</a>, where the effects of the Word of God, brought to bear through the gift of prophecy on one without the gift entering into a congregation of prophesying Christians, are thus described: "<span class="accented">he</span> is convinced of all, he is judged [rather, 'examined,' 'scrutinized,' <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>] of all; the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you [or, 'among you'] of a truth." So searching and judicial is the power of the Word of God, that it reaches and discloses the inmost depths of a man's consciousness - discloses them to himself, and, though he should resist, leaves him without escape, exposed and judged. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>This promise of rest carries with it a special responsibility for the people of God.<p>Let us labor therefore (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>For the verb, see on <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>.
