There have been in all ages many unprofitable hearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under the word. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painful consequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession, that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then give diligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God. As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will cause those who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest. It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbath remaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or that into which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of the apostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to be enjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, to be the only way of entering that rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again, he limiteth - He designates, or definitely mentions. The word rendered "limiteth" - &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  horizei - means to "bound," to set a boundary - as of a field or farm; and then to determine or fix definitely, to designate, appoint. Here it means, that he specifies particularly, or mentions expressly.<p>A certain day - A particular time; he mentions today particularly. That is, in the time of David, he uses the word "today," as if time was "then" an offer of rest, and as if it were then possible to enter into it. The object of the additional thought was to show that the offer of rest was not confined to the Israelites to whom it was first made; that David regarded it as existing in his day; and that man might even then be invited to come and partake of the rest that was promised. "Nearly five hundred years after the time when the Israelites were going to the promised land, and when the offer of rest was made to them, we hear David speaking of "rest" still; rest which Was offered in his time, and which might then be lost by hardening the heart. It could not be, therefore, that the offer of rest pertained merely to the promised land. It must be something in advance of that. It must be something existing in the time of David. It must be an offer of heaven." A Jew might feel the force of this argument more than we do; still it is conclusive to prove the point under consideration, that there was a rest spoken of long after the offer of the promised land, and that all the promises could not have pertained to that.<p>Saying in David - In a Psalm composed by David, or rather perhaps, saying "by" David; that is, God spake by him.<p>Today - Now - that is, even in the time of David.<p>After so long a time - That is, so long after the first promise was made; to wit, about 500 years. These are the words of Paul calling attention to the fact that so long a time after the entrance into the promised land there was still a speaking of "today," as if even then they were called to partake of the rest.<p>As it is said - To quote it exactly; or to bring the express authority of the Scriptures. It is expressly said even after that long time, "today - or now, if you will hear his voice." All this is to prove that even in that time there was an offer of rest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/hebrews/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

V., of which the reading, rendering, and punctuation are here alike infelicitous to an extent which destroys for ordinary readers the meaning of the passage. It should be rendered (putting only a comma at the end of <a href="/hebrews/4-6.htm" title="Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:">Hebrews 4:6</a>), “<span class="ital">Again, he fixes a day, To-day, saying in David, so long afterwards, even as has been said before, To-day if ye will hear</span>,” &c. In the stress laid upon the word “to-day” we find a resemblance to Philo, who defines “to-day” as “the infinite and interminable aeon,” and says “Till to-day, that is for ever” (<span class="ital">Leg. Allegg.</span> iii. 8; <span class="ital">De Profug.</span> 11). The argument is that “David” (a general name for the “Psalmist”) had, nearly five centuries after the time of Moses, and three millenniums after the Creation, still spoken of God’s rest as an offer open to mankind. If we regard this as a mere verbal argument, turning on the attribution of deep mystic senses to the words “rest” and “to-day,” and on the trains of inference which are made to depend on these words, we must remember that such a method of dealing with Scripture phraseology was at this period universally current among the Jews. But if we stop at this point all sorts of difficulties arise; for if the “rest” referred to in Psalms 95 was primarily the land of Canaan (as in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/1-34.htm" title="And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,...">Deuteronomy 1:34-36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm" title="For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 12:9</a>, &c.), the oath of God, “they shall not enter into my rest” only applied to the generation of the wandering, and He had said “Your little ones … them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised,” <a href="/numbers/14-31.htm" title="But your little ones, which you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have despised.">Numbers 14:31</a>. If, on the other hand, “the rest” meant heaven, it would be against all Scripture analogy to assume that all the Israelites who died in the wilderness were excluded from future happiness. And there are many other difficulties which will at once suggest themselves. The better and simpler way of looking at this, and similar trains of reasoning, is to regard them as particular modes of expressing blessed and eternal truths, and to look on the Scripture language applied to them in the light rather of <span class="ital">illustration</span> than of Scriptural proof. Quite apart from this Alexandrian method of finding recondite and mystic senses in the history and language of the Bible, we see the deep and glorious truths that God’s offer of “Rest” in the highest sense—of participation in His own rest—is left open to His people in the eternal today of merciful opportunity. The Scripture illustration must be regarded as quite subordinate to the essential truth, and not the essential truth made to depend on the Scripture phraseology. When God says “They shall not enter my rest,” the writer—reading as it were between the lines with the eyes of Christian enlightenment—reads the promise “but others <span class="ital">shall</span> enter into my rest,” which was most true.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">saying in David</span>] A common abbreviated form of quotation like “saying in Elijah” for “in the part of Scripture about Elijah” (<a href="/romans/9-2.htm" title="That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.">Romans 9:2</a>). The quotation may mean no more than “in the Book of Psalms.” The 95th Psalm is indeed attributed to David in the LXX; but the superscriptions of the LXX, like those of our A. V., are wholly without authority, and are in some instances entirely erroneous. The date of the Psalm is more probably the close of the Exile. We may here notice the fondness of the writer for the Psalms, of which he quotes no less than <span class="ital">eleven</span> in this Epistle (Psalms 2, 8, 22, 40, 45, 95, 102, 104, 105, 118, 135).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/hebrews/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/hebrews/4-7.htm" title="Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.">Hebrews 4:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πάλιν</span>, <span class="ital">again</span>) Who would have thought that there is a sermon so important and so solemn in the 95th Psalm?
