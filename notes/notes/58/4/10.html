This verse is added to explain and justify the reference to a “sabbath” in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a>. Man’s sabbath-rest begins when he enters into God’s rest (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2</a>); as that was the goal of the creative work, so to the people of God this rest is the goal of their life of “works.”<p>As the whole argument is reviewed, the question may naturally be asked, To what extent is this wide meaning present in the Psalm itself? Where must the line be drawn between the direct teaching of the words and the application here made? The apparent expansion of the meaning of the Psalm relates to <a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a> alone. There, in the first instance, an historical fact is mentioned—the exclusion of the rebels from the promised land. But though the mention of the oath of God is derived from <a href="/context/numbers/14-28.htm" title="Say to them, As truly as I live, said the LORD, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:">Numbers 14:28-30</a>, the language of the historian is significantly changed; for “ye shall not come into the land,” we read, “they shall not enter into My rest.” True, the land could be spoken of as their “rest and inheritance” (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-9.htm" title="For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 12:9</a>); but the language which the Psalmist chooses is at all events susceptible of a much higher and wider meaning, and (as some of the passages quoted in the Note on <a href="/hebrews/3-11.htm" title="So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)">Hebrews 3:11</a> serve to prove) may have been used in this extended sense long before the Psalmist’s age. That <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm" title="For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.">Hebrews 4:8</a>, when placed by the side of <a href="/hebrews/4-11.htm" title="Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.">Hebrews 4:11</a>, shows the higher meaning of the words to have been in the Psalmist’s thought, and implies that the offer of admission to the rest of God was still made, it seems unreasonable to doubt. As the people learnt through ages of experience and training (see <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?">Hebrews 1:5</a>) to discern the deeper and more spiritual meaning that lay in the promises of the King and the Son of David, so was it with other promises which at first might seem to have no more than a temporal significance. If these considerations are well founded, it follows that we have no right to look on the argument of this section as an “accommodation” or a mere application of Scripture: the Christian preacher does but fill up the outline which the prophet had drawn.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/hebrews/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/4-10.htm" title="For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.">Hebrews 4:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">For </span>that rest of which we were speaking, may properly be called a sabbatical rest, or the celebration of a sabbath; for <span class="ital">he that </span>hath <span class="ital">entered into </span>this <span class="ital">his </span>final and complete <span class="ital">rest, hath ceased from his own works </span>— From all his labours and toils; <span class="ital">as God did from his </span>— In that first seventh- day, which, in commemoration of it, was appointed to be kept holy in all future ages. Probably God appointed men to rest on the seventh day, not only in commemoration of his having rested on that day, but to teach them that their happiness in a future state will consist in resting from their work of trial, and in reviewing it after it is finished, as God, when he rested from the work of creation, surveyed the whole, and pronounced it good. From this account of <span class="ital">the rest which remaineth for the people of God, </span>namely, that they do not enter into it till their works of trial and suffering are finished, it is evident that the <span class="ital">rest </span>which is here said to remain to them is the rest of heaven, of which the seventh-day rest is only an imperfect emblem.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-10 The privileges we have under the gospel, are greater than any had under the law of Moses, though the same gospel for substance was preached under both Testaments. There have been in all ages many unprofitable hearers; and unbelief is at the root of all unfruitfulness under the word. Faith in the hearer is the life of the word. But it is a painful consequence of partial neglect, and of a loose and wavering profession, that they often cause men to seem to come short. Let us then give diligence, that we may have a clear entrance into the kingdom of God. As God finished his work, and then rested from it, so he will cause those who believe, to finish their work, and then to enjoy their rest. It is evident, that there is a more spiritual and excellent sabbath remaining for the people of God, than that of the seventh day, or that into which Joshua led the Jews. This rest is, a rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state. And a rest in glory, where the people of God shall enjoy the end of their faith, and the object of all their desires. The rest, or sabbatism, which is the subject of the apostle's reasoning, and as to which he concludes that it remains to be enjoyed, is undoubtedly the heavenly rest, which remains to the people of God, and is opposed to a state of labour and trouble in this world. It is the rest they shall obtain when the Lord Jesus shall appear from heaven. But those who do not believe, shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or glory hereafter. God has always declared man's rest to be in him, and his love to be the only real happiness of the soul; and faith in his promises, through his Son, to be the only way of entering that rest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/hebrews/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he that is entered into rest - That is, the man who is so happy as to reach heaven, will enjoy a rest similar to what God had when he finished the work of creation. It will be:<p>(1) a cessation from toil; and,<p>(2) it will be a rest similar to that of God - the same kind of enjoyment, the same freedom from care, anxiety, and labor.<p>How happy then are they who have entered into heaven! Their toils are over. Their labors are done. Never again will they know fatigue. Never more will they feel anxious care.

From the abodes of bliss we shall not be sent forth to speak to our kindred of the blessedness of that world, or to admonish our friends to escape from the place of despair. The pastor will not come again to warn and invite his people; the parent will not come again to tell his children of the Saviour and of heaven; the neighbor will not come to admonish his neighbor; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24-29</a>.

For&#8212;justifying and explaining the word "rest," or "Sabbatism," just used (see on [2549]Heb 4:9).<p>he that is entered&#8212;whosoever once enters.<p>his rest&#8212;God's rest: the rest prepared by God for His people [Estius]. Rather, "His rest": the man's rest: that assigned to him by God as his. The Greek is the same as that for "his own" immediately after.<p>hath ceased&#8212;The Greek aorist is used of indefinite time, "is wont to cease," or rather, "rest": rests. The past tense implies at the same time the certainty of it, as also that in this life a kind of foretaste in Christ is already given [Grotius] (Jer 6:16; Mt 11:28, 29). Our highest happiness shall, according to this verse, consist in our being united in one with God, and moulded into conformity with Him as our archetype [Calvin].<p>from his own works&#8212;even from those that were good and suitable to the time of doing work. Labor was followed by rest even in Paradise (Ge 2:3, 15). The work and subsequent rest of God are the archetype to which we should be conformed. The argument is: He who once enters rest, rests from labors; but God's people have not yet rested from them, therefore they have not yet entered the rest, and so it must be still future. Alford translates, "He that entered into his (or else God's, but rather 'his'; Isa 11:10, 'His rest': 'the joy of the Lord,' Mt 25:21, 23) rest (namely, Jesus, our Forerunner, Heb 4:14; 6:20, 'The Son of God that is passed through the heavens': in contrast to Joshua the type, who did not bring God's people into the heavenly rest), he himself (emphatical) rested from his works (Heb 4:4), as God (did) from His own" (so the Greek, "works"). The argument, though generally applying to anyone who has entered his rest, probably alludes to Jesus in particular, the antitypical Joshua, who, having entered His rest at the Ascension, has ceased or rested from His work of the new creation, as God on the seventh day rested from the work of physical creation. Not that He has ceased to carry on the work of redemption, nay, He upholds it by His mediation; but He has ceased from those portions of the work which constitute the foundation; the sacrifice has been once for all accomplished. Compare as to God's creation rest, once for all completed, and rested from, but now still upheld (see on [2550]Heb 4:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/hebrews/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This proveth the foregoing consequence of a rest remaining, from the nature of a true rest, which is a resting from all labours, which the Israelites did not in Canaan, therefore it is yet to come. For every true believer who hath full possession of God’s rest, where God is satisfying of them in bliss, they rest in his loves, of which the sabbath and Canaan were but types. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He also hath ceased from his own works; </span> such true Christians have ceased and rested from all their sinful works and labours, as works of callings, miseries, anxieties, and sufferings of any kind, resting from them perfectly and perpetually, having finished all his work of evangelical obedience through them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As God did from his; </span> they have rested not in a parity of rest, or work in kind, but as God from his own in likeness of order, his work going before rest, and of rest fitted for believers by him conformable to his own. Some refer these words and the relative <span class="ital">he</span> to our Lord Jesus Christ, as Head of his body, the church of true believers; and that the parallel runs between God the Father and him in the works of the old and new creation, which works were good and complete in their different kinds, in their cessation from them, and their rest in their respective sabbaths, both days being founded thereon; and that believers shall be conformable to their Head, treading in his steps in doing and suffering, and then in rest. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/hebrews/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he that is entered into his rest, &amp;c. This is to be understood not of believers, nor of their entrance into the Gospel rest, or into eternal rest, but of the Lord Jesus Christ; for a single person is only spoken of, and not many, as in <a href="/hebrews/4-3.htm">Hebrews 4:3</a> and the rest entered into is his own, which cannot be said of any other; and besides, a comparison is run between his entrance into rest, and ceasing from his works, and God's resting the seventh day, and ceasing from his, which can only agree with him; and besides, Christ is immediately spoken of, and at large described in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>. Now he entered into his rest, not when he was laid in the grave, but when he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God, as having done his work; and this is the ground and foundation of the saints' rest under the Gospel dispensation; for these words are a reason of the former, as appears by the causal particle "for": and now being at rest, <p>he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his; Christ had works to do, as preaching the Gospel, performing miracles, and obtaining the redemption and salvation of his people: these were given him to do, and he undertook them, and he has finished them; and so ceases from them, as never to repeat them more; they being done effectually, stand in no need of it; and so as to take delight and complacency in them; the pleasure of the Lord prospering in, his hand, the effects of his labour answering his designs; just as God ceased from the works of creation, when he had finished them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/hebrews/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{c}</span> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God <i>did</i> from his.</span><p>(c) As God rested the seventh day, so must we rest from our works, that is, from those things that proceed from our corrupt nature.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/hebrews/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/hebrews/4-10.htm" title="For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.">Hebrews 4:10</a>.

There are two ways of understanding this verse. Its general intention is, indeed, clear. It accounts for the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> which precedes, expressing that the true meaning of "God's rest" is not satisfied by any earthly rest, but only by one like his. The question is whether the verse is to be taken as a general proposition or as referring specifically to Christ. In favor of the latter view is the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">literal</span> translation would be "He that entered...  himself also <span class="accented">rested."</span> Ebrard, on this ground, strenuously defends the reference to Christ; and also on the ground of parallelism with <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first division of the general argument. In the first division (<a href="/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>.) the course of thought was - Dominion over creation has been assigned to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man fulfils his destiny. In this second division the corresponding course of drought is - God's rest has been offered to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man may enter it. And thus (as has been explained above) the conclusion that Jesus is the High Priest of humanity is led up to by two parallel lines of argument. But the third of the propositions of the second line of argument (corresponding to <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first) is not distinctly expressed unless it be in the verse before us; and therefore this verse, on this ground as well as that of the use of the aorist, is taken to refer to Christ. On the other hand, it is argued (Bleek, Do Wette, Delitzsch, etc.) that, if a specific reference to Christ had been intended, he would have been mentioned, so as to make the meaning clear; and secondly, that the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is legitimate, though the proposition be a general one. Delitzsch explains it thus: "The author might have written <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or (more classically) <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: but he has taken up into the main proposition the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which properly belongs (according to <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>) to the clause of comparison: whosoever has entered God's rest, of him the '<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> holds good in the same manner as of God." And, further, it is to be observed that the Greek aorist may sometimes be put for the present, "to express an action completely determined, every doubt as to its truth and unalterableness being removed" (Matthiae, 'Gr. Gram.,' &sect; 506). In this instance the idea might be - he that has entered into God's rest rested, when he so entered, from all his works, etc. On the whole, it appears that specific reference to Christ is <span class="accented">not</span> apparent from the immediate context, or required by the mere language used. Still, in consideration of the general argument, we may take the writer to have meant his readers to understand that it was Christ who <span class="accented">had</span> so entered the rest of God, so as to lead God's people into it. That this is so appears from ver. 14,  <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x37e;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, which seems to require that preceding link of thought. - Among man's deepest feelings is a longing for rest. Haply in the freshness and ardor of early life not deeply felt, it recurs from time to time, and grows stronger with advancing years. Nothing in life fully satisfies this longing. Labors, distresses, disappointments, anxieties, never allow the desired repose. Few there are whose hearts have not sometimes echoed the psalmist's words, "Oh that I had wings like a dove! For then would I flee away, and be at rest!" Many since Job have felt something of his longing to be where "the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest." Is there to be no satisfaction ever of this deep human craving? Holy Scripture meets it as it meets all others. It spoke of a rest of God above creation from the beginning of time; it intimated man's part and interest in it by the weekly sabbath which he was to keep with God. But this was, after all, but a symbol and earnest of something unattained. At length a fuller realization of the longed-for rest was held out to the chosen people, and the Promised Land was pictured beforehand in the colors of an earthly Paradise. Forfeited, when first offered, through the people's unworthiness (representing by an historical parable the bar to man's entrance into the eternal rest), it was attained at last. But the true rest still came not. Canaan, like the sabbath, proved but a symbol of something unattained. Yet the old longing for rest went on, and inspired men went on proclaiming it as attainable and still to come. The irrepressible craving, the suggestive symbols, the prophetic anticipations, are all fulfilled in Christ. He, when he had passed with us through this earthly scene of labor, entered, with our nature, into that eternal rest of God, to prepare a place for us, having by his atonement removed the bar to human entrance. Through our faith in him we are assured that our deep-seated craving for satisfaction unattained as yet, which we express by the term "<span class="accented">rest</span>," is a true inward prophecy, and that, though we find it not <span class="accented">here</span>, we may through him, if we are faithful, confidently expect it <span class="accented">there</span>, where "<span class="accented">beyond</span> these voices there is peace." There now follows (vers. 11-14) a renewal of the warning of <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-4:1</a>, urged now with increased force in view of the danger of slighting such a revelation as the gospel has been shown to be; after which (ver. 14, etc.) come words of encouragement, based on the view, now a second time arrived at, of Christ being our great High Priest. And thus the exposition of his priesthood, which follows in <a href="/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, is led up to. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/hebrews/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Only in such a Sabbath-rest is found the counterpart of God's rest on the seventh day.<p>For he that is entered into his rest (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Whoever has once entered.

The statement is a general proposition: any one who has entered into God's rest has ceased from his works.<p>As God did from his (&#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;)<p>Rend. as God (did) from his own. &#x399;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; own signifies more than mere possession. Rather, works peculiarly his own, thus hinting at the perfect nature of the original works of creation as corresponding with God's nature and bearing his impress. The blessing of the Sabbath-rest is thus put as a cessation from labors. The basis of the conception is Jewish, the rest of the Sabbath being conceived as mere abstinence from labor, and not according to Christ's conception of the Sabbath, as a season of refreshment and beneficent activity, <a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>; <a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>. Our writer's conception is not the rabbinical conception of cessation of work, but rather of the cessation of the weariness and pain which accompany human labor.
