If no amount of anxious care can add one cubit to our stature or the measure of our days (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/6-27.htm" title="Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?">Matthew 6:27</a>), how much less can we control all the myriad contingencies upon which the happiness of the future may depend!<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:22-40 Christ largely insisted upon this caution not to give way to disquieting, perplexing cares, Mt 6:25-34. The arguments here used are for our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right way to get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom to take it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ. Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts of evil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. If we value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries of life. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only working servants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for their lord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him. In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming to call his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. We are uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should therefore be always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thus wise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the good man of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief would come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25, 26. which of you, &c.&#8212;Corroding solicitude will not bring you the least of the things ye fret about, though it may double the evil of wanting them.

C.). But adding to one’s stature a cubit or an inch is of minimum <span class="ital">importance</span> as compared with lengthening our days. Yet it must be owned that Lk.’s <span class="greekheb">ἐλάχιστον</span> puts us off the track of the idea intended, if we take <span class="greekheb">ἡλικία</span> = stature. The point is, <span class="ital">we</span> cannot do what God has done for all mature persons: added a cubit at least to the stature of their childhood, and this is the <span class="ital">greater</span> thing, not the least, greater than giving us the means of life now that we have reached maturity. <span class="ital">Vide</span> notes on Mt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/12-26.htm" title="If you then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take you thought for the rest?">Luke 12:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὔτε ἐλάχιστον</span>, <span class="ital">not even that which is least</span>) The argument is drawn from the greater to the less in <a href="/luke/12-23.htm" title="The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.">Luke 12:23</a>. Now it is by an argument from the less to the greater that the truth is shown, that our anxieties are vain and driftless. To add a cubit to the stature of a man already born and in full strength, was regarded by Jesus as a thing the least difficult with God Almighty, and as even a less exertion of power than the remarkable increase of the five loaves, etc., ch. <a href="/luke/9-16.htm" title="Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.">Luke 9:16</a>. On the contrary, it is the greatest exhibition of power, that He has given us stature itself and strength of body, whereby the necessaries of life are obtained,—nay more, hath given us the soul along with the body: and year by year, and day by day, produces corn, wine, oil, spices, fruits, berries, vegetables, herbs, cows, sheep, wild beasts, birds, and fishes, and preserves and maintains the whole world of nature. These are the <span class="greekheb">τῶν λοιπῶν</span>, <span class="ital">the rest</span>, the other remaining things, which are much less in our power than the height of our stature: and yet they have a much closer connection with our sustenance than our stature has.</body></html>
