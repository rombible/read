The arguments here used are for our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right way to get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom to take it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ. Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts of evil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. If we value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries of life. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only working servants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for their lord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him. In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming to call his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. We are uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should therefore be always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thus wise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the good man of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief would come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-31.
