The arguments here used are for our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right way to get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom to take it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ. Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts of evil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. If we value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries of life. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only working servants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for their lord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him. In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming to call his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. We are uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should therefore be always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thus wise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the good man of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief would come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25, 26. which of you, &c.&#8212;Corroding solicitude will not bring you the least of the things ye fret about, though it may double the evil of wanting them.

A man is not likely to wish that a hand-breadth or a foot, much less a cubit, should be added to his height: but he who is unduly anxious as to his life (what he is to eat, drink, and put on), in reality, even though unconsciously, wishes for greater stature, wherewith he may expend more toil and make more gain.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Stature (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>The original meaning of the word is time of life, age. So, commonly, in classical Greek. See, also, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/9-21.htm">John 9:21</a>, <a href="/john/9-23.htm">John 9:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>. The other meaning, stature, also occurs. Herodotus speaks of one who was of the same height (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;) with another (3:16). But both the usage and the connection are in favor of the meaning age. A measure of time is sometimes represented by a measure of length, as in <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>; but, most of all, the addition of a cubit (a foot and a half) to one's stature would not be a small one, as the text implies (that which is least), but a very large one. Moreover, Christ is speaking of food and clothing, the object of which is to foster and prolong life. Rev., age, in margin. </body></html>
