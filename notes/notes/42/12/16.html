To illustrate his admonition, and give it the greater weight, our Lord here delivers an important parable. <span class="ital">The ground of a rich man brought forth plentifully </span>— This man, it appears, became rich, not by unjust gains, but by the produce of his own land, the most innocent method possible of making or increasing an estate. Nor did his covetousness consist in heaping up wealth without end, even by a method so innocent as that of agriculture: no; the extraordinary fruitfulness of one year’s crop contented him, for it was so great that he had no further care, but to contrive how to <span class="ital">bestow his fruits. </span>And the result of his deliberation was, to <span class="ital">pull down his barns and build greater. </span>Nor did his covetousness consist in hoarding up the fruits of that one bountiful year; for he laid them up with no other intention, but to take the full use of them in every sensual enjoyment which they could afford; saying to his soul, that is, to himself, with complacency and confidence, <span class="ital">Thou hast much goods laid up for many </span>future <span class="ital">years, take thine ease — </span>Cease from the fatigue of business, and even from the labour of thought. Enjoy thyself; <span class="ital">eat </span>and <span class="ital">drink </span>without any fear of exhausting thy stores, and <span class="ital">be </span>as <span class="ital">merry </span>as corn, and wine, and oil, shared with thy most jovial companions, can make thee. This man’s covetousness, therefore, consisted in the satisfaction which he took in his goods and fruits, in his putting a high value on the pleasures of luxury which they afforded, and in proposing to derive his happiness from them alone, without taking God and religion into his scheme at all. <span class="ital">But God said unto him </span>— God, who in this man’s scheme of happiness was overlooked, thought fit to show him the folly he was guilty of in contemning his Maker, on whom he depended for every thing, and by whose providence alone he lived to enjoy any blessing: God, with just displeasure, <span class="ital">said to him, </span>by the awful dispensation of his providence, amidst all his gayety of heart, and in the variety of his schemes and hopes, <span class="ital">Thou fool </span>— Who dost thus stupidly forget both the dignity and the mortality of thy nature, and thy continual dependance upon thy supreme Lord! Know, to thy terror, that <span class="ital">this </span>very <span class="ital">night </span>— While thou art talking of a long succession of pleasurable years; <span class="ital">thy soul shall be required of thee </span>— And hurried away to its own place; that soul, which thou just now saidst had much goods laid up for many years, and which thou badest take its ease and be merry. Greek, <span class="greekheb">την ψυχην απαιτουσιν απο σου</span>, <span class="ital">They shall demand thy soul of thee; </span>that is, “Either <span class="ital">thy soul shall be required of thee by God </span>that gave it, and whose deposite it is, as the Jews speak, or else it shall be required by evil angels, according to that other opinion of the Jews, that the souls of the just, when they die, are carried into the garden of Eden by the ministry of holy angels, and the souls of the wicked to the place appointed them, by evil spirits.” — Whitby. <span class="ital">Then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided </span>— Will they be thine any longer? When thou appearest at my bar to answer for thy actions, will they buy thee off from punishment? And when thou goest to thy own place, will they procure thee one moment’s respite from thy torment, or any comfort under it?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:13-21 Christ's kingdom is spiritual, and not of this world. Christianity does not meddle with politics; it obliges all to do justly, but wordly dominion is not founded in grace. It does not encourage expectations of worldly advantages by religion. The rewards of Christ's disciples are of another nature. Covetousness is a sin we need constantly to be warned against; for happiness and comfort do not depend on the wealth of this world. The things of the world will not satisfy the desires of a soul. Here is a parable, which shows the folly of carnal worldling while they live, and their misery when they die. The character drawn is exactly that of a prudent, worldly man, who has no grateful regard to the providence of God, nor any right thought of the uncertainty of human affairs, the worth of his soul, or the importance of eternity. How many, even among professed Christians, point out similar characters as models for imitation, and proper persons to form connexions with! We mistake if we think that thoughts are hid, and thoughts are free. When he saw a great crop upon his ground, instead of thanking God for it, or rejoicing to be able to do more good, he afflicts himself. What shall I do now? The poorest beggar in the country could not have said a more anxious word. The more men have, the more perplexity they have with it. It was folly for him to think of making no other use of his plenty, than to indulge the flesh and gratify the sensual appetites, without any thought of doing good to others. Carnal worldlings are fools; and the day is coming when God will call them by their own name, and they will call themselves so. The death of such persons is miserable in itself, and terrible to them. Thy soul shall be required. He is loth to part with it; but God shall require it, shall require an account of it, require it as a guilty soul to be punished without delay. It is the folly of most men, to mind and pursue that which is for the body and for time only, more than that for the soul and eternity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A parable - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a>.<p>Plentifully - His land was fertile, and produced even beyond his expectations, and beyond what he had provided for. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-19. a certain rich man, &c.&#8212;Why is this man called a "fool?" (Lu 12:20) (1) Because he deemed a life of secure and abundant earthly enjoyment the summit of human felicity. (2) Because, possessing the means of this, through prosperity in his calling, he flattered himself that he had a long lease of such enjoyment, and nothing to do but give himself up to it. Nothing else is laid to his charge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 16-21. The evangelist lets us know, that these verses contain not a narrative of a matter of fact, but only a representation of something that is too ordinary, by a fictitious story. The scope of it is to justify what our Saviour had said in the verse immediately preceding, that a man’s life lieth not in the abundance of what he possesseth; for he who hath the greatest possessions may die as soon as he who hath not where to lay down his head, and may be taken away at a time when he is enjoying the fullest satisfactions that he can promise himself, or the creature can afford him. Therefore he acts not like a wise and rational man, that takes care to lay up for himself treasure on earth, and in the mean time neglects the riches of grace. The sense of the parable is to be learned from the epi parabolh, which we have <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/12-21.htm" title="So is he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.">Luke 12:21</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So is he that layeth up treasure for himself; </span> so foolish and unwise is he, &c. But from this parable we may make general observations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That God maketh his sun to shine and his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust. Men may have laid up much earthly treasure, who are yet very poor towards God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That the increase of riches increaseth care. The rich man saith, <span class="ital">What shall I do?</span> The difference between the beggar and the rich man is but this: both are saying, "What shall I do?" The beggar saith, "What shall I do to get money?" The other saith, "What shall I do with it now I have it?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Worldly men’s fruits are their goods, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/12-3.htm" title="Therefore whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which you have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the housetops.">Luke 12:3</a></span>; they are so in their estimation, and they are so as they are the whole portion that such should have from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Great estates and enjoyments of this life have a very enticing quality in them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a) They make us loath to die, and willing to think we shall live many years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) They entice us to a spiritual sloth and security, and to sing a requiem to our souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>c) They entice us to sinful mirth and luxury; <span class="ital">Eat, drink, and be merry</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. He that hath most may have his soul taken from him in a night. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. A man is no longer owner of the goods of this life, than he can keep an earthly possession of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7. When he dies, he knoweth not whose those things shall be; not whether his son or strangers shall inherit them; nor, if his son doth happen to meet with the countenance of the law, doth he know whether that son shall be a wise man or a fool. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>8. Hence it appears to be the most egregious folly imaginable, for men to spend their time and strength in getting and laying up treasure upon earth, in the mean time neglecting, or not duly endeavouring, to be rich towards God; both: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a) In that grace by which the soul is justified and accepted; and also, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) In that grace in the exercise of which alone he may glorify God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This latter is that which the apostle calls, a being <span class="ital">rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, </span>& c., <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/6-18.htm" title="That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;">1 Timothy 6:18</a></span>; where he mentions only one species of good works. For whereas wisdom lies in the choice of the best end, and then of the best means to obtain it, and the best circumstances in the use of those means, the worldly man failing in the first, not choosing the best end, must needs be a spiritual fool. And indeed, of all folly that is the greatest which is seen in the choice of a worse and more ignoble end, before that which is of more advantage, more noble, and excellent; as certainly the acquiring of an eternal happiness and felicity is before an acquiring a mere transitory and uncertain felicity and satisfaction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he spake a parable unto them, saying,....
