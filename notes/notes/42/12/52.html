No one is left so ignorant as not to know many things to be wrong which he does, and many things to be right which he neglects; therefore all are without excuse in their sin. The bringing in the gospel dispensation would occasion desolations. Not that this would be the tendency of Christ's religion, which is pure, peaceable, and loving; but the effect of its being contrary to men's pride and lusts. There was to be a wide publication of the gospel. But before that took place, Christ had a baptism to be baptized with, far different from that of water and the Holy Spirit. He must endure sufferings and death. It agreed not with his plan to preach the gospel more widely, till this baptism was completed. We should be zealous in making known the truth, for though divisions will be stirred up, and a man's own household may be his foes, yet sinners will be converted, and God will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>51. peace &#8230; ? Nay, &c.&#8212;the reverse of peace, in the first instance. (See on [1652]Mt 10:34-36.) The connection of all this with the foregoing warnings about hypocrisy, covetousness, and watchfulness, is deeply solemn: "My conflict hasten apace; Mine over, yours begins; and then, let the servants tread in their Master's steps, uttering their testimony entire and fearless, neither loving nor dreading the world, anticipating awful wrenches of the dearest ties in life, but looking forward, as I do, to the completion of their testimony, when, reaching the haven after the tempest, they shall enter into the joy of their Lord."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/12-51.htm" title="Suppose you that I am come to give peace on earth?
