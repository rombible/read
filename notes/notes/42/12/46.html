No one is left so ignorant as not to know many things to be wrong which he does, and many things to be right which he neglects; therefore all are without excuse in their sin. The bringing in the gospel dispensation would occasion desolations. Not that this would be the tendency of Christ's religion, which is pure, peaceable, and loving; but the effect of its being contrary to men's pride and lusts. There was to be a wide publication of the gospel. But before that took place, Christ had a baptism to be baptized with, far different from that of water and the Holy Spirit. He must endure sufferings and death. It agreed not with his plan to preach the gospel more widely, till this baptism was completed. We should be zealous in making known the truth, for though divisions will be stirred up, and a man's own household may be his foes, yet sinners will be converted, and God will be glorified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-51</a>.<p>Second watch - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46. cut him in sunder&#8212;a punishment not unknown in the East; compare Heb 11:37, "sawn asunder" (1Sa 15:33; Da 2:5).<p>the unbelievers&#8212;the unfaithful, those unworthy of trust (Mt 24:51), "the hypocrites," falsely calling themselves "servants."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "Luk 14:42"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him,....
