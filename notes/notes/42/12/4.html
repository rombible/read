Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall be proclaimed upon the housetops - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>. The custom of making proclamation from the tops or roofs of houses still prevails in the East. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 51, 52) says: "At the present day, local governors in country districts cause their commands thus to be published. Their proclamations are generally made in the evening, after the people have returned from their labors in the field. The public crier ascends the highest roof at hand, and lifts up his voice in a long-drawn call upon all faithful subjects to give ear and obey. He then proceeds to announce, in a set form, the will of their master, and demand obedience thereto." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

Here are two arguments in this verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

That there are punishments beyond this life; all men’s punishments will not end with the killing of their bodies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That men have souls as well as bodies, and both souls and bodies of sinners will in the resurrection be made capable of eternal punishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That the ready way to bring us under that misery, is to be more afraid of the wrath of men than of the wrath of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I say unto you, my friends,....

The triumphant success of the great Christian preachers and the discredited condition of the old rabbinic schools is testified to by snell words as we find in St. Paul's letters. "Where is the wise? where is the scribe?" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>). But this success the Master well knew would be accompanied with many a suffering on the part of the heralds of his message. Persecution in its many dreary forms would dog their footsteps; a death of agony and shame not unfrequently would be their guerdon. It was, for instance, we know, the earthly recognition of that devoted servant of the Lord (Paul) who, we believe, guided the pen of Luke here. This painful way, which his disciples must surely tread, had already been indicated in no obscure language by the Master ("<span class="accented">some</span> of them" - my apostles - "they shall slay and persecute," <a href="/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>). A triumph, greater than any which had ever been given to the sons of men, would surely be theirs, but the Master would not conceal the <span class="accented">earthly</span> price which his chosen servants must pay for this splendid success. There was a point,  however, beyond which human malice and enmity were utterly powerless; he would have his servants turn their thoughts on that serene region where men as men would have no power. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Unto you, my friends (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>See on Pharisees and lawyers, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/11-43.htm">Luke 11:43</a>, <a href="/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>.
