The warnings against anxiety are another application of the prohibition of laying up treasure for self. Torturing care is the poor man’s form of worldliness, as luxurious self-indulgence is the rich man’s. There are two kinds of gout, as doctors tell us-one from high living, and one from poverty of blood. This passage falls into two parts-the prohibition against anxious care {<a href="/luke/12-22.htm" title="And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat; neither for the body, what you shall put on.">Luke 12:22</a> - <a href="/luke/12-31.htm" title="But rather seek you the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.">Luke 12:31</a>}, and the exhortation to set the affections on the true treasure {<a href="/luke/12-31.htm" title="But rather seek you the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.">Luke 12:31</a> - <a href="/luke/12-34.htm" title="For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.">Luke 12:34</a>}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The first part gives the condemnation of anxiety about earthly necessities. </span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The precept is first stated generally, and then followed by a series of reasons enforcing it. As to the precept, we may remark that the disciples were mostly poor men, who might think that they were in no danger of the folly branded in the parable. They had no barns bursting with plenty, and their concern was how to find food and clothing, not what to do with superfluities. Christ would have them see that the same temper may be in them, though it takes a different shape. Dives and Lazarus may be precisely alike.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The temper condemned here is ‘self-consuming care,’ the opposite of trust. Its misery is forcibly expressed by the original meaning of the Greek word, which implies being torn in pieces, and thus paints the distraction and self-inflicted harrassment which are the lot of the anxious mind. Prudent foresight and strenuous work are equally outside this prohibition. Anxiety is so little akin to foresight that it disables from exercising it, and both hinders from seeing what to do to provide daily bread, and from doing it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The disciples’ danger of being thus anxious may be measured by the number and variety of reasons against it given by Jesus. The first of these is that such anxiety does not go deep enough, and forgets how we come to have lives to be fed and bodies to be clothed. We have received the greater, life and body, without our anxiety. The rich fool could keep his goods, but not his ‘soul’ or ‘life.’ How superficial, then, after all, our anxieties are, when God may end life at any moment! Further, since the greater is given, the less which it needs will also be given. The thought of God as ‘a faithful creator’ is implied. We must trust Him for the ‘more’; we may trust Him for the less.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second reason bids us look with attention at examples of unanxious lives abundantly fed. Perhaps Elijah’s feathered providers, or the words of the Psalmist {<a href="/psalms/147-9.htm" title="He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.">Psalm 147:9</a>}, were in Christ’s mind. The raven was one of the ‘unclean’ birds, and of ill omen, from Noah’s days, and yet had its meat in due season, though that meat was corpses. Notice the allusions to the preceding parable in ‘sow not, neither reap,’ and in ‘neither have storehouse nor barn.’ In these particulars the birds are inferior to us, and, so to speak, the harder to care for. If they who neither work nor store still get their living, shall not we, who can do both? Our superior value is in part expressed by the capacity to sow and reap; and these are more wholesome occupations for a man than worrying.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How lovingly Jesus looked on all creatures, and how clearly He saw everywhere God’s hand at work! As Luther said, ‘God spends every year in feeding sparrows more than the revenues of the King of France.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The third reason is the impotence of anxiety {<a href="/luke/12-25.htm" title="And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?">Luke 12:25</a>}. It is difficult to decide between the two possible renderings here. That of ‘a cubit’ to the ‘stature’ corresponds best with the growth of the lilies, while ‘age’ preserves an allusion to the rich fool, and avoids treating the addition of a foot and a half to an ordinary man’s height as a small thing. But age is not measured by cubits, and it is best to keep to ‘stature.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> At first sight, the argument of <a href="/luke/12-23.htm" title="The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.">Luke 12:23</a> seems to be now inverted, and what was ‘more’ to be now ‘least.’ But the supposed addition, if possible, would be of the smallest importance as regards ensuring food or clothing, and measured by the divine power required to effect it, is less than the continual providing which God does. That smaller work of His, no anxiety will enable us to do. How much less can we effect the complicated and wide-reaching arrangements needed to feed and clothe ourselves! Anxiety is impotent. It only works on our own minds, racking them in vain, but has no effect on the material world, not even on our own bodies, still less on the universe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The fourth reason bids us look with attention at examples of unanxious existence clothed with beauty. Christ here teaches the highest use of nature, and the noblest way of looking at it. The scientific botanist considers how the lilies grow, and can tell all about cells and chlorophyll and the like. The poet is in raptures with their beauty. Both teach us much, but the religious way of looking at nature includes and transcends both the others. Nature is a parable. It is a visible manifestation of God, and His ways there shadow His ways with us, and are lessons in trust.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The glorious colours of the lily come from no dyer’s vats, nor the marvellous texture of their petals from any loom. They are inferior to us in that they do not toil or spin, and in their short blossoming time. Man’s ‘days are as grass; as a flower of the field so he flourisheth’; but his date is longer, and therefore he has a larger claim on God. ‘God clothes the grass of the field’ is a truth quite independent of scientific truths or hypotheses about how He does it. If the colours of flowers depend on the visits of insects, God established the dependence, and is the real cause of the resulting loveliness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The most modern theories of the evolutionist do not in the least diminish the force of Christ’s appeal to creation’s witness to a loving Care in the heavens. But that appeal teaches us that we miss the best and plainest lesson of nature, unless we see God present and working in it all, and are thereby heartened to trust quietly in His care for us, who are better than the ravens because we have to sow and reap, or than the lilies because we must toil and spin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="/luke/12-29.htm" title="And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, neither be you of doubtful mind.">Luke 12:29</a> adds to the reference to clothing a repeated prohibition as to the other half of our anxieties, and thus rounds off the whole with the same double warning as in verse 22. But it gives a striking metaphor in the new command against ‘being of doubtful mind.’ The word so rendered means to be lifted on high, and thence to be tossed from height to depth, as a ship in a storm. So it paints the wretchedness of anxiety as ever shuttlecocked about between hopes and fears, sometimes up on the crest of a vain dream of good, sometimes down in the trough of an imaginary evil. We are sure to be thus the sport of our own fancies, unless we have our minds fixed on God in quiet trust, and therefore stable and restful.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="/luke/12-30.htm" title="For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knows that you have need of these things.">Luke 12:30</a> gives yet another reason against not only anxiety, but against that eager desire after outward things which is the parent of anxiety. If we ‘seek after’ them, we shall not be able to avoid being anxious and of doubtful mind. Such seeking, says Christ, is pure heathenism. The nations of the world who know not God make these their chief good, and securing them the aim of their lives. If we do the like, we drop to their level. What is the difference between a heathen and a Christian, if the Christian has the same objects and treasures as the heathen? That is a question which a good many so-called Christians at present would find it hard to answer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the crowning reason of all is kept for the last. Much of what precedes might be spoken by a man who had but the coldest belief in Providence. But the great and blessed faith in our Father, God, scatters all anxious care. How should we be anxious if we know that we have a Father in heaven, and that He knows our needs? He recognises our claims on Him. He made the needs, and will send the supply. That is a wide truth, stretching far beyond the mere earthly wants of food and raiment. My wants, so far as God has made me to feel them, are prophecies of God’s gifts. He has made them as doors by which He will come in and bless me. How, then, can anxious care fret the heart which feels the Father’s presence, and knows that its emptiness is the occasion for the gift of a divine fullness? Trust is the only reasonable temper for a child of such a father. Anxious care is a denial of His love or knowledge or power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. <a href="/luke/12-31.htm" title="But rather seek you the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.">Luke 12:31</a> - <a href="/luke/12-34.htm" title="For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.">Luke 12:34</a> point out the true direction of effort and affection, and the true way of using outward good so as to secure the higher riches. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is useless to tell men not to set their longings or efforts on worldly things unless you tell them of something better. Life must have some aim, and the mind must turn to something as supremely good. The only way to drive out heathenish seeking after perishable good is to fill the heart with the love and longing for eternal and spiritual good. The ejected demon comes back with a troop at his heels unless his house be filled. To seek ‘the kingdom,’ to count it our highest good to have our wills and whole being bowed in submission to the loving will of God, to labour after entire conformity to it, to postpone all earthly delights to that, and to count them all but loss if we may win it-this is the true way to conquer worldly anxieties, and is the only course of life which will not at last earn the stern judgment, ‘Thou fool.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That direction of all our desires and energies to the attainment of the kingdom which is the state of being ruled by the will of God, is to be accompanied with joyous, brave confidence. How should they fear whose desires and efforts run parallel with the ‘Father’s good pleasure’? They are seeking as their chief good what He desires, as His chief delight, to give them. Then they may be sure that, if He gives that, He will not withhold less gifts than may be needed. He will not ‘spoil the ship for a ha’p’orth of tar,’ nor allow His children, whom He has made heirs of a kingdom, to starve on their road to their crown. If they can trust Him to give them the kingdom, they may surely trust Him for bread and clothes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Mark, too, the tenderness of that ‘little flock.’ They might fear when they contrasted their numbers with the crowds of worldly men; but, being a flock, they have a shepherd, and that is enough to quiet anxiety.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Seeking and courage are to be crowned by surrender of outward good and the use of earthly wealth in such manner as that it will secure an unfailing treasure in heaven. The manner of obeying this command varies with circumstances. For some the literal fulfilment is best; and there are more Christian men to-day whose souls would be delivered from the snares if they would part with their possessions than we are willing to believe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sometimes the surrender is rather to be effected by the conscientious consecration and prayerful use of wealth. That is for each man to settle for himself. But what is not variable is the obligation to set the kingdom high above all else, and to use all outward wealth, as Christ’s servants, not for luxury and self-gratification, but as in His sight and for His glory. Let us not be afraid of believing what Jesus and His Apostles plainly teach, that wealth so spent here is treasured in heaven, and that a Christian’s place in the future life depends upon this among other conditions-how he used his money here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/12-22.htm" title="And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat; neither for the body, what you shall put on....">Luke 12:22-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he said unto his disciples — </span>Having delivered the preceding instructive and awakening parable, whereby he intended to caution the contending brothers and the multitude against covetousness, sensuality, and the love of pleasure, he now proceeds to address his disciples, and caution them against those anxious cares and earthly affections which are also very inimical to religious dispositions, and obstructive to all progress in the divine life. This part of his discourse he grounds on, and enforces by, the consideration of God’s superintending providence, and on the caution and parable which he had just delivered. As if he had said, Since a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things he possesseth; since plenty of goods and fruits is not capable of prolonging it one moment beyond the term fixed for it by God; ye, my disciples, more especially ought, for that reason, to take <span class="ital">no thought, </span>or rather, as <span class="greekheb">μεριμνατε </span>means, <span class="ital">not be solicitous </span>for the prolongation of your lives, by anxiously laying up a store of provisions and clothes, &c., as if these could preserve life; no, you should consider that <span class="ital">the life is more than meat, </span>&c. See the contents of these verses explained at large in the notes on <a href="/context/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?...">Matthew 6:25-34</a>. For Luke has here, as in other places, recapitulated several precepts given by our Lord to his followers, according to St. Matthew, at a very different time. Some commentators, indeed, have laboured to show that both evangelists refer to the same period, but certainly they have not been able to prove that point: and to attempt it was perfectly unnecessary, it being surely proper that our Lord should repeat to his hearers in Judea, who had hitherto not been favoured with his public ministry, the doctrines which he had before delivered to such as attended his discourses in Galilee. <span class="ital">Neither be ye of a doubtful mind</span> — <span class="greekheb">Μη μετεωριζεσθε</span>. Be not (like meteors in the air, tossed about by every wind) of a fluctuating, unstable mind or judgment, agitated with a variety of restless, uneasy thoughts. Any speculations and musings in which the mind is suspended in an uneasy hesitation, might well be expressed by the word. The thing forbidden, says Theophylact, is <span class="greekheb">περισπασμος και του λογου αστατος περιφορα</span>, a distracting and unstable fluctuation of the mind, or reason, about provision for the body, which Christ would here remove from the children of God, assuring them that his wisdom knows what is needful for them, (<a href="/luke/12-30.htm" title="For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knows that you have need of these things.">Luke 12:30</a>,) and that his fatherly care will certainly provide for them what is so.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:22-40 Christ largely insisted upon this caution not to give way to disquieting, perplexing cares, Mt 6:25-34. The arguments here used are for our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right way to get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom to take it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ. Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts of evil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. If we value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries of life. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only working servants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for their lord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him. In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming to call his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. We are uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should therefore be always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thus wise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the good man of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief would come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-31.

Jesus now turns from the people (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm" title="And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:">Luke 12:16</a>) again to His disciples.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>] because this is the state of things with the <span class="greekheb">θησαυρίζων ἑαυτῷ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μὴ εἰς θεὸν πλουτῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/luke/12-24.htm" title="Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are you better than the fowls?">Luke 12:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοὺς κόρακας</span>] not in reference to the <span class="ital">young ravens</span> forsaken by the old ones (<a href="/job/38-41.htm" title="Who provides for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for lack of meat.">Job 38:41</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-9.htm" title="He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.">Psalm 147:9</a>); but a <span class="ital">common and very numerous</span> species of bird is mentioned (the <span class="ital">pulli</span> corvorum must otherwise have been expressly named: in opposition to Grotius and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/luke/12-28.htm" title="If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?">Luke 12:28</a>. According to the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> (but see the critical remarks), <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ</span> would have to be connected with <span class="greekheb">ὄντα</span>; on the other hand, following the reading of the amended texts: <span class="ital">but if in the field God in such wise clothes the grass, which to-day is here and to-morrow is cast into an oven</span>, etc. Instead of <span class="greekheb">ἀμφιέννυσι</span>, we must read, with Lachmann, <span class="greekheb">ἀμφιάζει</span>, or, with Tischendorf, <span class="greekheb">ἀμφιέζει</span>.

The <span class="ital">usus loguendi</span> of <span class="greekheb">μετεωρίζεσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">efferri</span>, physically and (Aristoph. <span class="ital">Av</span>. 1447; Polyb. iii. 70. 1, iv. 59. 4, vii. 4. 6; Diodor. xi. 32. 41) psychically is well known. See also the passages from Philo in Loesner, p. 116. But others (Castalio, Beza, Grotius, Maldonatus, Hammond, Wolf, Bengel, Krebs, Valckenaer, Rosenmüller, Kuinoel, Paulus, Bleek, and many more) have: <span class="ital">nec inter spem metumque fluctuetis</span>. Comp. Ewald: “waver not, lose not your balance.” The view of Euthymius Zigabenus also is that Christ refers to <span class="greekheb">τὸν περισπασμὸν τὸν ἀπὸ τῶν οὐρανίων ἐπὶ τὰ γήϊνα</span>. Certainly, as <span class="greekheb">μετέωρος</span> may mean: <span class="ital">fluctuans</span> (see Schweighäuser, <span class="ital">Lex. Pol</span>. p. 387; Josephus, <span class="ital">Antt</span>. iv. 3. 1, <span class="ital">Bell</span>. iv. 2. 5), <span class="greekheb">μετεωρίζειν</span> may signify: <span class="ital">to make wavering</span> (Dem. 169. 23; Polyb. v. 70. 10; <span class="ital">Schol. ad Soph.

"What ye shall eat." How repeatedly in the Master's sermons do we find the reminder against the being careful about eating! We know from pagan writers in this age how gluttony, in its coarser and more refined forms, was among the more notorious evils of Roman society in Italy and in the provinces.
