The sparrow was of so little value that the odd bird was thrown in to tempt the purchasers. Both this difference, and that between “not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father,” in St. Matthew, and “not one of them is forgotten before God,” in St. Luke, are proofs, again, of the independence of the two Gospels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/12-6.htm" title="Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?...">Luke 12:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ασσαριων δυο</span>, <span class="ital">two pence, </span>as Dr. Campbell translates it, or “three half-pence sterling;” <span class="ital">and not one of them is forgotten before God </span>— As if he had said, But trust in as well as fear him, for remember, he is an infinitely more kind, as well as more powerful friend than man, and all things are in his hand and keeping.

Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall be proclaimed upon the housetops - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>. The custom of making proclamation from the tops or roofs of houses still prevails in the East. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 51, 52) says: "At the present day, local governors in country districts cause their commands thus to be published. Their proclamations are generally made in the evening, after the people have returned from their labors in the field. The public crier ascends the highest roof at hand, and lifts up his voice in a long-drawn call upon all faithful subjects to give ear and obey. He then proceeds to announce, in a set form, the will of their master, and demand obedience thereto." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. five &#8230; for two farthings&#8212;In Mt 10:29 it is "two for one farthing"; so if one took two farthings' worth, he got one in addition&#8212;of such small value were they.<p>than many sparrows&#8212;not "than millions of sparrows"; the charm and power of our Lord's teaching is very much in this simplicity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 6,7. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm" title="Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.">Matthew 10:29</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/10-31.htm" title="Fear you not therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows.">Matthew 10:31</a></span>. Our Saviour’s third argument is brought from the providence of God, both his general providence, upholding the beings of all his creatures, so that he forgetteth not a sparrow, though a creature of so minute a value, that <span class="ital">two</span> of them <span class="ital">are sold for a farthing, </span> as Matthew saith, or <span class="ital">five for two farthings, </span> as Luke saith; yea, he so remembereth them, that one of them falls not to the ground without his knowledge and leave, saith Matthew.

As two were sold for one farthing; see Gill on <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>; so in buying and selling, where more money is laid out, things are bought cheaper; the Persic version reads, "for two barley corns": <p>and not one of them is forgotten before God; a single sparrow, a bird of little value and worth, is taken notice and care of by him; it has its life from him, and is provided for with food by him, and is under his protection; nor does he ever forget it, nor can any thing be done to it, without his permission; it cannot be struck, so as to cause it to fall on the ground, or be taken in a snare, or be killed in any shape, without the knowledge of God: his providence reaches to the minutest creatures and things, and much more then to rational creatures, to men; and still more to his dear children, ministers, and apostles. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/12-6.htm" title="Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?">Luke 12:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">πέντε</span>, five, for two farthings, two for one in Mt.

Though persecution and bitter suffering, even death, may be the guerdon of the Lord's true servants here, none of these things can happen without the consent of God. This thought will surely give them courage to endure. Suffering undergone in God's service, inflicted, too, with his entire consent, so that the suffering becomes part of the service, - what an onlook is afforded to the brave, faithful servant by such a contemplation! Oh the welcome from God he is sure to meet with when such a death has been endured! These extreme instances of God's universal care - his all-knowledge of everything, however little and insignificant, belonging to his creatures - are chosen to give point to the Master's words. If he knows of the death of these little, almost valueless, birds - ay, even of the falling of one of the many hairs of your head - surely you cannot doubt his knowledge of, his caring for, the life or death of one of his proved and gallant followers. These little sparrows were sold in the markets, strung together, or on skewers. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Sparrows<p>See on <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>.<p>Fall<p>See on <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>. </body></html>
