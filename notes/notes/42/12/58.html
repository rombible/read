There is, indeed, something at first strangely abrupt in this reproduction of what had appeared in the Sermon on the Mount as part of our Lord’s teaching as to the true meaning of the command “Thou shalt not kill.” (See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.">Matthew 5:25</a>.) There the words are spoken at once of earthly adversaries and magistrates and of the great Judge of all. Is it so in this place also? Is this the “just judgment” to which <a href="/luke/12-57.htm" title="Yes, and why even of yourselves judge you not what is right?">Luke 12:57</a> referred, in contrast with the prevailing bitterness and hardness of men in the quarrels brought on chiefly by their greed of gain? The answer to the question is found in accepting, as before, both the literal meaning and that of which it becomes a parable, with, perhaps, a greater stress than before on the spiritual aspect of the words. Our Lord is speaking to the people; there has been no immediate reference, as before, to the Sixth Commandment. His teaching has taken a wider range, and the old words, as it were, come back, with every point of the parable brought into full clearness. The “adversary” is the Law that accuses them (<a href="/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>); the judge is none other than the Judge of all the earth; and then all follows in due order as before.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/12-58.htm" title="When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, as you are in the way, give diligence that you may be delivered from him; lest he hale you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into prison....">Luke 12:58-59</a></span>. <span class="ital">When thou goest with thine adversary, </span>&c. — The evils which befall obstinate sinners, he here illustrates by the punishment which, in ordinary cases, is inflicted upon the man who obstinately refuses to make compensation for the injuries he has done; but, even while his adversary is haling him to the judge, he will not agree the matter with him. He is therefore brought by force to the bar. The judge condemns him. The officer seizes him. He is cast into prison, and lies there till he has paid the very last mite. See on <a href="/context/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison....">Matthew 5:25-26</a>. Thus, as if Christ had said, If you persist to be regardless of the proposals of God’s mercy while the day of life and grace continues, nothing is to be expected from the tribunal of his justice but a severe sentence, which will end in everlasting confinement and punishment. Reader, may we learn from these warnings of our Lord to be so wise at all times as to discern the evidences, and comply with the purposes, of the gospel; otherwise our knowledge in natural things, should it extend not only to the most common, but to the most curious appearances on the face of the earth or the heavens, will turn to no other account but to shame and condemn us. And if we have any reasons to fear that through our impenitence, the blessed God is still an adversary to us, let us make it our first care, by an humble submission of soul to him, and obedient faith in Christ and his gospel, to seek that reconciliation with him which will prevent that strict scrutiny of his justice, and that sentence of his wrath, which would otherwise plunge us into endless ruin and misery; for when could we pretend to have paid the <span class="ital">last farthing </span>of this debt of <span class="ital">ten thousand talents </span>which we have been daily contracting, and which is charged to our account in the book of his remembrance? <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:54-59 Christ would have the people to be as wise in the concerns of their souls as they are in outward affairs. Let them hasten to obtain peace with God before it is too late. If any man has found that God has set himself against him concerning his sins, let him apply to him as God in Christ reconciling the world to himself.

It is implied that if they had the necessary moral discernment they would see that a judgment day was at hand, and understand that the duty of the hour was to come to terms with their adversary by timely repentance.

If you had wronged a man it would be obviously wise to avert the consequences of your wrongdoing before it became too late. Even so must you act towards God. To press the <span class="ital">details</span> is obviously false theology. “Theologia parabolica non est argumentativa.” Here again St Matthew quotes the parable in a slightly different connexion (<a href="/context/luke/5-25.htm" title="And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that where on he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God....">Luke 5:25-26</a>) to teach that love and forgiveness to man are an indispensable condition of forgiveness from God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">give diligence</span>] A curious Latinism, <span class="ital">da operam.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>to the officer</span>] i.e. the jailor, literally the <span class="ital">exactor</span> (<span class="greekheb">πράκτορι</span>). “God is here shadowed forth as at once the adversary, the judge, and the officer; the first by His holiness, the second by His justice, the third by His power.” Godet.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 58, 59.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite</span>. And then the Master passed into one of those parable illustrations with which his hearers were now familiar, and which in a homely way taught the crowd the same grave truth which he had been dwelling upon - the impending terrible judgment which was coming on the people. The lesson, "be reconciled to God while it is yet time," is, of course, <span class="accented">applicable</span> to all lives, precarious and hanging seemingly on a thread as they all are, but it was especially spoken to that generation in view of the awful ruin which he knew was so soon to fall on every Jewish home. The genera] meaning of the parable illustration was obvious; no hearer could fail to understand the Lord's meaning. It is <span class="accented">before</span> arriving at the judgment-seat that you must be reconciled, with the one who accuses you, otherwise it will be too late, and nothing would remain for the guilty accused but the eternal prison-house. At <span class="accented">that</span> moment, when the Master was speaking, individual or nation might have turned to the Lord and lived. There was no time, however, for hesitation. The sands in the hour-glass, which marked the duration of God's longsuffering with Israel, were just running out.   Theologians in different ages and of varied schools have made much of the concluding sentence (ver. 59). Roman Catholic divines see in it a strong argument in favor of the doctrine of purgatory, arguing that after death condemnation would be followed by liberation, when a certain payment had been made by the guilty soul; strange ways of paying this debt by means of others we know have been devised by the school of divines who teach this doctrine of purgatory. But the Lord's words here are terribly plain, and utterly exclude any payment of the debt of the soul <span class="accented">by others.</span> The Master emphatically says, "till <span class="accented">thou</span> hast paid the very last mite." The advocate who pleads for universal redemption, and shrinks from a punishment to the duration of which he can see no term, thinks that in the words, "till thou hast paid," he can discern the germ at least of eternal hope. But the impenetrable veil which hangs between us and the endless hereafter prevents us, surely, from even suggesting that any suffering which the soul may endure in the unseen world will ever pay "the <span class="accented">very last mite</span>," and so lead to pardon and peace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>When thou goest (&#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>The A.
