Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall be proclaimed upon the housetops - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>. The custom of making proclamation from the tops or roofs of houses still prevails in the East. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 51, 52) says: "At the present day, local governors in country districts cause their commands thus to be published. Their proclamations are generally made in the evening, after the people have returned from their labors in the field. The public crier ascends the highest roof at hand, and lifts up his voice in a long-drawn call upon all faithful subjects to give ear and obey. He then proceeds to announce, in a set form, the will of their master, and demand obedience thereto." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7. five &#8230; for two farthings&#8212;In Mt 10:29 it is "two for one farthing"; so if one took two farthings' worth, he got one in addition&#8212;of such small value were they.<p>than many sparrows&#8212;not "than millions of sparrows"; the charm and power of our Lord's teaching is very much in this simplicity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/12-6.htm" title="Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?">Luke 12:6</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered,....
