(See Note on <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.">Matthew 19:21</a>.) It was clearly one of the precepts which his own characteristic tendencies led him to record (see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and which found its fulfilment in the overflowing love that showed itself in the first days of the Church of the Apostles (<a href="/acts/2-45.htm" title="And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.">Acts 2:45</a>). Subsequent experience may have modified the duty of literal obedience, but the principle implied in it, that it is wise to sit loose to earthly possessions, possessing them as though we possessed not (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-30.htm" title="And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;">1Corinthians 7:30</a>), is one which has not lost its force.<p><span class= "bld">Provide yourselves bags . . .</span>—The Greek word for <span class= "ital">bags</span> (elsewhere “purse,” <a href="/luke/22-35.htm" title="And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and money, and shoes, lacked you any thing?

Of the three words used in the New Testament for “purse” or “bag” it was the most classical.<p><span class= "bld">Where no thief approacheth.</span>—See Note on <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm" title="But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:">Matthew 6:20</a>. The form is in some respects briefer here, but “the treasure that faileth not” is a touch peculiar to St. Luke. The adjective which he uses is a rare one, and not found elsewhere in the New Testament; but one from the same root, in <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-14.htm" title="For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which they that use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts that come from learning.">Wisdom Of Solomon 7:14</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-18.htm" title="And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.">Wisdom Of Solomon 8:18</a>, describes wisdom as “a treasure that never faileth.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:22-40 Christ largely insisted upon this caution not to give way to disquieting, perplexing cares, Mt 6:25-34. The arguments here used are for our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right way to get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom to take it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ. Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts of evil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. If we value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries of life. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only working servants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for their lord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him. In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming to call his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. We are uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should therefore be always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thus wise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the good man of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief would come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sell that ye have - Sell your property.

Nevertheless spiritual prudence makes men, from being mercenary, even though they have not the most abundant supply of goods, to become liberal, and disposed to sell in order to have wherewith to give, especially when the exigency requires it. See <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm" title="Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil shall be on the earth.">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>; <a href="/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">βαλάντια</span>, <span class="ital">purses</span>) Plural. He who sells after the manner of the world, fills his <span class="ital">purse</span>: but this kind of purse <span class="ital">waxes old</span>, even as the natural <span class="ital">heaven</span> itself doth.[122]—<span class="greekheb">θησαυρὸν ἀνέκλειπτον</span>, <span class="ital">a treasure that faileth not</span>) The treasure, as opposed to the purse, is the abundance of articles of food, which are very soon spent or spoiled [consumed or corrupted].—<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>) namely [purses and a treasure] <span class="ital">in</span> the heavens. This appertains to both of the preceding clauses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[122] Opposed to the spiritual <span class="greekheb">τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span>, which do not wax old.—ED. and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wan not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not</span>. "Those of you who <span class="accented">have</span> riches, see, this is what I counsel you to do with them." In considering these much-disputed words of the Master, we must remember <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">to whom</span> they were spoken: they were addressed to men and women who, if they would follow him, <span class="accented">must</span> set themselves free from all worldly possessions; they must literally forsake <span class="accented">all</span> to follow him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We must bear in mind <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that the only community which attempted, as a community, to obey this charge <span class="accented">literally</span> was the Church of Jerusalem, and the result was that for long years this Church was plunged into the deepest poverty, so that assistance had to be sent even from far-distant Churches to this deeply impoverished Jerusalem community. [This we learn from Paul, the real compiler of this very Gospel, where the charge is reported. See many passages in his letters, notably the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, <span class="accented">passim.</span>] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The mendicant orders in the Middle <span class="accented">Ages</span>, with no little bravery and constancy, likewise attempted to carry out to the letter this direction. The impartial student of mediaeval history, while doing all justice to the aims and work of these often devoted men, can judge whether or no these mendicant orders can be reckoned among the <span class="accented">permanently</span> successful agencies of the cross. We conclude, then, that these words had a <span class="accented">literal</span> meaning only for those to whom they were specially addressed, viz. the disciples. While to the Church generally they convey this deep, far-reaching lesson, a lesson all would-be servants of Christ would do well to take to heart - it is the Master's will that his followers <span class="accented">should sit loose</span> to all <span class="accented">earthly possessions</span>, <span class="accented">possessing them as though they possessed not.</span> Thus living, the heart will be free from all inordinate care for earthly treasure, and will, in real earnest, turn to that serene region where its real and abiding riches indeed are - even to heaven. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Bags (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)<p>From &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;, to throw.
