In the form of the answer there are slight variations. The contrast between “the children of this world “or “age,” those, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> who belong to it (see Note on <a href="/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>), and those of “that world” or “age,” is peculiar to St. Luke. In both cases the word rests primarily on the idea of time rather than place. It may be noted that no other writer in the New Testament uses the form of words, “<span class= "ital">that</span> world,” the age or period that is <span class= "ital">there,</span> not <span class= "ital">here,</span> for the life of the eternal kingdom. The more common phrase is “the world to come” (<a href="/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-30.htm" title="But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.">Matthew 19:30</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:27-38 It is common for those who design to undermine any truth of God, to load it with difficulties.

In his world beyond the grave, while he tells us of a continuing existence, of varied and ever-increasing activity, in contradistinction to the Nirvana of Buddha, in these pictures of Jesus the sensual paradise of Mohammed, for instance, finds no place. Marriage is, according to our Lord's teaching, but a temporary expedient to preserve the human race, to which death would soon put an end. But in the world to come there will be no death and no marriage. We may assume from his words here that the difference between the sexes will have ceased to exist. <span class="cmt_word">They are equal unto the angels</span>. Equal with the angels in being immortal; no death; no marriage. Jesus in this place asserts that angels have a body, but are exempt from any difference of sex. The angels are here introduced because our Lord was speaking with Sadducees, who (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>) denied the existence of these glorious beings. He wished to set the seal of his teaching on the deeply interesting question of the existence of angels. </body></html>
