Munster’s note on this text shows, in a very forcible manner, the wretched expedients of some modern Jews to evade the force of that interpretation of the one hundred and tenth Psalm, which refers it to the Messiah.” — Doddridge. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:39-47 The scribes commended the reply Christ made to the Sadducees about the resurrection, but they were silenced by a question concerning the Messiah.

The scribes would receive the severest judgement for defrauding the poor widows, and for their abuse of religion, particularly of prayer, which they used as a pretence for carrying on worldly and wicked plans. Dissembled piety is double sin.

Jesus asked the Pharisees, "What think ye of Christ? whose Son is he? They say unto him, <span class="accented">The Son</span> of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord," etc.? (<a href="/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42-44</a>). This is one of the most remarkable sayings of our Lord reported by the synoptists; in it he distinctly claims for himself Divinity, <span class="accented">partiei. pation in omnipotence.</span> Unmistakably, lately, under the thinnest veil of parable, Jesus had told the people that he was Messiah For instance, his <span class="accented">words</span> in the parable of the "wicked husbandmen;" in the parable of "the pounds;" in his late acts in the temple - driving out the sellers and buyers, allowing the children in the temple to welcome him with Messianic salutation, receiving as Messiah the welcome of the Passover pilgrims and others on Palm Sunday as he entered Jerusalem. In his later <span class="accented">parables</span>, too, he had with startling clearness predicted his approaching violent death. Now, Jesus was aware that the capital charge which would be brought against him would be blasphemy, that he had called himself, not only the Messiah, but Divine, the Son of God (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>). He was desirous, then, before the end came, to show from an acknowledged Messianic psalm that if he was Messiah - and unquestionably a large proportion of the people received him as such - he was also Divine. The words of the psalm (110.) indisputably show this, viz. that the coming Messiah was Divine. This, he pointed out to them, was the old faith, the doctrine taught in their own inspired Scriptures. <span class="accented">But this was not the doctrine of the Jews in the time of our Lord. They, like the Ebionites in early Christian days, expected for their Messiah a mere</span> "beloved <span class="accented">Man."</span> It is most noticeable that the Messianic claim of Jesus, although not, of course, conceded by the scribes, was never protested against by them. <span class="accented">That</span> would have been glaringly unpopular. So many of the people, we know, were persuaded of the truth of these pretensions; Jesus had evidently the greatest difficulty to stay the people's enthusiasm in his favour. What the scribes persistently repelled, and in the end condemned him for, was <span class="accented">his assertion of Divinity.</span> In this passage he shows from their own Scriptures that whoever was Messiah <span class="accented">must be Divine.</span> He spoke over and over again as Messiah; he acted with the power and in the authority of Messiah; he allowed himself on several public occasions to be saluted as such: who would venture, then, to question that he was fully conscious of his Divinity? This conclusion is drawn, not from St. John, but exclusively from the recitals of the three synoptists. </body></html>
