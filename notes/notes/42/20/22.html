The Syriac and Persic versions here, as in the other evangelists, render it, "head money". The phrase, "for us", is here added, and on it lies the emphasis, and stress of the question; for the doubt pretended, was not whether it was lawful for the Romans to pay tribute to Caesar, but whether it was lawful for them who were Jews, were Abraham's seed, and, as they boasted, were never in bondage, but were the Lord's free people, to pay tribute to an Heathen emperor, or no. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/20-22.htm" title="Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?">Luke 20:22</a> f. <span class="ital">The question</span>.—<span class="greekheb">φόρον</span> = <span class="greekheb">κῆνσον</span>, a Latinism, in the parallels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Cesar</span>, <span class="ital">or no?</span>] The question was devised with so superlative a craft that it seemed impossible for our Lord to escape.
