How many resemble the Jews who murdered the prophets and crucified Christ, in their enmity to God, and aversion to his service, desiring to live according to their lusts, without control! Let all who are favoured with God's word, look to it that they make proper use of their advantages. Awful will be the doom, both of those who reject the Son, and of those who profess to reverence Him, yet render not the fruits in due season. Though they could not but own that for such a sin, such a punishment was just, yet they could not bear to hear of it. It is the folly of sinners, that they persevere in sinful ways, though they dread the destruction at the end of those ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-45</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-19. written&#8212;(in Ps 118:22, 23.

Yet the oracle does not directly indicate the fate of the builders, but rather the unexpected turn in the fortunes of the rejected and despised Stone. In Mt. and Mk. the citation is introduced, without any binding connection with what immediately goes before, to state a fact concerning the future of the “Son” lying outside the parable.

The stone is regarded both as a foundation-stone, and a stone at the angle of the building, binding the two walls together.

In <a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a> of our Gospel Simeon refers to the same well-known prophetic saying. The husbandmen who had just been described as vine-dressers are now described as builders, and the murdered son is reproduced under the image of a corner, stone tossed aside as useless. In the first part of the picture, the earthly humiliation of Messiah is portrayed when the stone is laid in the earth. In the second, the stone falling from the top of the building represents the crushing of all earthly opposition by Messiah in his glory.
