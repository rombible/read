To express that sense, it should have been <span class="greekheb">ην αρχομενος ειναι</span>, &c., as Epiphanius, probably by a mistake, has quoted it.” The author of the Vindication of the beginning of Matthew’s and Luke’s gospel, [with whom Dr. Campbell agrees,] extremely dissatisfied with all the common versions and explications of these words, would render them, <span class="ital">And Jesus was obedient, </span>or lived in subjection [<span class="ital">to his parents</span>] <span class="ital">about thirty years; </span>and produces several passages from approved Greek writers, in which <span class="greekheb">αρχομενος </span>signifies <span class="ital">subject. </span>But in all those places it is used in some connection or opposition, which determines the sense; and therefore none of them are instances parallel to this. Luke evidently uses <span class="greekheb">αρχομενων</span>, <a href="/luke/21-28.htm" title="And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.">Luke 21:28</a>, in the sense we suppose it to have here: and since he had before expressed our Lord’s subjection to his parents by the word <span class="greekheb">υποτασσομενος</span>, <a href="/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>, there is great reason to believe he would have used the same word here, had he intended to give us the same idea. The meaning of the evangelist, therefore, evidently is, that Jesus, having received those different testimonies from his Father, from the Spirit, and from John the Baptist, all given in presence of the multitudes assembled to John’s baptism, began his ministry when he was about thirty years old, the age at which the priests and Levites entered on their sacred ministrations in the temple. Both Jesus and John deferred entering on their public ministry till they were that age, because the Jews would not have received any doctrines from them if they had begun it sooner. Our great Master, as it seems, attained not to the conclusion of his thirty-fourth year. Yet what glorious achievements did he accomplish within those narrow limits of time! Happy that servant, who, with any proportionate zeal, despatches the business of life! And so much the more happy, if his sun go down at noon. For the space that is taken from the labours of time, shall be added to the rewards of eternity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Being </span>(as was supposed) <span class="ital">the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli </span>— That is, the son-in-law: for Eli was the father of Mary. So Matthew writes the genealogy of Joseph, descended from David by Solomon; Luke that of Mary, descended from David by Nathan. In the genealogy of Joseph (recited by Matthew) that of Mary is implied, the Jews being accustomed to marry into their own families. The genealogy inserted here by Luke will appear with a beautiful propriety, if the place which it holds in his history be attended to. “It stands immediately after Jesus is said to have received the testimony of the Spirit, declaring him the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God, </span>that is to say, <span class="ital">Messiah; </span>and before he entered on his ministry, the first act of which was, his encountering with and vanquishing the strongest temptation of the arch enemy of mankind. Christ’s genealogy by his mother, who conceived him miraculously, placed in this order, seems to insinuate that he was <span class="ital">the seed of the woman, </span>which, in the first intimation of mercy vouchsafed to mankind after the fall, was predicted to break the head of the serpent. Accordingly Luke, as became the historian who related Christ’s miraculous conception, carries his genealogy to Adam, who, together with Eve, received the fore-mentioned promise concerning the restitution of mankind by the seed of the woman.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:23-38 Matthew's list of the forefathers of Jesus showed that Christ was the son of Abraham, in whom all the families of the earth are blessed, and heir to the throne of David; but Luke shows that Jesus was the Seed of the woman that should break the serpent's head, and traces the line up to Adam, beginning with Eli, or Heli, the father, not of Joseph, but of Mary. The seeming differences between the two evangelists in these lists of names have been removed by learned men. But our salvation does not depend upon our being able to solve these difficulties, nor is the Divine authority of the Gospels at all weakened by them. The list of names ends thus, Who was the son of Adam, the son of God; that is, the offspring of God by creation. Christ was both the son of Adam and the Son of God, that he might be a proper Mediator between God and the sons of Adam, and might bring the sons of Adam to be, through him, the sons of God. All flesh, as descended from the first Adam, is as grass, and withers as the flower of the field; but he who partakes of the Holy Spirit of life from the Second Adam, has that eternal happiness, which by the gospel is preached unto us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus began to be ... - This was the age at which the priests entered on their office, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>, <a href="/numbers/4-47.htm">Numbers 4:47</a>; but it is not evident that Jesus had any reference to that in delaying his work to his thirtieth year.

Genealogy of Jesus.<p>23. he began to be about thirty&#8212;that is, "was about entering on His thirtieth year." So our translators have taken the word (and so Calvin, Beza, Bloomfield, Webster and Wilkinson, &c.): but "was about thirty years of age when He began [His ministry]," makes better Greek, and is probably the true sense [Bengel, Olshausen, De Wette, Meyer, Alford, &c.]. At this age the priests entered on their office (Nu 4:3).<p>being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, &c.&#8212;Have we in this genealogy, as well as in Matthew's, the line of Joseph? or is this the line of Mary?&#8212;a point on which there has been great difference of opinion and much acute discussion. Those who take the former opinion contend that it is the natural sense of this verse, and that no other would have been thought of but for its supposed improbability and the uncertainty which it seems to throw over our Lord's real descent. But it is liable to another difficulty; namely, that in this case Matthew makes Jacob, while Luke makes "Heli," to be Joseph's father; and though the same man had often more than one name, we ought not to resort to that supposition, in such a case as this, without necessity. And then, though the descent of Mary from David would be liable to no real doubt, even though we had no table of her line preserved to us (see, for example, Lu 1:2-32, and see on [1562]Lu 2:5), still it does seem unlikely&#8212;we say not incredible&#8212;that two genealogies of our Lord should be preserved to us, neither of which gives his real descent. Those who take the latter opinion, that we have here the line of Mary, as in Matthew that of Joseph&#8212;here His real, there His reputed line&#8212;explain the statement about Joseph, that he was "the son of Hell," to mean that he was his son-in-law, as the husband of his daughter Mary (as in Ru 1:11, 12), and believe that Joseph's name is only introduced instead of Mary's, in conformity with the Jewish custom in such tables. Perhaps this view is attended with fewest difficulties, as it certainly is the best supported. However we decide, it is a satisfaction to know that not a doubt was thrown out by the bitterest of the early enemies of Christianity as to our Lord's real descent from David. On comparing the two genealogies, it will be found that Matthew, writing more immediately for Jews, deemed it enough to show that the Saviour was sprung from Abraham and David; whereas Luke, writing more immediately for Gentiles, traces the descent back to Adam, the parent stock of the whole human family, thus showing Him to be the promised "Seed of the woman." "The possibility of constructing such a table, comprising a period of thousands of years, in an uninterrupted line from father to son, of a family that dwelt for a long time in the utmost retirement, would be inexplicable, had not the members of this line been endowed with a thread by which they could extricate themselves from the many families into which every tribe and branch was again subdivided, and thus hold fast and know the member that was destined to continue the lineage. This thread was the hope that Messiah would be born of the race of Abraham and David. The ardent desire to behold Him and be partakers of His mercy and glory suffered not the attention to be exhausted through a period embracing thousands of years. Thus the member destined to continue the lineage, whenever doubtful, became easily distinguishable, awakening the hope of a final fulfilment, and keeping it alive until it was consummated" [Olshausen].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here is amongst critics a little dispute, whether our blessed Lord at his baptism (after which he soon began his public ministry) was full <span class="ital">thirty years of age; </span> wsei and arcomenov in the Greek give occasion to the doubt. Those who judge that he was thirty complete, conceive that the age before which the priests and Levites did no service in the tabernacle of God. <span class="bld"><a href="/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a></span> commanded the number of them to be taken <span class="ital">from thirty years old to fifty, </span> and it was done accordingly, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/3-34.htm" title="Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,">Luke 3:34</a>,35</span>, &c. David, in the latter end of his life, so numbered them, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.">1 Chronicles 23:3</a></span>, when their number (of that age) was thirty-eight thousand; yet in that chapter, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_chronicles/23-24.htm" title="These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>,27</span>, we find them numbered <span class="ital">from twenty years old and upward; </span> but possibly that was for some more inferior service. In conformity to this, most think that both John the Baptist and Christ entered not upon their public ministry till they were of that age; but whether they were thirty years of age complete, or current, is a question, but so little a one, as deserves no great study to resolve: the two qualifying words, wsei and arcomenov, would incline one to think Christ was but thirty years of age current, which is advantaged by what others tell us, that the Jews ordinarily called a child two or three years old as soon as it did but enter upon its second or third year. Some think our Saviour was ten months above twenty-nine years of age when he was baptized, after which he was tempted of the devil forty days before he entered the public ministry; but these are little things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph.</span> Joseph was not his natural father, though so supposed by the Jews, Joseph being indeed his legal father, being married to the virgin when our Saviour was born, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/1-20.htm" title="But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:20</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age,.... Or Jesus, when he was baptized and began his public ministry, was about thirty years of age: an age at which the priests, under the law, who were typical of Christ, entered on their work, <a href="/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a> The word, "began", is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions: and is often indeed redundant, as in <a href="/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a> and frequently in Mark's Gospel. The Arabic version renders it, "Jesus began to enter into the thirtieth year", which carries the sense the same with our translation: <p>being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph; who had espoused Mary before she was with child of the Holy Ghost, and afterwards took her to wife, and brought up her son; so that it was not known but that he was the son of Joseph. Whether or no the Jewish notion of the Messiah, the son of Joseph (y) may not take its rise from hence, may be considered: however, Joseph might very rightly be called, as he was supposed to be, the father of Jesus, by a rule which obtains with the Jews (z) that he <p>"that brings up, and not he that begets, is called the father,'' <p>or parent; of which they give various instances (a) in Joseph, in Michal, and in Pharaoh's daughter. <p>Which was the son of Eli; meaning, not that Joseph was the son of Eli; for he was the son of Jacob, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-16.htm">Matthew 1:16</a>, but Jesus was the son of Eli; and which must be understood, and carried through the whole genealogy, as thus; Jesus the son of Matthat, Jesus the son of Levi, Jesus the son of Melchi, &amp;c. till you come to Jesus the son of Adam, and Jesus the Son of God; though it is true indeed that Joseph was the son of Eli, having married his daughter; Mary was the daughter of Eli: and so the Jews speak of one Mary, the daughter of Eli, by whom they seem to design the mother of our Lord: for they tell (b) us of one, <p>"that saw,  , "Mary the daughter of Eli" in the shades, hanging by the fibres of her breasts; and there are that say, the gate, or, as elsewhere (c), the bar of the gate of hell is fixed to her ear.'' <p>By the horrible malice, in the words, you may know who is meant: however, this we gain by it, that by their own confession, Mary is the daughter of Eli; which accords with this genealogy of the evangelist, who traces it from Mary, under her husband Joseph; though she is not mentioned, because of a rule with the Jews (d), that <p>"the family of the mother is not called a family.'' <p>(y) T.

It is true the connecting of the two participles <span class="greekheb">ἀρχόμενος ὤν</span> would not in itself be ungrammatical (see Pflugk, <span class="ital">ad Hec.</span> 358); but this way of looking at the matter is altogether wrong, because, in respect of the appearance of the <span class="ital">Messiah</span>, there could be no question of a custom at all, and the fixing of the age of the <span class="ital">Levites</span> (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-47.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:47</a>), which, moreover, was not a custom, but a <span class="ital">law</span>, has nothing to do with the appearance of a prophet, and especially of the Messiah.

Lightfoot, p. 750) to the desperate expedient of exegetically making it out to be a genealogical tree of <span class="ital">Mary</span> thus: “<span class="ital">being a son, as it was thought, of Joseph</span> (<span class="ital">but, in fact, of Mary</span>), <span class="ital">of Eli</span>,” etc. Wieseler supports his view by the fact that he reads, with Lachmann and Tischendorf, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐνομίζ</span>. <span class="ital">after</span> <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span> (B L <span class="greekheb">א</span>), and on weaker evidence reads before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἸΩΣΉΦ</span></span></span> the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ</span></span></span> which is now again deleted even by Tischendorf. But as, in respect of the received arrangement of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ἘΝΟΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, it is only the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὪΝ ΥἹῸς ἸΩΣΉΦ</span></span></span>, and nothing more (in opposition to Bengel), that is marked out as coming under the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ἘΝΟΜΊΖΕΤΟ</span></span></span>, so also is it in the arrangement of Lachmann (only that the latter actually brings into stronger prominence the supposed <span class="ital">filial</span> relationship to Joseph); and if <span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span> is read before <span class="greekheb">Ἰωσήφ</span>, no change even in that case arises in the meaning.[75] For it is not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹΌς</span></span></span> that would have to be supplied in every following clause, so that <span class="ital">Jesus</span> should be designated as the son of each of the persons named, even up to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> inclusively (so Lightfoot, Bengel), but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹΟῦ</span></span></span> (after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ</span></span></span>), as the nature of the genealogical table in itself presents it,[76] making <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> also dogmatically indubitable; since, according to Luke’s idea of the divine sonship of Jesus, it could not occur to him to represent this <span class="ital">divine</span> sonship as having been effected through <span class="ital">Adam</span>. No; if Luke had <span class="ital">thought</span> what Wieseler reads between the lines in <a href="/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>, that, namely, Eli was <span class="ital">Mary’s</span> father, he would have known how to <span class="ital">express</span> it, and would have written something like this: <span class="greekheb">ὢν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς μὲν ἐνομίζετο</span>, <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς Ἰωσὴφ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὄντως</span> (<a href="/luke/23-47.htm" title="Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.">Luke 23:47</a>, <a href="/luke/24-34.htm" title="Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.">Luke 24:34</a>) <span class="greekheb">δὲ Μαρίας τοῦ Ἡλί κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. But <span class="ital">he desires to give the genealogy of Jesus on the side of His foster-father Joseph</span>: therefore he writes simply as we read, and as the fact that he wished to express required. As to the originally <span class="ital">Ebionitic</span> point of view of the genealogies in Matthew and Luke, see on <a href="/matthew/1-17.htm" title="So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.">Matthew 1:17</a>, Remark 3.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] So also Paulus, only that, after the example of Calvisius, he further attaches <span class="greekheb">ὤν</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἀρχόμενος</span>, in which case, however, it would be useless, and the subsequent genealogy would be without any connecting link. Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol. Synops</span>. p. 125, placing <span class="greekheb">ἀρχόμενος</span> before <span class="greekheb">ὡσεί</span> (so Lachmann in the margin and Tischendorf), explains: “and he was—namely, Jesus when He began—about thirty years of age.” Therefore in the most essential point his view is in agreement with ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] This indifferent <span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span> came into the text with extreme facility, in accordance with the analogy of all the following clauses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] Instances of a quite similar kind of stringing on the links of a genealogy one after the other by <span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span> are found in Herod. iv. 157, vii. 204, viii. 131, and others in Wetstein. The <span class="ital">Vulgate</span> is right in simply reading, “filius Joseph, <span class="ital">qui fait</span> Heli, <span class="ital">qui fuit</span> Matthat,” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All attempts to fix the year in which Jesus was born by means of the passage before us are balked by the <span class="greekheb">ὡσεί</span> of <a href="/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>. Yet the era of Dionysius bases its date, although incorrectly (754 after the foundation of Rome), on <a href="/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>; <a href="/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>. Hase, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> § 26, follows it, setting aside, because of its mythical associations, the account of Matthew, that the first childhood of Jesus occurred as early as the time of the reign of Herod the Great. But these legendary ingredients do not justify our rejecting a date fixed by a simple reference to the history of the time, for it is rather to be regarded as the nucleus around which the legend gathered. As, however, Herod died in 750 (Anger, <span class="ital">Rat. tempor</span>. p. 5 f.; Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol. Synopse</span>, p. 50 ff.), the era of Dionysius is at any rate at least about four years in error. If, further, it be necessary, according to this, to place the birth of Jesus <span class="ital">before</span> the death of Herod, which occurred in the beginning of April, then, even on the assumption that He was born as early as 750 (according to Wieseler, in February of that year), it follows that at the time when the Baptist, who was His senior only by a few months, appeared—according to <a href="/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>, in the year from the 19th August 781 to 782<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He would be about thirty-one years of age, which perfectly agrees with the <span class="greekheb">ὡσεί</span> of <a href="/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>, and the round number <span class="greekheb">τριάκοντα</span>; in which case it must be assumed as certain (comp. <a href="/mark/1-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.">Mark 1:9</a>) that He was baptized very soon after the appearance of John, at which precise point His Messianic <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span> commenced. If, however, as according to <a href="/matthew/2-7.htm" title="Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.">Matthew 2:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm" title="Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.">Matthew 2:16</a> is extremely probable, the birth of Jesus must be placed as early as perhaps a year before the date given above,[77] even the age that thus results of about thirty-two years is sufficiently covered by the indefinite statement of the passage before us; and the year 749 as the year of Christ’s birth tallies well enough with the Baptist beginning to preach in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius.[78]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[77] Not “<span class="ital">at least two years</span>, probably even <span class="ital">four</span> or <span class="ital">more</span> years,” Keim, D. <span class="ital">geschichtl.

See, on the other hand, Rösch in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. Deutsche Theol</span>. 1866, p. 4 ff. The assumption of the latter, that the year 2 before the era of Dionysius was the year of Christ’s birth, rests in accordance with ancient tradition, to be sure, yet on the very insecure foundation of the appearance of the star in the history of the Magi, and on distrust of the chronology of Herod and his sons as set forth by Josephus, for which Rösch has not adduced sufficient reasons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,...">Luke 3:23-38</a>. <span class="ital">The age of Jesus when He began His ministry, and His genealogy</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">began to be about thirty years of age</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">was about thirty years of age on beginning</span> (<span class="bld">His work</span>).

However the joining of John with Him is appropriate and seasonable; that he may not be supposed to have preceded Jesus by a longer interval.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 69]. Luke speaks becomingly; and whereas he had said, that <span class="ital">the word of God came unto</span> the Forerunner, <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>; with which comp. <a href="/john/10-35.htm" title="If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;">John 10:35</a> : he says that the Lord <span class="ital">began</span>, namely, not as a servant, but as the Son. The name, <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, is added, because a new scene and a new series of events are thrown open. The emphatic pronoun <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς</span>, <span class="ital">Himself</span>, put in the commencement, forms an antithesis to <span class="ital">John</span>: also John has his time of office noted by external marks, taken from <span class="ital">Tiberius</span>, etc., but the time of the beginning made by the Lord is defined by the <span class="ital">years</span> of the Lord <span class="ital">Himself</span> The Lord had now attained, after the remarkable advances and progress which marked His previous life, the regular and lawful age suited for His public ministry [<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>].—<span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐνομίζετο</span>, <span class="ital">as He was duly accounted</span>) The interpretation, <span class="ital">As He was supposed</span> [Engl.

Furthermore Luke does not say, <span class="greekheb">ὢν</span>, <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς Ἰωσὴφ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐνομίζετο</span>, but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὪΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ὠς ἘΝΟΜΊΖΕΤΟ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΥἹῸς ἸΩΣΉΦ</span></span></span>. Therefore this clause, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ἘΝΟΜΊΖΕΤΟ</span></span></span>, no less than that one to which it is immediately attached, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὪΝ ΥἹῸς</span></span></span>, extends its force to the whole genealogical scale; and that too, in such a way as that the several steps are to be understood according to what the case and relation of each require and demand. Jesus <span class="ital">was, as He was accounted</span>, son of Joseph: for not merely the opinion of men regarded Him as the son of Joseph, but even Joseph rendered to Him all the offices of a father, although he had not begotten Jesus. <span class="ital">He was, as He was accounted</span>, Son of Heli; and He was so truly. For His mother Mary had Heli for her father: and so also as to Heli being <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of Matthat</span> and of the rest of the fathers. So in <a href="/luke/3-36.htm" title="Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,">Luke 3:36</a> it was said, Sala <span class="ital">was, as he was accounted</span>, son of Cainan; whereas the Hellenistic Jews, following the LXX. interpretation reckoned him among the series of fathers after the flood. Therefore as far as concerns Joseph and Cainan, Luke, by the figure <span class="greekheb">πσοθεραπεία</span> [See Append.] or <span class="ital">anticipatory precaution</span>, thus counteracts the popular <span class="ital">opinion</span>, as Franc. Junius long ago saw, with which comp. Usher’s Chronol. Sacr., part i., ch. vi. f. 34: but in all the other parts of the genealogy he leaves all things inviolate and unaltered, inasmuch as agreeing with the Old Testament and the rest of the public documents and the truth itself, and as being acknowledged authentic by all, nay, he even stamps them with approval.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ Ἡλεὶ</span>, <span class="ital">Eli</span>) He was father of Mary, and father-in-law of Joseph. See note, <a href="/matthew/1-16.htm" title="And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.">Matthew 1:16</a>. As to the article <span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span> here so often repeated, it makes no matter whether you construe it with each antecedent proper name or with that which follows it. For in either construction Jesus is the son of each more remote father, the nearer father intervening. The LXX. interpretation render the Hebrew corresponding words, which are for the most part equivocal (capable of either construction), in either of the two ways: <a href="/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-4.htm" title="And at Jerusalem dwelled certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez;">Nehemiah 11:4</a>, etc. But it is more simple to take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ</span></span></span> as cohering with each noun [proper name] following: in the way in which, <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm" title="The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.">Matthew 1:1</a>, Jesus Christ is said to be the Son (<span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΙΟ͂<span class="greekheb">Υ</span></span></span>) of David, SON (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΙΟῦ</span></span></span>) of Abraham. And although in the first step of the series, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΙῸς ἸΩΣῊΦ</span></span></span> is the expression used without the article, yet subsequently the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὪΝ ὙΙῸς</span></span></span> are conveniently construed with each of the fathers immediately and directly [without the intervention of the names coming between], Comp. LXX. <a href="/genesis/36-2.htm" title="Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;">Genesis 36:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] We may observe in this place, that the <span class="ital">thirty</span> years were <span class="ital">not full</span> years, and past, but <span class="ital">wanting a little of completion</span>: a fact which is proved in the Harm. of Beng. pp. 70, 71, and Ord.
