St. Luke, as a physician of the soul, may well have delighted to place on record this example of true spiritual therapeutics.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/3-10.htm" title="And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?...">Luke 3:10-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the people asked him, What shall we do then? </span>— To avoid the judgments of God. <span class="ital">He answereth, He that hath two coats, </span>&c. — Be careful, not only to observe the ceremonies of religion, but to attend to the great duties of justice, mercy, and charity. The sum of all is: <span class="ital">Cease to do evil, learn to do well: </span>these are the fruits worthy of repentance. <span class="ital">Then came also publicans </span>— A set of men whose office it was to collect the taxes which the Romans had imposed on the Jews, and to pay them to others, who were called the chief of the publicans; and these people, being generally persons of an infamous character for their injustice and oppression, applied themselves to John, under a strong conviction of their guilt, and said, <span class="ital">Master, what shall we do? </span>— Namely, to testify the sincerity of our repentance. <span class="ital">And he said, Exact no more than is appointed you </span>— As if he had said, I do not require you absolutely to quit your employment, but take care that, in levying the taxes, you compel no man to pay you more than his just proportion of the sum which you are allowed by the law to raise. <span class="ital">And the soldiers </span>applied themselves to him on the same occasion, <span class="ital">saying, What shall we do? </span>— The Baptist’s sermons were so affecting, that they impressed men even of the most abandoned characters, such as the private soldiers in all countries commonly are. <span class="ital">And he said, Do violence to no man </span>— Commit no violence on any man’s person or property. “The word <span class="greekheb">διασεισητε </span>properly signifies, <span class="ital">to take a man by the</span> <span class="ital">collar and shake him; </span>and seems to have been used proverbially for that violent manner in which persons of this station of life are often ready to <span class="ital">bully </span>those about them, whom they imagine their inferiors in strength and spirit; though nothing is an argument of a meaner spirit, or more unworthy that true courage which constitutes so essential a part of a good military character.” — Doddridge. <span class="ital">Neither accuse any falsely </span>— Do not turn informers, and give false evidence against innocent persons, in order that with the protection of the law you may oppress them, and enrich yourselves with their spoils. The word <span class="greekheb">συκοφαντειν</span>, which we render, <span class="ital">to accuse falsely, </span>answers to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">עשׂק</span>, and signifies also <span class="ital">to circumvent </span>and <span class="ital">oppress. And be content with your wages </span>— Live quietly on your pay, and do not mutiny when your officers happen not to bestow on you donations and largesses to conciliate your favour. It is well known the word <span class="greekheb">οψωνιοις</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">wages, </span>signifies <span class="ital">provision, </span>or <span class="ital">food; </span>but, when applied to soldiers, it is generally used to signify the <span class="ital">pay </span>that was allotted for their subsistence. It appears that the soldiers who now addressed the Baptist were not heathen, but Jews; otherwise one part of his advice to them would certainly have been, that they should relinquish idolatry, and embrace the worship of the true God. To account for this it must be observed, that it was the custom of the Romans to recruit their armies in the conquered provinces, and, as the Jews did not scruple to engage in a military life, many of them may now have been in the emperor’s service. Or, we may suppose that after Judea was made a province, the Romans took into their pay the Jewish troops which Herod and his son Archelaus had maintained. See Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-14 The scope and design of John's ministry were, to bring the people from their sins, and to their Saviour. He came preaching, not a sect, or party, but a profession; the sign or ceremony was washing with water. By the words here used John preached the necessity of repentance, in order to the remission of sins, and that the baptism of water was an outward sign of that inward cleansing and renewal of heart, which attend, or are the effects of true repentance, as well as a profession of it. Here is the fulfilling of the Scriptures, Isa 40:3, in the ministry of John. When way is made for the gospel into the heart, by taking down high thoughts, and bringing them into obedience to Christ, by levelling the soul, and removing all that hinders us in the way of Christ and his grace, then preparation is made to welcome the salvation of God. Here are general warnings and exhortations which John gave. The guilty, corrupted race of mankind is become a generation of vipers; hateful to God, and hating one another. There is no way of fleeing from the wrath to come, but by repentance; and by the change of our way the change of our mind must be shown. If we are not really holy, both in heart and life, our profession of religion and relation to God and his church, will stand us in no stead at all; the sorer will our destruction be, if we do not bring forth fruits meet for repentance. John the Baptist gave instructions to several sorts of persons. Those that profess and promise repentance, must show it by reformation, according to their places and conditions. The gospel requires mercy, not sacrifice; and its design is, to engage us to do all the good we can, and to be just to all men. And the same principle which leads men to forego unjust gain, leads to restore that which is gained by wrong. John tells the soldiers their duty. Men should be cautioned against the temptations of their employments. These answers declared the present duty of the inquirers, and at once formed a test of their sincerity. As none can or will accept Christ's salvation without true repentance, so the evidence and effects of this repentance are here marked out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What shall we do, then? - John had told them to bring forth fruits appropriate to repentance, or to lead a life which showed that their repentance was genuine.

John doth not here countenance Anabaptist levelling, he only cautions them against Pharisaical hypocrisy, trusting to external privileges, such as having Abraham to their father, or some ritual and ceremonial performances, while in the mean time they neglected the weighty things of the law, of which Christ hath taught us that mercy is one. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the people asked him,....

St. Luke, as a physician of the soul, may well have delighted to place on record this example of true spiritual therapeutics." The same train of thought is followed out by Godet in his remark on the question contained in this verse: "It is the confessional after preaching." This little section (vers. 10-14), containing an epitome of questions placed before John by different classes of hearers touched by his soul-stirring preaching, is peculiar to our evangelist. It is clear that here, in the story of the ministry of the Baptist, Luke derived his knowledge of the details from an independent authority not used either by Matthew or Mark. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Asked (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Imperfect tense, indicating the frequent repetition of these questions. </body></html>
