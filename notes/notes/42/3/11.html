He came preaching, not a sect, or party, but a profession; the sign or ceremony was washing with water. By the words here used John preached the necessity of repentance, in order to the remission of sins, and that the baptism of water was an outward sign of that inward cleansing and renewal of heart, which attend, or are the effects of true repentance, as well as a profession of it. Here is the fulfilling of the Scriptures, Isa 40:3, in the ministry of John. When way is made for the gospel into the heart, by taking down high thoughts, and bringing them into obedience to Christ, by levelling the soul, and removing all that hinders us in the way of Christ and his grace, then preparation is made to welcome the salvation of God. Here are general warnings and exhortations which John gave. The guilty, corrupted race of mankind is become a generation of vipers; hateful to God, and hating one another. There is no way of fleeing from the wrath to come, but by repentance; and by the change of our way the change of our mind must be shown. If we are not really holy, both in heart and life, our profession of religion and relation to God and his church, will stand us in no stead at all; the sorer will our destruction be, if we do not bring forth fruits meet for repentance. John the Baptist gave instructions to several sorts of persons. Those that profess and promise repentance, must show it by reformation, according to their places and conditions. The gospel requires mercy, not sacrifice; and its design is, to engage us to do all the good we can, and to be just to all men. And the same principle which leads men to forego unjust gain, leads to restore that which is gained by wrong. John tells the soldiers their duty. Men should be cautioned against the temptations of their employments. These answers declared the present duty of the inquirers, and at once formed a test of their sincerity. As none can or will accept Christ's salvation without true repentance, so the evidence and effects of this repentance are here marked out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that hath two coats ... - Or, in other words, aid the poor according to your ability; be benevolent, and you will thus show that your repentance is genuine.

By telling them what they should do; and he does not put them upon ceremonial observances, nor severe exercises of religion, nor even the duties of the first table of the law, and others of the second, though necessary to be done; but upon acts of beneficence and kindness, to fellow creatures in distress; and are what may be called love of our neighbour, and which involves the love of God, and so the whole law; for the one cannot be rightly exercised without the other: <p>he that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; not both of them, but one of them: a man is not obliged to go naked himself, in order to clothe another; and so the Persic and Ethiopic versions read, "let him give one to him that has not"; that has not a garment to wear. This is not to be understood strictly and literally, that a man is obliged to give one of his coats, if he has more than one, to a person in want of clothing; it will be sufficient to answer the intent of this exhortation, if he supplies his want another way, by furnishing him with money to buy one: the meaning is, that persons according to their abilities, and of what they can spare, should communicate to those that are in distress: much less is it to be concluded from hence, that it is not lawful for a man to have more coats than one: <p>and he that hath meat, or meats,  <p>let him do likewise; that is, he that has a sufficiency of food, and more than enough for himself and family, let him give it freely and cheerfully to the poor and needy, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased: and when such acts of kindness are done in faith, from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God, they are the fruits of grace, and such as are meet for repentance, and show it to be genuine. John instances in these two articles, food and raiment, as containing the necessaries of human life, and including every thing, by which one may be serviceable to another. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/3-11.htm" title="He answers and said to them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise.">Luke 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">δύο χ</span>.: two, one to spare, not necessarily two on the person, one enough; severely simple ideas of life.

The counsel is: let him that hath food give to him that hath none, so inculcating a generous, humane spirit. Here the teaching of John, as reported by Lk., touches that of Jesus, and is evangelical not legal in spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">He that hath two coats</span>] St Luke alone preserves for us the details in this interesting section. Beyond the single upper garment (<span class="ital">chiton, cetoneth</span>), and garment (<span class="ital">himation</span>) and girdle, no other article of dress was necessary. A second ‘tunic’ or <span class="ital">cetoneth</span> was a mere luxury, so long as thousands were too poor to own even one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let him impart to him that hath none</span>] St Paul gave similar advice (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened:...">2 Corinthians 8:13-15</a>), and St James (<a href="/context/james/2-15.htm" title="If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,...">James 2:15-17</a>), and St John (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>), because they had learnt this spirit from Christ. A literal fulfilment of it has often been represented by Christian Art in the “Charity of St Martin.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">meat</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">food</span>. The word has now acquired the specific sense of ‘flesh,’ which it never has in our E. V. For instance the “meat-offering” was generally an offering of flour and oil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may notice the following particulars respecting the preaching of the Baptist:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) It was <span class="ital">stern</span>, as was natural to an ascetic whose very aspect and mission were modelled on the example of Elijah. The particulars of his life, and dress, and food—the leathern girdle, the mantle of camel’s hair, the living on locusts and wild honey—are preserved for us by the other Evangelists, and they gave him that power of mastery over others which always springs from perfect self-control, and absolute self-abnegation. Hence “in his manifestation and agency he was like a burning torch; his whole life was a very earthquake; the whole man was a sermon.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) It was absolutely <span class="ital">dauntless</span>. The unlettered Prophet of the Desert has not a particle of respect for the powerful Sadducees and long-robed luxurious Rabbis, and disdains to be flattered by their coming to listen to his teaching. Having nothing to hope from man’s favour, he has nothing to fear from man’s dislike.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) It shews remarkable <span class="ital">insight into human nature</span>, and into the needs and temptations of every class which came to him,—shewing that his ascetic seclusion did not arise from any contempt of, or aversion to, his fellowmen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(4) It was <span class="ital">intensely practical</span>. Not only does it exclude all abstract and theological terms such as ‘justification,’ &c., but it says nothing directly of even faith, or love. In this respect it recalls the Old Testament, and might be summed up in the words of Balaam preserved in the prophet Micah, “He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” <a href="/micah/6-8.htm" title="He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?">Micah 6:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(5) Yet though it still belongs to the dispensation of the shadow it <span class="ital">prophesies of the dawn</span>. His first message was “Repent;” his second was “The kingdom of heaven is at hand:” and this message culminated in the words “Behold the Lamb of God,” which shewed that the <span class="ital">Olam habba</span> or ‘future age’ had already begun. These two great utterances “contain the two capital revelations to which all the preparation of the Gospel has been tending.” “Law and Prophecy; denunciation of sin and promise of pardon; the flame which consumes and the light which consoles—is not this the whole of the covenant?” Lange.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(6) <span class="ital">It does not claim the credentials of a single miracle</span>. The glory and greatness of John the Baptist, combined with the fact that not a single wonder is attributed to him, is the strongest argument for the truth of the Gospels against the ‘mythical theory’ of Strauss, who reduces the Gospel miracles to a circle of imaginative legends devised to glorify the Founder of Christianity. At the same time this acknowledged absence of miraculous powers enhances our conception of the enormous moral force which sufficed, without a sign, to stir to its very depths the heart of a sign-demanding age.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(7) <span class="ital">It had only a partial and temporary popularity</span>. Rejected by the Pharisees who said that “he had a devil,” the Baptist failed to produce a permanent influence on more than a chosen few (<a href="/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>; <a href="/luke/7-30.htm" title="But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.">Luke 7:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-18.htm" title="For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.">Matthew 11:18</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/21-23.htm" title="And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority?...">Matthew 21:23-27</a>; <a href="/acts/18-25.htm" title="This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="/context/acts/19-3.htm" title="And he said to them, To what then were you baptized? And they said, To John's baptism....">Acts 19:3-4</a>). After his imprisonment he seems to have fallen into neglect, and he himself felt from the first that his main mission was to prepare the way for another, and to decrease before him. He was “the lamp kindled and shining” (<a href="/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>) which becomes needless and ceases to be noticed when the sun has dawned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/3-11.htm" title="He answers and said to them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise.">Luke 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἔχων</span>, <span class="ital">he who hath</span>) The people were inclined to avarice above all other faults. Therefore John gives them injunctions directly opposed to this sin, viz. injunctions respecting meat and raiment. The fruit of a thoroughly inward repentance [which, as well as the general testimony of John concerning the Christ, is taken for granted here.—V. g.] passes forth to the outermost parts of the life: <a href="/context/luke/3-13.htm" title="And he said to them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you....">Luke 3:13-14</a> : and does not consist in mere specious works, but in such as become us as citizens, and yet are real good works: ch. <a href="/luke/10-34.htm" title="And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.">Luke 10:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm" title="For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:">Matthew 25:35</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/58-6.htm" title="Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?...">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>.—<span class="greekheb">δύο χιτῶνας</span>, <span class="ital">two coats</span> [rather <span class="ital">tunics</span> or <span class="ital">inner vests</span>]) and so as regards other articles of which we possess duplicates.—<span class="greekheb">μεταδότω</span>, <span class="ital">let him impart</span>) Liberality is wider in its range of comprehension, than generosity merely in money matters.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise</span>. This advice is simple and practical. No difficult counsels of perfection are recommended, no useless penance. The great confessor simply presses home to his penitents  the duty of unselfishness, the beauty of quiet generosity in the sight of God. The whole teaching of this eminent man of God was thoroughly practical. His predecessor, Micah, centuries before had given the luxurious and selfish Israel of his time the same Divine lesson: "He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
