Not only did men like Paul and his brother apostles welcome persecution "for the Name" with joy, but long after Paul and his fellows had "fallen asleep," Christians in well-nigh every populous centre of the empire followed the same glorious lead. Indeed, we find the great teachers of the faith positively condemning the fiery zeal of men and women who even too literally obeyed this and other like charges of their adored Master, who positively courted a painful martyrdom, too willingly throwing away their lives, so deeply had words like these burned into their souls. The terrible persecutions which many of the old Hebrew prophets underwent were well known. These men of God endured this treatment during several generations, while evil princes sat on the thrones of Judah and Israel. Thus Elijah mourned the wholesale massacre of his brother prophets when Ahab and Jezebel reigned (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>). Urijah was slain by Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a>). Jeremiah himself underwent long and painful persecution. Amos was accused and banished, and, according to tradition, beaten to death. Isaiah, so the Jews said, was sawn asunder by order of King Manasseh. These are only a few instances of the treatment which faithful prophets of the Lord had undergone. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Leap for joy (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>See <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-41.htm">Luke 1:41</a>, <a href="/luke/1-44.htm">Luke 1:44</a>.
