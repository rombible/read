God Himself is our “exceeding great reward” (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1</a>). One or two MSS. give a masculine instead of a neuter pronoun after the verb, and in that case the verb must be taken as transitive. We have accordingly to choose between <span class= "ital">in nothing despairing,</span> or <span class= "ital">driving no man to despair.</span> On the whole, the former seems preferable. So taken, we may compare it with St. Paul’s description of “charity” or “love,” as “hoping all things” (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-7.htm" title="Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.">1Corinthians 13:7</a>), and his counsel, “Be not weary in well doing” (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The children of the Highest.</span>—Better, for the sake of uniformity with the other passages where the word occurs, <span class= "ital">sons of the Most High.</span> The passage is noticeable as the only instance in which our Lord Himself applies this name to the Father.<p><span class= "bld">He is kind.</span>—The generalised word takes the place of the more specific reference to the rain and sunshine as God’s gifts to all, in <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm" title="That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.">Matthew 5:45</a>.

I know not how to agree, what I find many interpreters judging, that this text is a prohibition of usury. I should rather interpret it more largely, as a command for acts of mercy, with respect to the circumstances of persons, obliging us not to withhold a charitable hand, from our fear that if we lend we shall lose what we lend, and obliging us, that if we find the circumstances of any that desireth us to lend him for his necessity such a quantity of money or goods as we can spare, and we can well enough bear the loss of, if the providence of God should render the person unable to repay us, we should not be awed by such a fear from acts of charity, but give with a resolution to lose it, if God please to disable the person to whom we lend, so as he cannot repay us. For the question about usury, as to which some conceive this text a prohibition, this is not a place to handle it in the latitude. I do not think it was ever absolutely forbidden to the Jews, they might take it of strangers, and that not only of the Canaanites, whom some say they might kill, (which I doubt after their agreement to a quiet cohabitation), but of other strangers also who came not under the denomination of Canaanites. That argued the taking of usury to be not <span class="ital">malum per se</span>, in itself evil, but only <span class="ital">malum prohibitum</span>, an evil as forbidden; and not absolutely and universally forbidden, but respectively, only with reference to their brethren of the same church and nation; so rather to be reckoned amongst the municipal laws of the Jews, than the common laws of God for all mankind. Besides that amongst the Jews there was less need of it, partly in respect of their years of jubilee, and partly in regard their employments were chiefly in husbandry, and about cattle, which called not for such sums of money as merchandising doth. Nor is it to be referred to any of the ten commandments, unless the eighth, <span class="ital">Thou</span> <span class="ital">shalt not steal</span>; which forbidding sins against charity, and such sins against charity being there forbidden as are the taking away the goods of another against his will, and without a just cause, I cannot see how the lending of money for a moderate use, when it is helpful and relieving to our neighbour, should be any kind of stealing, when his good will appeareth in the contract; nor can there be any injustice in it, where there is a <span class="ital">quid pro quo, </span> but a proportion for what I am endamaged by the loan; unless any will say it is unjust because against the law of God, which is to beg the question, this argument being brought to prove it is not contrary to the law of God. The exacting of all undue proportion for usury, or a moderate proportion, when we plainly see our brother is fallen into poverty, and cannot pay it, may be forbidden, as a sin against charity, and that love that we ought to show to our neighbours, and the mercifulness here required, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/6-36.htm" title="Be you therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.">Luke 6:36</a></span>. Yet, admitting the law of God, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm" title="You shall not lend on usury to your brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent on usury:">Deu 23:19</a>,20</span>, to be interpreted of all usury, (which yet seemeth hard, for then the Jews might not sell for any thing more at twelve months’ time, than if they were paid presently, for the words are <span class="ital">usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing lent</span> <span class="ital">upon usury</span>), it concerned the Jews only between themselves, not in their dealings with any strangers, which is plain, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a></span>; so also <span class="bld"><a href="/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a></span>, where the term <span class="ital">poor</span> is also put in, as it is <span class="bld"><a href="/context/leviticus/25-35.htm" title="And if your brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you; then you shall relieve him: yes, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you....">Leviticus 25:35-37</a></span>; by which texts the psalmist must be expounded, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/15-5.htm" title="He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent.

It may possibly from the equity of that law oblige us to be more kind to those that are of the same nation and church with us, than unto others, especially such as are no Christians; and amongst those that are Christians, to those that are poor, than to those who have better estates. But, as I said in the beginning, I had rather interpret the precept of the text more largely, as a general precept of mercy, from the example of our heavenly Father. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But love ye your enemies,....

The meaning of <span class="greekheb">ὀπελπίζειν</span> is <span class="ital">desperare</span>; it belongs to later Greek, and frequently occurs in Diodorus and Polybius, which latter, moreover (xxxi. 8. 11), has <span class="greekheb">ἀπελπισμός</span>, <span class="ital">desperatio</span>. Comp. Wetstein. An erroneous use of the word, however, is the less to be attributed to Luke, that it was also familiar to him from the LXX. (<a href="/isaiah/29-19.htm" title="The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 29:19</a>) and the Apocrypha (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-18.htm" title="But for all this his pains would not cease: for the just judgment of God was come upon him: therefore despairing of his health, he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the form of a supplication, after this manner:">2Ma 9:18</a>, where also the accusative stands with it, <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/22-21.htm" title="Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning to favour.">Sir 22:21</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/27-21.htm" title="As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.">Sir 27:21</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/9-11.htm" title="For thy power standeth not in multitude nor thy might in strong men: for thou art a God of the afflicted, an helper of the oppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, a saviour of them that are without hope.">Jdt 9:11</a>). Hence the true meaning is “<span class="ital">nihil desperantes</span>” (codd. of It.; so also Homberg, Elsner, Wetstein, Bretschneider, Schegg).

It has been objected by the enemies of Christianity that, after all, Jesus offered his followers a reward by way of payment to them for their self-sacrificing lives on earth. What, however, is this reward? Is it not a share in that Divine and glorious life of God, who is all love; a hope of participation in that eternal work of his which will go from blessing to blessing, from glory to glory; a certain expectation of dying only to wake up in his likeness, satisfied? The Eternal had already made a similar promise to his faithful servant Abraham. when he bade him fear not, because here on earth God was his Shield, and after death would be his exceeding great Reward. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hoping for nothing again (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>A later Greek word, only here in New Testament, and meaning originally to give up in despair, a sense which is adopted by some high authorities, and by Rev., never despairing.
