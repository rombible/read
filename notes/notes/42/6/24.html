(Comp. <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm" title="But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in.">Matthew 23:13</a>; <a href="/mark/13-17.htm" title="But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!">Mark 13:17</a>; <a href="/luke/21-23.htm" title="But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath on this people.">Luke 21:23</a>.) We enter here on what is a distinct feature of the Sermon on the Plain—the woes that, as it were, balance the beatitudes. It obviously lay in St. Luke’s purpose, as a physician of the soul, to treasure up and record all our Lord’s warnings against the perilous temptations that wealth brings with it. The truth thus stated in its naked awfulness is reproduced afterwards in the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-19.htm" title="There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:">Luke 16:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye have received your consolation.</span>—Better, simply, <span class= "ital">ye have your consolation</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> all that you understand or care for, all, therefore, that you can have. The thought appears again in the words of Abraham, “Thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things” (<a href="/luke/16-25.htm" title="But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.">Luke 16:25</a>). The verb is the same as in “they have their reward,” in <a href="/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation....">Luke 6:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">But wo, </span>&c. — Here we see that this discourse differs very materially from the sermon on the mount; there our Lord pronounced <span class="ital">blessings </span>only, here he denounces <span class="ital">curses; </span>or, to speak more properly, he compassionately bewails the condition of persons of a contrary character to that of those pronounced happy in the preceding verses. For, as Grotius justly observes, the expression, <span class="greekheb">ουαι υμιν</span>, <span class="ital">wo unto you, </span>“vox est dolentis, non irâ incensi,” <span class="ital">is the expression of one lamenting, </span>[or bewailing the unhappy condition of another,] <span class="ital">not of one inflamed with anger. </span>It is like that used by our Lord, <a href="/matthew/24-19.htm" title="And woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!">Matthew 24:19</a>, <span class="ital">wo to them that are with child,</span> &c<span class="ital">., in those days; </span>an expression which no one can understand otherwise than as a declaration of the unhappiness of women in these circumstances, at such a time of general calamity as is referred to. The parallel passage in <a href="/luke/23-29.htm" title="For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never gave suck.">Luke 23:29</a> where we have the same prophecy, makes this evident. As our Lord, therefore, in the former sentences, pronounces the poor, the needy, the mournful, and the persecuted happy, so he here pronounces the rich, the jovial, and the applauded, miserable; the circumstances in which such are placed being peculiarly insnaring, and the danger being great lest they should be so taken up with the transient pleasures of time, as to forget and forfeit everlasting happiness. His words may be thus paraphrased: Miserable are <span class="ital">ye rich </span>— If ye have received or sought your consolation or happiness in your riches. Miserable are <span class="ital">you that are full </span>— Of meat and drink, and worldly goods, and take up with these things as your portion; <span class="ital">for you shall </span>ere long <span class="ital">hunger </span>— Shall fall into a state of great indigence and misery, aggravated by all the plenty which you enjoyed and abused. Miserable are <span class="ital">you that laugh </span>— That spend your lives in mirth and gayety, or are of a light, trifling spirit; <span class="ital">for you shall mourn and weep </span>— You have reason to expect a portion in those doleful regions, where, without intermission and without end, you shall be abandoned to weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. “Our Lord’s malediction,” [declaration,] says a modern author, “is not inconsistent with the apostle’s precepts, which command Christians always to rejoice. Neither is the mirth against which the wo is here denounced to be understood of that constant cheerfulness of temper, which arises to true Christians from the comfortable and cheerful doctrines with which they are enlightened by the gospel, the assurance they have of reconciliation with God, the hope they have of everlasting life and the pleasure they enjoy in the practice of piety and the other duties of religion. But it is to be understood of that turbulent, carnal mirth, that levity and vanity of spirit, which arises, not from any solid foundation, but from sensual pleasure, or those vain amusements of life by which the giddy and the gay contrive to make away their time; that sort of mirth which dissipates thought, leaves no time for consideration, and gives them an utter aversion to all serious reflections.” Persons who continue to indulge themselves in this sort of mirth through life, shall weep and mourn eternally, when they are excluded from the joys of heaven, and banished for ever from the presence of God, by the light of whose countenance all the blessed are enlightened, and made transcendently happy.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:20-26 Here begins a discourse of Christ, most of which is also found in Mt 5; 7. But some think that this was preached at another time and place. All believers that take the precepts of the gospel to themselves, and live by them, may take the promises of the gospel to themselves, and live upon them. Woes are denounced against prosperous sinners as miserable people, though the world envies them. Those are blessed indeed whom Christ blesses, but those must be dreadfully miserable who fall under his woe and curse! What a vast advantage will the saint have over the sinner in the other world! and what a wide difference will there be in their rewards, how much soever the sinner may prosper, and the saint be afflicted here!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses have been omitted by Matthew. They seem to have been spoken to the Pharisees.<p>Who are rich - In this world's goods. They loved them; they had sought for them; they found their consolation in them. It implies, farther, that they would not seek or receive consolation from the gospel. They were proud, and would not seek it; satisfied, and did not desire it; filled with cares, and had no time or disposition to attend to it. All the consolation which they had reason to expect they had received. Alas! how poor and worthless is such consolation, compared with that which the gospel would give!<p>Woe unto you that are full! - Not hungry. Satisfied with their wealth, and not feeling their need of anything better than earthly wealth can give. Many, alas! are thus "full." They profess to be satisfied. They desire nothing but wealth, and a sufficiency to satisfy the wants of the body. They have no anxiety for the riches that shall endure forever.<p>Ye shall hunger - Your property shall be taken away, or you shall see that it is of little value; and then you shall see the need of something better. You shall feel your want and wretchedness, and shall "hunger" for something to satisfy the desires of a dying, sinful soul.<p>That laugh now - Are happy, or thoughtless, or joyful, or filled with levity.<p>Shall mourn and weep - The time is coming when you shall sorrow deeply. In sickness, in calamity, in the prospect of death, in the fear of eternity, your laughter shall be turned into sorrow. "There is" a place where you cannot laugh, and there you will see the folly of having passed the "proper time" of preparing for such scenes in levity and folly. Alas! how many thus spend their youth! and how many weep when it is too late! God gives them over, and "laughs" at their "calamity," and mocks when their fear comes, <a href="/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>. To be happy in "such scenes," it is necessary to be sober, humble, pious in early life.

These, as a class, opposed Jesus with a bitter and unreasoning opposition. Again the same warning cry to the so-called fortunate ones of this world is re-echoed with greater force in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. "Thou in thy lifetime," said Abraham, speaking from Paradise to the poor lost Dives, "receivedst thy good things;" and yet the very characters represented in that most awful of the parable-stories of the pitiful Lord correct any false notion which, from words like these, men may entertain respecting the condemnation of the rich and great because they are rich and great. Abraham, who speaks the grave stern words, was himself a sheik of great power and consideration, and at the same time very rich. Prophets and apostles, as well as the Son of God, never ceased to warn men of the danger of misusing wealth and power; but at the same time they always represented these dangerous gifts as gifts from God, capable of a noble use, and, if nobly used, these teachers sent by God pointed out, these gifts would bring to the men who so used them a proportional reward. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Woe<p>These woes are not noted by Matthew.<p>Have received (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16</a>, the Rev. has properly changed "they have their reward" to "they have received."

Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>, when Paul says, "I have all things (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)," he does not mean merely an acknowledgment of the receipt of the Church's gift, but that he is fully furnished. "I have all things to the full."<p>Consolation (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, to the side of, and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to call or summon. Literally, a calling to one's side to help; and therefore entreaty, passing on into the sense of exhortation, and thence into that of consolatory exhortation; and so coming round to mean that which one is summoned to give to a suppliant - consolation. Thus it embodies the call for help, and the response to the call. Its use corresponds with that of the kindred verb &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to exhort or console. In its original sense of calling for aid the noun appears in the New Testament only in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm">2 Corinthians 8:4</a> : with much entreaty. The verb appears frequently in this sense, rendered beseech, pray (<a href="/matthew/8-34.htm">Matthew 8:34</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-36.htm">Matthew 14:36</a>; <a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/5-12.htm">Mark 5:12</a>, etc.). In the sense of consolation or comfort the noun occurs in <a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a>; Plm 1:7. The verb, in <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a> :; <a href="/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>. In some instances, however, the meaning wavers between console and exhort. In the sense of exhortation or counsel, the noun may be found in <a href="/acts/13-15.htm">Acts 13:15</a>; <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-22.htm">Hebrews 13:22</a>. The verb, in <a href="/acts/2-40.htm">Acts 2:40</a>; <a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>; <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>. Neither the noun nor the verb appear in the writings of John, but the kindred word &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; the Paraclete, Comforter, or Advocate, is peculiar to him. On this word, see on <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>. It should be noted, however, that the word comfort goes deeper than its popular conception of soothing. It is from the later Latin confortare, to make strong. Thus Wycliffe renders <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-80.htm">Luke 1:80</a>, "the child waxed, and was comforted in spirit" (A. V., waxed strong); and Tyndale, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>, "there appeared an angel from heaven comforting him" (A. V., strengthening). The comfort which Christ gives is not always soothing. The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is to convince of sin and of judgment. Underlying the word is the sense of a wise counsel or admonition which rouses and braces the moral nature and encourages and strengthens it to do and to endure. When, therefore, Christ says "they that mourn shall be comforted," he speaks in recognition of the fact that all sorrow is the outcome of sin, and that true comfort is given, not only in pardon for the past, but in strength to fight and resist and overcome sin. The atmosphere of the word, in short, is not the atmosphere of the sick-chamber, but the tonic breath of the open world, of moral struggle and victory; the atmosphere for him that climbs and toils and fights. </body></html>
