For as the apostleship clothed the person on whom it was conferred with the high authority of directing the religious faith of mankind, it was of no small importance to the world to know who they were to whom that dignity belonged. In these catalogues, Simon is first named, not because he was of greater dignity than the rest, but because he was one of the most early followers of Christ, and the first that was called to a stated attendance upon him, and a person whose remarkable zeal and piety rendered him a kind of leader among the others. These reasons are so evidently sufficient for his being named first, that it is strange any should have attempted to prove from that circumstance, that Christ invested him with authority over his brethren; when we never find any such thing declared by Christ, or claimed by Peter, or owned by any of the other apostles, but rather find many scriptures which appear to look a contrary way; Matthew and Luke mention Andrew next to Peter, as being his brother, and one of Christ’s first disciples. The names of James and John follow, as having been called next, (see <a href="/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>,) and being persons of great eminence for piety and usefulness, and James is placed before John, as being the elder brother. The names of the others seem to be placed nearly, at least, in the order in which they became disciples. Judas Iscariot, however, though, perhaps, not last called, is named last, because he was the traitor. But whatever might be the reason of ranking the apostles in the catalogue in the order in which we find them, we are certain they are not ranged according to their dignity; for, had that been the case, the order of the names would have been exactly the same in all the evangelists, which it is not, Andrew being placed the second in order, as we have observed, by Matthew and Luke, and the fourth by Mark; and Thomas being placed before Matthew by that apostle, and after him by Mark and Luke. To this may be added, on supposition that the apostles are ranked in the catalogues according to their dignity, it would follow, that John and Matthew, whose praise is in all the churches, on account of their writings, were inferior to apostles who are scarce once named, except in the catalogues. With regard to the epithet, or surname, (<span class="ital">Zelotes, the Zealous,</span>) added by Luke here to the name of Simon; because there was a particular sect or faction, among the Jews, termed <span class="ital">the Zealots, </span>who, in later times, under colour of zeal for God, committed all imaginable disorders, some are of opinion, that Simon the apostle had formerly been one of this faction. But as there is no mention made of that sect till a little before the destruction of Jerusalem, (Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell., <a href="/luke/4-3.htm" title="And the devil said to him, If you be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.">Luke 4:3</a></span>,) we may rather suppose that this epithet was added to his name on account of his uncommon zeal in matters of true piety and religion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:12-19 We often think one half hour a great deal to spend in meditation and secret prayer, but Christ was whole nights engaged in these duties. In serving God, our great care should be not to lose time, but to make the end of one good duty the beginning of another. The twelve apostles are here named; never were men so privileged, yet one of them had a devil, and proved a traitor. Those who have not faithful preaching near them, had better travel far than be without it. It is indeed worth while to go a great way to hear the word of Christ, and to go out of the way of other business for it. They came to be cured by him, and he healed them. There is a fulness of grace in Christ, and healing virtue in him, ready to go out from him, that is enough for all, enough for each. Men regard the diseases of the body as greater evils than those of their souls; but the Scripture teaches us differently.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-16.

According to Schleiermacher also, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 369, the persons of the apostolic band were not always the same, and the different catalogues belong to different periods.

Each list falls into three tetrads, and the last two tetrads are arranged in slightly varying pairs. “The Apostolic College was formed of three concentric circles—each less closely intimate with Jesus than the last.” Godet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>ii. In each tetrad the names refer to the same persons though the <span class="ital">order</span> is different.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>iii. In each list the <span class="ital">first</span> of each tetrad is the same—viz. Simon, Philip, and James son of Alphaeus; not as ‘supreme among inferior, but as first among equals.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>iv. In each list Simon stands first; and Judas Iscariot last, as the ‘son of perdition.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>v. Not only do the Apostles seem to be named in the order of their eminence and nearness to Christ, but the first four seem to stand alone (in the Acts the first four are separated by “and;” the rest are ranged in pairs). The first four were the <span class="ital">eklekton eklektoteroi</span>—the chosen of the chosen; the <span class="ital">ecclesiola in ecclesia.</span> Andrew, who is named last in St Mark and the Acts, though belonging to the inmost band of Apostles (<a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>) and though the earliest of them all (<a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>), was yet less highly honoured than the other three (who are the <span class="greekheb">θεολογικώτατοι</span> at the healing of Jairus’s daughter, <a href="/mark/5-37.htm" title="And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.">Mark 5:37</a>; at the Transfiguration, <a href="/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,">Matthew 17:1</a>; and in Gethsemane, <a href="/matthew/26-37.htm" title="And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.">Matthew 26:37</a>). He seems to have been a link of communication between the first and second tetrads (<a href="/john/12-22.htm" title="Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.">John 12:22</a>; <a href="/john/6-8.htm" title="One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,">John 6:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>vi. The first five Apostles were of Bethsaida; and all the others seem to have been Galilaeans with the single exception of Judas Iscariot, who belonged to a Jewish town (see <a href="/luke/6-16.htm" title="And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.">Luke 6:16</a>). The only Greek names are those of Philip and Andrew (see <a href="/context/john/12-21.htm" title="The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus....">John 12:21-22</a>). At this time however many Jews bore Greek names.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>vii. In the <span class="ital">second</span> tetrad it may be regarded as certain that Bartholomew (the son of Tolmai) is the disciple whom St John calls Nathanael. He may possibly have been Philip’s brother. St Matthew puts his own name last, and adds the title of reproach <span class="ital">the tax-gatherer.</span> In the two other Evangelists he precedes St Thomas. The name Thomas merely means ‘a twin’ (Didymus), and one tradition says that he was a twin-brother of Matthew, and that <span class="ital">his</span> name too was Jude (Euseb. <span class="ital">H. E.</span> i. 13).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>viii. In the <span class="ital">third</span> tetrad we find one Apostle with three names. His real name was Jude, but as there was already one Jude among the Apostles, and as it was the commonest of Jewish names, and as there was also a Jude who was one of the ‘brethren of the Lord,’ he seems to have two surnames—<span class="ital">Lebbaeus</span>, from <span class="ital">lebh</span>, ‘heart,’ and <span class="ital">Thaddaeus</span> (another form of Theudas, <a href="/acts/5-36.htm" title="For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.">Acts 5:36</a>), from <span class="ital">Thad,</span> ‘bosom’—possibly, as some have conjectured, from the warmth and tenderness of his disposition. (Very few follow Clemens of Alexandria and Ewald in trying to identify Lebbaeus and Levi.) This disciple is called by St Luke (viz. here and in Acts i 13) “Jude of James,” or “James’s Jude,” and the English Version supplies the word “brother” (see Winer, p. 238). There is however no more decisive reason to supply “brother” (which is at any rate a very unusual ellipse) than in the former verse, where James is called “James of Alphaeus” (Chalpai, Klôpa, <a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>, perhaps also Kleopas (<a href="/luke/24-18.htm" title="And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?">Luke 24:18</a>), since Jews often Graecised the form of their names). The word ‘brother,’ where needed, is expressed, as in <a href="/luke/6-14.htm" title="Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,">Luke 6:14</a>. This three-named disciple was probably a son of James (compare Nonnus <a href="/john/14-22.htm" title="Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?">John 14:22</a> <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδὰς υἱὸς Ἰακώβοιο</span>), and therefore a grandson of Alphaeus, and a nephew of Matthew and Thomas. James the son of Alphaeus is sometimes called “the Less;” but this seems to be a mistaken rendering of <span class="greekheb">ὁ μικρὸς</span> (<a href="/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>), which means ‘the short of stature.’ The other James is never called ‘the Great.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>ix. Simon Zelotes is called by St Matthew ‘the Kananite’ (<span class="greekheb">ὁ Κανανίτης</span>), or according to the better readings ‘the Kananean.’ The word does not mean “Canaanite,” as our Version incorrectly gives it, nor yet ‘inhabitant of Kana in Galilee,’ but means the same thing as ‘the Zealot,’ from Kineáh, ‘zeal.’ He had therefore once belonged to the sect of terrible fanatics—the Carbonari of Palestine—who thought any deed of violence justifiable for the recovery of national freedom. He may have been one of the wild followers of Judas the Gaulonite. (Jos. B. J. IV. 3, § 9, and passim.) The name ‘Zealot’ was derived from <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-50.htm" title="Now therefore, my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.">1Ma 2:50</a>, where the dying Mattathias, father of Judas Maccabaeus, says to the Assidaeans (Chasidim, i.e. ‘all such as were voluntarily devoted to the law’) “Be ye zealous for the Law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers” (comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-2.htm" title="Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deserved well of the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so zealous of the laws.">2Ma 4:2</a>). It shews our Lord’s divine wisdom and fearless universality of love that He should choose for Apostles two persons who had once been at such deadly opposition as a tax-gatherer and a zealot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>x. For “Judas Iscariot who also betrayed him” St Luke uses the milder description, <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἐγένετο προδότης</span>, ‘who became a traitor.’ The name Iscariot has nothing to do with askara, ‘strangulation,’ or sheker, ‘lie,’ but is in all probability Eesh Kerioth, ‘man of Kerioth,’ just as Istôbos stands in Josephus (Antt. VII. 6, § 1) for ‘man of Tôb.’ Kerioth (<a href="/joshua/15-25.htm" title="And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,">Joshua 15:25</a>) is perhaps Kuryetein, ten miles from Hebron, in the southern border of Judah. If the reading “Iscariot” is right in <a href="/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>; <a href="/john/13-26.htm" title="Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.">John 13:26</a> (<span class="greekheb">א</span>,<span class="greekheb"> </span>B, C, G, L), as applied also to Simon Zelotes, then, since Judas is called “son of Simon” (<a href="/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>), the last pair of Apostles were father and son. If Judas Iscariot had ever shared the wild Messianic patriotism of his father it would partly account for the recoil of disgust and disappointment which helped to ruin his earthly mind when he saw that he had staked all in the cause of one who was rejected and despised. Yet even Judas was a witness, and a very important one, to the perfect innocence of his Lord (<a href="/matthew/27-4.htm" title="Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see you to that.">Matthew 27:4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>xi. It is a deeply interesting fact, if it be a fact (and although it cannot be made out with certainty because it depends on data which are conjectural, and on tradition which is liable to error—it is still far from improbable) that so many of the Apostles were related to each other. Simon and Andrew were brothers; James and John were brothers, and, if Salome was a sister of the Virgin (comp. <a href="/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>), they were first cousins of our Lord; Philip and Bartholomew may have been brothers; Thomas, Matthew, and James were perhaps brothers and first cousins of our Lord; Lebbaeus, or ‘Jude of James,’ was His second cousin; Simon Zelotes and Judas Iscariot were father and son. Thus no less than half of the Apostles would have been actually related to our Lord, although His <span class="ital">brethren</span> did not believe on Him (<a href="/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a>). The difficulty however of being <span class="ital">sure</span> of these combinations rises in part from the paucity of Jewish names, and therefore the extreme commonness of Simon, Jude, James, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>xii. The separate incidents in which individual Apostles are mentioned are as follows:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter: Prominent throughout; <a href="/luke/12-41.htm" title="Then Peter said to him, Lord, speak you this parable to us, or even to all?">Luke 12:41</a>, <a href="/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:">Luke 22:31</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-24.htm" title="And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Does not your master pay tribute?">Matthew 17:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-27.htm" title="Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what shall we have therefore?">Matthew 19:27</a>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James and John, Both prominent throughout.

Well-known and honoured names in the records of the first days.

The real name of the son of Tolmai, then, would appear to have been Nathanael. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>On the order of the names, see on <a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>.<p>Andrew<p>See on <a href="/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>.<p>James and John<p>See on <a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>.<p>Philip and Bartholomew<p>See on <a href="/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>. </body></html>
