But we must take heed that we mistake not this liberty for leave to commit sin. Christ will have us to know and remember that it is his day, therefore to be spent in his service, and to his honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Second sabbath after the first - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>. This phrase has given great perplexity to commentators. A "literal" translation would be, "on the Sabbath called "second first,"" or second first Sabbath. The word occurs nowhere else. It is therefore exceedingly difficult of interpretation. The most natural and easy explanation is that proposed by Scaliger. The "second day" of the Passover was a great festival, on which the wave-sheaf was offered, <a href="/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>. From "that day" they reckoned "seven weeks," or seven "Sabbaths," to the day of Pentecost. The "first" Sabbath after that "second day" was called the "second first," or the first from the second day of the feast. The "second" Sabbath was called the "second second," or the second Sabbath from the second day of the feast; the third the "third second," etc. This day, therefore, on which the Saviour went through the fields, was the first Sabbath that occurred after the second day of the feast.<p>Rubbing them in their hands - The word "corn" here means wheat or barley, and not maize, as in America. They rubbed it in their hands to separate the grain from the chaff. This was common and allowable. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. ii. p. 510, 511) says: "I have often seen my muleteers, as we passed along the wheat fields, pluck off ears, rub them in their hands, and eat the grains, unroasted, just as the apostles are said to have done. This also is allowable. The Pharisees did not object to the thing itself, only to the time when it was done. They said it was not lawful to do this on the Sabbath-day. It was work forbidden by those who, through their traditions, had made man for the Sabbath, not the Sabbath for man." So Professor Hackett ("Illustrations of Scripture," p. 176, 177) says: "The incident of plucking the ears of wheat, rubbing out the kernels in their hands, and eating them <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a>, is one which the traveler sees often at present who is in Palestine at the time of the gathering of the harvest. Dr. Robinson relates the following case: 'Our Arabs were an hungered, and, going into the fields, they plucked the ears of grain and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. On being questioned, they said this was an old custom, and no one would speak against it; they were supposed to be hungry, and it was allowed as a charity.'  The Pharisees complained of the disciples for violating the Sabbath, and not any rights of property." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Lu 6:1-5.

Since the Law had said that the Jews were “to do no manner of work” on the Sabbath, the Oral Law had laid down thirty-nine principal prohibitions which were assigned to the authority of the Great Synagogue and which were called <span class="ital">abhoth</span> ‘fathers’ or chief rules. From these were deduced a vast multitude of <span class="ital">toldoth</span> ‘descendants’ or derivative rules. Now ‘reaping’ and ‘threshing’ on the sabbath day were forbidden by the <span class="ital">abhoth</span>; and by the <span class="ital">toldoth</span> it was asserted that plucking corn-ears was <span class="ital">a kind of </span>reaping, and rubbing them <span class="ital">a kind of</span> threshing. But while they paid servile attention to these trivialities the Pharisees “omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith,” <a href="/matthew/22-23.htm" title="The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,">Matthew 22:23</a>). The vitality of these artificial notions among the Jews is extraordinary. Abarbanel relates that when in 1492 the Jews were expelled from Spain, and were forbidden to enter the city of Fez lest they should cause a famine, they lived on grass; yet even in this state ‘<span class="ital">religiously avoided the violation of their sabbath by plucking the grass with their hands.,</span> To avoid this they took the much more laborious method of grovelling on their knees, and cropping it with their teeth!<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is</span>  <span class="cmt_word">not lawful to do on the</span> <span class="cmt_word">sabbath days?</span> It would seem that these Pharisees came from Jerusalem, and were no doubt privately commissioned to watch narrowly the acts of the new Teacher who was beginning to attract such general attention, and who already was openly setting at nought the numberless additions which the Jewish schools had added to the Law. Round the original "sabbath law" of Moses thirty-nine prohibitions had been laid down in the oral law; round these "thirty-nine" a vast number of smaller rules had grouped themselves. Amongst these greater and lesser sabbath restrictions were prohibitions against "reaping and threshing." Now, <span class="accented">plucking ears of corn</span> was defined to be a kind of "reaping," and <span class="accented">rubbing the ears in the hands</span> a kind of "threshing." "See," cried some of these spying Pharisees, "do thy disciples publicly break the sabbath, and dost thou not rebuke them?" The Lord's reply does not attempt to discuss what was and what was not lawful on the sabbath, but in broad terms he expounds the great doctrine respecting the significance, limits, and purpose of every law relating to outward acts, even in the event of that law having been given by God, which was not the case in the present alleged transgression. How rigidly the stricter Jews some fourteen or fifteen centuries later still kept these strained and exaggerated traditional sabbath-day restrictions, is shown in a curious anecdote of the famous Abarbanel, "when, in 1492, the Jews were expelled from Spain, and were forbidden to enter the city of Fez, lest they should cause a famine, they lived on grass; yet even in this state '<span class="accented">religiously avoided the violation of their sabbath by plucking the grass with their hands.</span> To avoid this they took the much more laborious method of grovelling on their knees, and cropping it with their teeth!" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Not lawful<p>See on <a href="/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2</a>. </body></html>
