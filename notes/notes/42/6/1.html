Its employment by St. Luke may be noted as indicating his wish to be accurate as an historian. He sought to gather, as far as he could, definite dates; and hearing, in the course of his inquiries, of this, as fixing the time of what followed, inserted it in his record.<p>It may be noted that the facts of the case fix limits on either side. The corn was ripe enough to be rubbed in the hands, and yield its grain. It had not yet been gathered. It could not therefore be much earlier than the Passover, when the barley harvest began, and not much later than the Pentecost, when the wheat was ripe. If it preceded, as it appears to have done (see <a href="/luke/9-12.htm" title="And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.">Luke 9:12</a>), the feeding of the Five Thousand, it must have been before the Passover (<a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>). The conjectures, such as they are, are as follows:—<p>(1.) The <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath of the <span class= "ital">second</span> month of the year, taking Nisan (in which the Passover occurred) as the first month.<p>(2.) The <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath after the <span class= "ital">second</span> day of the Passover, that day being itself kept as a supplementary feast.<p>(3.) The <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath in the <span class= "ital">second</span> year of the sabbatic cycle of seven years.<p>(4.) As the Jewish year had two beginnings, one (the civil) reckoning from the month Tisri (including part of September and October); the other (the ecclesiastical) from Nisan, it has been supposed that the first Sabbath in Tisri was called <span class= "ital">first-first,</span> the first in Nisan <span class= "ital">second-first.</span><p>(5.) The Sabbath in the Pentecostal week, the <span class= "ital">second chief</span> or <span class= "ital">first</span> Sabbath, as that in the Passover week was the first.<p>(6.) The day after the new moon, when, through some accident, its appearance had not been reported to the Sanhedrin in time for the sacrifice connected with it. In such a case the second day was kept as the monthly feast, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> received the honours of the first, and so might come to be known technically as the <span class= "ital">second-first.</span> If it coincided, as often it must have done, with the actual Sabbath, such a day might naturally be called a <span class= "ital">second-first Sabbath.</span><p>In the total dearth of information it is impossible to speak decisively in favour of any one of these views. The last has the merit of at least suggesting the way in which St. Luke may have become acquainted with so peculiar a term. We know from Jewish writers in the Mishna that the new-moon feast was determined by the personal observation of watchmen appointed by the Sanhedrin, and not by astronomical calculation, and it was when they failed to observe or report it in time that the rule stated above came into play. We know from <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>, that the observance of that feast had risen into a new prominence in the ritual of a sect which there is every reason to identify with that of the Essenes. (See Note on <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>.) Among those whom St. Luke seems to have known at Antioch we find the name of Manaen, or Menahem, the foster-brother of Herod the Tetrarch (<a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>), presumably, as many commentators have suggested, the son or grandson of Menahem, an Essene prophet, who had predicted the future sovereignty of Herod the Great. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) In this way, accordingly, if such a technical nomenclature were in use, as it was likely to be among the Essenes, St. Luke was likely to hear it. We may add further, that Manaen, from his position, was likely to have been brought into contact with the Baptist; that he could scarcely fail to have been impressed with a life which was so entirely moulded, outwardly at least, on the Essene type; and must have passed through the teaching of John to that of Christ. We find this incident following in immediate sequence upon one in which the disciples of John were prominent (<a href="/luke/5-33.htm" title="And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but your eat and drink?">Luke 5:33</a>). May we not think therefore, with some reason, of Manaen having been among them, and of his having supplied St. Luke with the technical term that fixed the very day of the journey through the corn-fields? Combining this view with the fact that if this were a new-moon Sabbath it must have been the beginning of the moon of Nisan, possibly coinciding with an actual Sabbath, we have the interesting fact that the lesson for the first Sabbath in that month, in the modern Jewish calendar, is from 1 Samuel 21, and so contained the history of the shewbread to which our Lord refers. This coincidence, corresponding with what we find in the synagogue discourses of <a href="/luke/4-17.htm" title="And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,">Luke 4:17</a>, and of <a href="/acts/13-15.htm" title="And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.">Acts 13:15</a> (where see Note), is another confirmation of the view now maintained.<p>It remains to add that one group of MSS. of high authority omit the perplexing word, and that some critics hold it to have grown out of an original “on the first Sabbath,” as contrasted with the “other Sabbath” of <a href="/luke/6-6.htm" title="And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.">Luke 6:6</a>; and suppose that an ignorant scribe corrected this in the margin to “second,” and that one still more ignorant combined the two readings. These arbitrary conjectures are, however, eminently unscholarly; and the very difficulty presented by the word must, on all usual laws of textual criticism, be admitted as an argument for its genuineness.<p><span class= "bld">He went through the corn-fields.</span>—See for the narrative that follows Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.">Matthew 12:1-8</a>, <a href="/context/mark/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.">Mark 2:23-28</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Plucked the ears of corn, and did eat.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">were plucking, and were eating.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands....">Luke 6:1-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">On the second sabbath after the first </span>— The original expression here, <span class="greekheb">εν Σαββατω δευτεροπρωτω</span>, says Dr. Whitby, “should have been rendered, <span class="ital">In the first sabbath after the second day, </span>namely, of unleavened bread; for, after the first day of the passover, (which was a sabbath, <a href="/exodus/12-16.htm" title="And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.">Exodus 12:16</a>,) ye shall count unto you (said God) seven sabbaths complete, <a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm" title="And you shall count to you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:">Leviticus 23:15</a>, reckoning that day for the first of the week, which was therefore called, <span class="greekheb">δευτεροπρωτον</span>, <span class="ital">the first sabbath </span>from this second day of unleavened bread; (the 16th of the month;) the second was called <span class="greekheb">δευτεροδευτερον</span>, the second sabbath from that day; and the third, <span class="greekheb">δευτεροτριτον</span>, the third sabbath from that second day; and so on, till they came to the seventh sabbath from that day; that is, to the forty-ninth day, which was the day of pentecost. The mention of the seven sabbaths, to be numbered with relation to this second day, answers all that Grotius objects against this exposition. Epiphanius expressly says, Our Lord’s disciples did what is here recorded, <span class="greekheb">τω σαββατω</span>, <span class="greekheb">τω μετα την ημεραν των αζυμων</span>, on <span class="ital">the sabbath following the </span>[second] <span class="ital">day of unleavened bread. </span>And if pentecost was called the feast of harvest, <a href="/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>, (as Bochart, Mr. Mede, Dr. Lightfoot, and the Jews say,) because then their barley and wheat harvest was gathered in, this feast could not be pentecost, as Grotius conjectures, because then the corn must have been gathered in, and therefore could not have been plucked by Christ’s disciples in the field.” There are other expositions of the phrase, but this seems by far the most probable. <span class="ital">He went through the corn-fields,</span> &c. This paragraph is largely explained in the notes on <a href="/context/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat....">Matthew 12:1-8</a>; and <a href="/context/mark/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn....">Mark 2:23-28</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 Christ justifies his disciples in a work of necessity for themselves on the sabbath day, and that was plucking the ears of corn when they were hungry. But we must take heed that we mistake not this liberty for leave to commit sin. Christ will have us to know and remember that it is his day, therefore to be spent in his service, and to his honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Second sabbath after the first - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>. This phrase has given great perplexity to commentators. A "literal" translation would be, "on the Sabbath called "second first,"" or second first Sabbath. The word occurs nowhere else. It is therefore exceedingly difficult of interpretation. The most natural and easy explanation is that proposed by Scaliger. The "second day" of the Passover was a great festival, on which the wave-sheaf was offered, <a href="/leviticus/23-11.htm">Leviticus 23:11</a>. From "that day" they reckoned "seven weeks," or seven "Sabbaths," to the day of Pentecost. The "first" Sabbath after that "second day" was called the "second first," or the first from the second day of the feast. The "second" Sabbath was called the "second second," or the second Sabbath from the second day of the feast; the third the "third second," etc. This day, therefore, on which the Saviour went through the fields, was the first Sabbath that occurred after the second day of the feast.<p>Rubbing them in their hands - The word "corn" here means wheat or barley, and not maize, as in America. They rubbed it in their hands to separate the grain from the chaff. This was common and allowable. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. ii. p. 510, 511) says: "I have often seen my muleteers, as we passed along the wheat fields, pluck off ears, rub them in their hands, and eat the grains, unroasted, just as the apostles are said to have done. This also is allowable. The Pharisees did not object to the thing itself, only to the time when it was done. They said it was not lawful to do this on the Sabbath-day. It was work forbidden by those who, through their traditions, had made man for the Sabbath, not the Sabbath for man." So Professor Hackett ("Illustrations of Scripture," p. 176, 177) says: "The incident of plucking the ears of wheat, rubbing out the kernels in their hands, and eating them <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a>, is one which the traveler sees often at present who is in Palestine at the time of the gathering of the harvest. Dr. Robinson relates the following case: 'Our Arabs were an hungered, and, going into the fields, they plucked the ears of grain and did eat, rubbing them in their hands. On being questioned, they said this was an old custom, and no one would speak against it; they were supposed to be hungry, and it was allowed as a charity.'  The Pharisees complained of the disciples for violating the Sabbath, and not any rights of property." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>Lu 6:1-5.

On the fourteenth day of the first month, at evening, began the passover; on the fifteenth day began their feast of unleavened bread, which held seven days, every one of which was called a sabbath; but the first day and the seventh day were to be days of holy convocation, in which no work was to be done that was servile, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/23-7.htm" title="In the first day you shall have an holy convocation: you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:7</a></span>.

It is very hard to resolve, and not material for us to know.

Or "second first sabbath", concerning which interpreters are greatly divided. Some think, that it was either the seventh day of the feast of unleavened bread, or the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles. Others, that it was the sabbath which fell that year on the day of Pentecost; and that as there were three grand festivals among the Jews, the feasts of passover, Pentecost, and tabernacles; so when the sabbath day fell on the feast of the passover, it was called the first prime sabbath, when on the feast of Pentecost, it was called the second prime sabbath, and when on the feast of tabernacles, the third prime sabbath. Others have been of opinion, that as the Jews had two beginnings of their year, the one on civil accounts in Tisri, the other on ecclesiastical accounts in Nisan; so the first sabbath in Tisri was called the first first sabbath, and that in Nisan, which was this, the second first sabbath: but what seems most likely is, that this sabbath was, as it may be rendered, "the first sabbath after the second"; that is, the first sabbath after the second day of the passover, when the sheaf of the firstfruits was offered, and harvest might be begun; which suits well with ears of corn being ripe at this time, which the disciples rubbed. So the Jews reckoned the seven weeks from thence to Pentecost by sabbaths; the first after the second day they called the second first, or the first after the second day; the second they called the second second; and the third was named the second third; and so on, the second fourth, the second fifth, the second sixth, and second seventh, which brought on Pentecost, when the harvest was ended. So in the Jewish liturgies, there are collects for the first sabbath after the passover, and for the second sabbath after the passover, and so on to the sabbath before Pentecost. The eastern versions, Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic, not knowing what should be meant by it, have only rendered it, "on the sabbath day", as in Mat_. 12:1. See Gill on <a href="/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>. <p>That he went through the corn fields; that is, Jesus, as the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions: <p>and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands: after they had plucked them they rubbed them in their hands to get clean off the husk or beard, that were on them, and then ate the grains. And as plucking of the ears of corn was forbidden on a sabbath day; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2</a>, so was rubbing them; though if they were rubbed before, the chaff might be blown off from them in the hand, and eat on the sabbath day: the rule is this (l); <p>"he that rubs ears of corn on the evening of the sabbath, (i.e. on the sixth day,) may blow them from hand to hand on the morrow, and eat'' <p>But the disciples both plucked them, and rubbed them, and blew away the chaff from them on the sabbath day, and therefore were complained of by the Pharisees. <p>(l) T.

Now, in those feasts which were kept over a period of many days, as the feast of tabernacles and passover, their first day and the last were very solemn; see Le 23:1-44.

According to the analogy of <span class="greekheb">δευτερέσχατος</span>, <span class="ital">penultimus</span>, Heliodorus in Soran. <span class="ital">Chirurg. vet</span>. p. 94, it might—since from <span class="greekheb">ἔσχατος</span> the reckoning must be backwards, while from <span class="greekheb">πρῶτος</span> it must be forwards, in order to get a <span class="greekheb">δεύτερος</span>—be the <span class="ital">second first, i.e.</span> the <span class="ital">second of two firsts</span>. All accurate grammatical information is wanting. As, however, if any definite Sabbaths at all had borne the name of <span class="greekheb">σάββατον δευτερόπωτον</span> (and this must be assumed, as Luke took for granted that the expression was a <span class="ital">familiar</span> one), this name would doubtless occur elsewhere (in the Old Testament, in the LXX., in Philo, Josephus, in the Talmud, etc.); but this is not the case, as the whole Greek literature has not even one instance of the peculiar word <span class="ital">in itself</span> to show;[95] as among the Synoptics it was precisely Luke that could least of all impute to his reader a knowledge of the name; and as, finally, very ancient and important authorities have not got <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΠΡΏΤῼ</span></span></span> at all in the passage before us (see the critical remarks), just as even so early an authority as Syrp. remarks in the margin: “non est in omni exemplari,”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I regard <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΠΡΏΤῼ</span></span></span> as not being genuine, although, moreover, the suspicion suggests itself that it was omitted “<span class="ital">ignoratione rei</span>” (Bengel, <span class="ital">Appar.

(5) According to the same reckoning, distinguishing the three first Sabbaths of the season between Easter and Pentecost from the rest, Redslob in the <span class="ital">Intell. Bl. der allgem. Lit. Zeit</span>., Dec. 1847, p. 570 f., says that it was the <span class="ital">second Sabbath after the second Easter day</span>, <span class="greekheb">δευτερόπρωτος</span> being equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΕΎΤΕΤΟς ΤῶΝ ΠΡΏΤΩΝ</span></span></span>, therefore about fourteen days after Easter.

I. p. 357, concludes that according to the <span class="greekheb">κήρυγμα τοῦ Πέτρου</span> (in Clem. <span class="ital">Strom</span>. vi. 5, p. 760, Pott) the Sabbath at the full moon was called <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> (a mistaken explanation of the words, see Wieseler, p. 232 f.), and hence that a <span class="ital">Sabbath at the new moon</span> was to be understood. (8) Hitzig, <span class="ital">Ostern und Pfingst</span>. p. 19 ff. (agreeing with Theophylact as to the idea conveyed by the word), conceives that it was <span class="ital">the fifteenth Nisan</span>, which, according to <a href="/leviticus/23-11.htm" title="And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.">Leviticus 23:11</a>, had been called a Sabbath, and was named <span class="greekheb">δευτερόπρ</span>., because (but see, on the other hand, Wieseler, p. 353 ff.) the fourteenth Nisan always fell on a Saturday. (9) Wieseler, <span class="ital">l.c</span>. p. 231 ff.,[99] thinks that it was the second-first Sabbath of the year in a cycle of seven years, <span class="ital">i.e. the first Sabbath of the second year in a week of years</span>. Already L. Capellus, Rhenferd, and Lampe (<span class="ital">ad Joh</span>. II. p. 5) understood it to be the first month in the year (<span class="ital">Nisan</span>), but explained the name from the fact that the year had two first Sabbaths, namely, in Tisri, when the civil year began, and in Nisan, when the ecclesiastical year began. (10) Ebrard, p. 414 f., following Krafft (<span class="ital">Chron. und Harm. d. vier Evang</span>. p. 18 f.), regards it as the <span class="ital">weekly Sabbath</span> that occurs <span class="ital">between the first and last Easter days</span> (feast-Sabbaths).

Very peculiarly Weizsäcker, p. 59, says: “that <a href="/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="/luke/4-31.htm" title="And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.">Luke 4:31</a> recounts two Sabbath narratives, and now <a href="/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a>; <a href="/luke/6-6.htm" title="And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.">Luke 6:6</a> recounts other two,” and that the Sabbath in the passage before us is therefore the <span class="ital">first</span> of this <span class="ital">second</span> series of narratives, consequently the <span class="ital">second-first</span>. But what reader would hare been able to discover this reference, especially as between <a href="/luke/4-31.htm" title="And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.">Luke 4:31</a> and <a href="/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a> so many other narratives intervened?

But it is omitted in the important group [58] [59] [60], and in other good documents, and this fact, combined with the extreme unlikelihood of Lk.’s using a word to which it is now, and must always have been, impossible to attach any definite sense, makes it highly probable that this word is simply a marginal gloss, which found its way, like many others, into the text. How the gloss arose, and what it meant for its author or authors, it is really not worth while trying to conjecture, though such attempts have been made. <span class="ital">Vide</span> Tischendorf, N.

St Luke gives this unique note of time without a word to explain it, and scholars have not—and probably never will—come to an agreement as to its exact meaning. The only analogy to the word is the <span class="ital">deuterodekate</span> or second tenth in Jerome on Ezekiel 45. Of the ten or more suggested explanations, omitting those which are wholly arbitrary and impossible, we may mention the following,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a. The first Sabbath of the second month (Wetstein).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b. The first Sabbath after the second day of the Passover (Scaliger, Ewald, De Wette, Neander, Keim, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>c. The first Sabbath of the second year in the Sabbatic cycle of seven years. (Wieseler).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>d. The first Sabbath of the <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical year.</span> The Jewish year had two beginnings, the civil year began in Tisri (mid-September); the ecclesiastical year in Nisan (mid-March).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first-first Sabbath <span class="ital">may</span> therefore have been a name given to the first Sabbath of the civil year in autumn; and second-first to the first Sabbath of the ecclesiastical year in spring (Cappell, Godet).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>d. The Pentecostal Sabbath—the Paschal Sabbath being regarded as the protoproton or <span class="ital">first-first</span> (Corn. a Lapide).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These and similar explanations must be left as unsupported conjectures in the absence of any decisive trace of such Sabbatical nomenclature among the Jews. But we may remark that<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) The reading itself cannot be regarded as absolutely certain, since it is <span class="ital">omitted</span> in <span class="greekheb">א</span>, B, L, and in several important versions, including the Syriac and Coptic. Hence of modern editors Tregelles and Meyer omit it; Lachmann and Alford put it in brackets. [Its insertion may then be conceivably accounted for by marginal annotations. Thus if a copyist put ‘first’ in the margin with the reference to the <span class="ital">“other” </span>Sabbath of <a href="/luke/5-6.htm" title="And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.">Luke 5:6</a> it would have been corrected by some succeeding copyist into ‘second’ with reference to <a href="/luke/4-31.htm" title="And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.">Luke 4:31</a>; and the two may have been combined in hopeless perplexity. If it be said that this is unlikely, it seems at least equally unlikely that it should either wilfully or accidentally have been omitted if it formed part of the original text. And why should St Luke writing for Gentiles use without explanation a word to them perfectly meaningless and so highly technical that in all the folio volumes of Jewish literature there is not a single trace of it?]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) The exact discovery of what the word means is only important as a matter of archaeology. Happily there can be no question as to the time of year at which the incident took place. The narrative seems to imply that the ears which the disciples plucked and rubbed were ears of <span class="ital">wheat</span> not of <span class="ital">barley.</span> Now the first ripe sheaf of barley was offered at the Passover (in spring) and the first ripe wheat sheaf at Pentecost (fifty days later). Wheat would ripen earlier in the rich deep hollow of Gennesareth. In any case therefore the time of year was spring or early summer, and the Sabbath (whether the reading be correct or not) was probably some Sabbath in the month Nisan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he went through the corn fields</span>] Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat....">Matthew 12:1-8</a>; <a href="/context/mark/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn....">Mark 2:23-28</a>.

This <span class="greekheb">δευτερόπρωτον Σάββατον</span> here marks the second main division of the Gospel History, and the opening of the second year in our Lord’s ministry.—ED. and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> <span class="accented">- The Lord's teaching on the question of the observance of the sabbath.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first</span>. The expression accompanying this note of time of St. Luke, "the second sabbath after the first," more literally, "the second-first sabbath," has always been a difficulty with expositors of this Gospel. The word is absolutely unique, and is found in no other Greek author. Recent investigations in the text of the New Testament have proved that this word is not found in the majority of the more ancient authorities. Of the modern critical editors, Alford and Lachmann enclose the disputed word in brackets; Tregelles and Meyer omit it altogether; but the Revisers of the English Version relegate it to the margin in its literal form, "second-first;" Tischendorf alone admits it in his text. The question is of interest to the antiquarian, but scarcely of any to the theologian. It was, perhaps, introduced at an early date into many of the manuscripts of St. Luke, owing to some copyist writing n the margin of his parchment in this place "first" to distinguish <span class="accented">this</span> sabbath and its scene from the <span class="accented">other</span> sabbath alluded to four verses further on; "second" was not unlikely to have been written in correction of "first" by some other copyist using the manuscript, thinking it better thus to distinguish this from the sabbath alluded to in <a href="/luke/4-31.htm">Luke 4:31</a>; and thus the two corrections may have got confused in many of the primitive copies. It can scarcely be imagined, if it really formed part of the original work of St. Luke, that so remarkable a word could ever have dropped out of the text of the most ancient and trustworthy authorities. Supposing it to have been a part of the original writing, scholars have suggested many explanations. Of these the simplest and most satisfactory are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The first sabbath of each of the seven years which made a sabbatic cycle was called first, second, third, etc., sabbath. Thus the "second-first" sabbath would signify the first sabbath of the second year of the seven-years' cycle. This is Wieseler's theory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The civil year of the Jews began in autumn about mid-September to mid-October (month Tisri), and the ecclesiastical year in spring, about mid-March to mid-April (month Nisan). Thus there were every year two first sabbaths - one at the commencement of the civil year, which would be called '<span class="accented">first-first</span>;' the other at the beginning of the ecclesiastical year, which would be called '<span class="accented">second-first.</span> The period here alluded to by St. Luke would perfectly agree with either of these explanations. The latter theory was suggested by Louis Cappel, and is quoted with approval by Godet. <span class="cmt_word">And his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands</span>. St. Matthew adds here that they "were an hungred." This they might well have been in following the Master in his teaching in different places, even though some of their homes were nigh at hand. We have no need to introduce the question of their poverty - which, in the case of several of them at least, we know did not exist - here leading them to this method of satisfying their hunger. They had probably been out for some hours with Jesus without breaking their fast, and, finding themselves in a field of ripe corn, took this easy, present means of gratifying a natural want. The Law expressly permitted them to do this: "When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand" (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The second after the first (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
