We ought to be very careful when we blame others; for we need allowance ourselves. If we are of a giving and a forgiving spirit, we shall ourselves reap the benefit. Though full and exact returns are made in another world, not in this world, yet Providence does what should encourage us in doing good. Those who follow the multitude to do evil, follow in the broad way that leads to destruction. The tree is known by its fruits; may the word of Christ be so grafted in our hearts, that we may be fruitful in every good word and work. And what the mouth commonly speaks, generally agrees with what is most in the heart. Those only make sure work for their souls and eternity, and take the course that will profit in a trying time, who think, speak, and act according to the words of Christ. Those who take pains in religion, found their hope upon Christ, who is the Rock of Ages, and other foundation can no man lay. In death and judgment they are safe, being kept by the power of Christ through faith unto salvation, and they shall never perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A parable - A proverb or similitude.<p>Can the blind lead the blind? - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. Can the blind, &c.&#8212;not in the Sermon on the Mount, but recorded by Matthew in another and very striking connection (Mt 15:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">a parable</span> here is to be understood a proverbial saying, which hath some darkness in it, as being brought to express or signify more than the words naturally do express. Proverbial speeches are applicable to more things, and in more cases, than one. Nor is it to be expected, that in all that the evangelists give us an account of, as to the sayings of Christ, we should be able to find out an evident connexion. They, questionless, wrote much at least from their memories, and set down many sayings without respect to the time when our Saviour spake them, or the matter of his discourse immediately preceding them. We need not therefore be careful to make out the connexion of these words of his with what was before set down. In the parallel text, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/15-14.htm" title="Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.">Matthew 15:14</a></span>, our Saviour plainly applies these words with reference to the scribes and Pharisees, the Jewish leaders, their doctors and teachers at that time, who themselves being ignorant of the true sense of the Divine law, were not like very well to guide others, but with them to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fall into the ditch, </span> that is, into ruin and destruction: from whence a very probable connexion of them here with what went before may be observed; for, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/5-1.htm" title="And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came to him:...">Matthew 5:1-48</a></span>, he had in the preceding verses given an interpretation of that law of God, <span class="ital">Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, </span> much different from what the Pharisees had given of it, who had expounded it, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/5-43.htm" title="You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.">Matthew 5:43</a></span>, <span class="ital">Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy; </span> making a great many branches of love to men more than they made. Now, (saith he), this is the will, this is the law, of my heavenly Father. The scribes and Pharisees, your present doctors and teachers, go much below this; but listen not to them, if you mind to please God; themselves are blind, and know not the will of God, and if you follow them what can you expect more than such an event as where one blind man leads another? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he spake a parable unto them,.... The Vulgate Latin reads, "he spake also a parable unto them"; besides what he said; and the Arabic version renders it, "another similitude", parable, or proverb, distinct from the comparisons, allusions, and proverbial expressions in the preceding verses. Though it should be observed, that these words were not spoken at the same time, nor on the mount, as the foregoing were; but this, and what follow, are a collection of various expressions of Christ at different times, some delivered on the mount, and others elsewhere; unless it should be rather thought, that these proverbs and sentences were repeated at different places and times, which is not improbable: <p>can the blind lead the blind? they may do so, as the blind Scribes and Pharisees led the blind people of the Jews, which is what our Lord intends; but if they do, as they did, <p>shall they not both fall into the ditch? yes, verily, what else can be expected?

St. Luke closes his report of the great sermon with four little parables taken from everyday life. With these pictures drawn from common life, the Master purposed to bring home to the hearts of the men and women listening to him the solemn warnings he had just been enunciating. They - if they would be his followers - must indeed refrain from ever setting up themselves as judges of others. "See," he went on to say, "I will show you what ruin this wicked, ungenerous practice will result in: listen to me." <span class="cmt_word">Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</span> It is not improbable that some of the links in the Master's argument here have been omitted by St. Luke; still, the connection of this saying and what follows, with the preceding grave warning against the bitter censorious spirit which had exercised so fatal an influence on religious teaching in Israel, is clear. The figure of <span class="accented">the blind man</span> setting himself up as a guide was evidently in the Lord's mind as a fair representation of the present thought-leaders of the people (the Pharisees). This is evident from the imagery of the beam and mote which follows (vers. 41, 42). Can these blind guides lead others more ignorant and blind too? What is the natural result? he asks; will not destruction naturally overtake the blind leader and the blind led? Both will, of course, end by falling into the ditch. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Can the blind (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)?<p>The interrogative particle expects a negative reply.
