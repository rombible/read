In St. Matthew the proverb comes into the Sermon on the Mount; in St. Mark it occupies a position analogous to that in which it stands here, and this agreement favours the view that it was actually spoken in connection with the interpretation of the parable, as a special application of what had before been stated generally.<p>Note St. Luke’s more general term, “a vessel,” instead of “the bushel,” as in St. Matthew and St. Mark, and the somewhat wider range of the lamp’s illumining power, not only to those who are “in the house,” but to those also who are in the act of “entering” into it. We may, perhaps, venture to connect the choice of the latter phrase with St. Luke’s personal experience as a convert from heathenism. As such, he had been among those that entered into the house; and as he did so, he had seen the light of the lamp which the Apostles of Christ had lighted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/8-16.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light....">Luke 8:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, </span>&c. — See on <a href="/matthew/5-15.htm" title="Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all that are in the house.">Matthew 5:15</a>; and <a href="/mark/4-21.htm" title="And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?">Mark 4:21</a>. <span class="ital">Nothing is secret, </span>&c. — See on <a href="/matthew/10-26.htm" title="Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.">Matthew 10:26</a>. <span class="ital">Take heed, therefore, how ye hear. </span>In <a href="/mark/4-24.htm" title="And he said to them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given.">Mark 4:24</a>, it is, <span class="ital">Take heed what you hear. </span>As it is the indispensable duty of all ministers of the Word to take heed what they preach, 1st, That their doctrine be <span class="ital">true, </span>that they may not deceive their hearers. 2d, That it be <span class="ital">important, </span>that they may not trifle with them: and, 3d, That it be suitable to their state and character; that they rightly divide the word of truth, and give to every description of hearers their portion of meat in due season; so it concerns all hearers to <span class="ital">take heed what they hear. </span>They must not take it for granted that what they hear is <span class="ital">true, important, </span>and <span class="ital">suited </span>to their <span class="ital">state </span>and <span class="ital">character: </span>but must bring it to the test of the Holy Scriptures, and examine it thereby; and for that purpose, must endeavour to make themselves well acquainted with the Scriptures: and if they find that, according to the divine oracles, the doctrine which they hear answers the above description, they must so <span class="ital">take heed what they hear, </span>as to attend to, and consider it well, that they may thoroughly understand and lay it to heart, and that it may have its designed effect upon their spirit and conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, according to Luke here, our Lord’s caution, inferred from the preceding parable, implied another thing equally important, <span class="ital">Take heed how ye hear </span>— 1st, That you do not hear so inattentively, and in such a prayerless state of mind, as not to <span class="ital">understand, </span>nor afterward meditate on what your hear, and so <span class="ital">receive the seed as by the way-side. </span>See on <a href="/matthew/13-19.htm" title="When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart.

Happy are we, and for ever indebted to free grace, if the same thing that is a parable to others, with which they are only amused, is a plain truth to us, by which we are taught and governed. We ought to take heed of the things that will hinder our profiting by the word we hear; to take heed lest we hear carelessly and slightly, lest we entertain prejudices against the word we hear; and to take heed to our spirits after we have heard the word, lest we lose what we have gained. The gifts we have, will be continued to us or not, as we use them for the glory of God, and the good of our brethren. Nor is it enough not to hold the truth in unrighteousness; we should desire to hold forth the word of life, and to shine, giving light to all around.

The best comment on this verse is <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm" title="You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.">Matthew 5:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>, “Ye are the light of the world....Let your light so shine before men, &c.” John the Baptist is compared to ‘a lamp kindled and shining,’ and here the disciples are compared to it. Christ lighted the flame in their souls to be a beacon to all the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">setteth it on a candlestick</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">places it on a lamp-stand.</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/8-16.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.">Luke 8:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ φῶς</span>) <span class="ital">the light</span>, not the candlestick [or lamp which holds the light, <span class="greekheb">λύχνον</span>]. Man’s nature no more has light of itself [derived from itself], than the material of the candlestick has it. For this light is added from without, that is, by Divine agency, through the word. Therefore the candlestick does not seek to be beheld, as far as itself is concerned, but serves that the light may be beheld: and the good hearer, like the candlestick, always hears in such a way as that he may be of use to as many as possible by his shining: and he himself, in turn, day by day increases in the brightness of his shining.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">solemn conclusion of the Lord's to his exposition of his first great parable.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light</span>. The meaning of the Lord's saying here is - the disciples must not look on this parable-method of teaching, which from henceforth he purposed frequently to adopt, as mysterious, or as containing anything beyond ordinary human comprehension. The explanation of "the sower," which he  had just given them, showed them how really simple and adapted to everyday life his teaching was. "No man," said the Lord, "when he hath lighted the candle of the true knowledge, really wishes to hide it - he rather displays it that men may see the light; and that is what I have been doing for you in my careful explanation of my story." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Candle (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., properly, lamp.
