Happy are we, and for ever indebted to free grace, if the same thing that is a parable to others, with which they are only amused, is a plain truth to us, by which we are taught and governed. We ought to take heed of the things that will hinder our profiting by the word we hear; to take heed lest we hear carelessly and slightly, lest we entertain prejudices against the word we hear; and to take heed to our spirits after we have heard the word, lest we lose what we have gained. The gifts we have, will be continued to us or not, as we use them for the glory of God, and the good of our brethren. Nor is it enough not to hold the truth in unrighteousness; we should desire to hold forth the word of life, and to shine, giving light to all around. Great encouragement is given to those who prove themselves faithful hearers of the word, by being doers of the work.

He is not thinking of the discovery of crimes, but of the right use and further dissemination of divine light. The truths now revealed privately to them, and only dimly shadowed forth to others, should soon be flashed over all the world. Parables first yielded their full significance to the disciples, but found “a springing and germinant fulfilment in every age.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/8-17.htm" title="For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.">Luke 8:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) The light even now already loves to be seen, because it is about to be wholly revealed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For nothing is secret, that shall net be made manifest; neither anything hid, that shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be known and come abroad.</span> "All will gradually become clear to them. Whilst the night thickens over Israel on account of its unbelief, the disciples will advance into even fuller light, until there is nothing left in the plan of God which is obscure or hidden. The heart of Jesus is lifted up at this prospect. This accounts for the poetical rhythm which always appears at such moments" (Godet). This is very good, but Godet scarcely goes far enough. The Master's words surely promise that, as the ages advance, more and ever more light on the subject of God's dealings with men will be vouchsafed to the humble, patient searcher after the Divine wisdom. This apophthegm seems to have been a very favourite one of our Lord; he evidently used it on several occasions (see, for instance, <a href="/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>, where the same words are reported to have been spoken in a different connection). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Nothing is secret - manifest<p>Correctly rendered in A.
