There is no relief for souls under a sense of guilt, and fear of wrath, but to go to Christ, and call him Master, and say, I am undone, if thou dost not help me. When our dangers are over, it becomes us to take to ourselves the shame of our own fears, and to give Christ the glory of our deliverance. We may learn much out of this history concerning the world of infernal, malignant spirits, which though not working now exactly in the same way as then, yet all must at all times carefully guard against. And these malignant spirits are very numerous. They have enmity to man and all his comforts. Those under Christ's government are sweetly led with the bands of love; those under the devil's government are furiously driven. Oh what a comfort it is to the believer, that all the powers of darkness are under the control of the Lord Jesus! It is a miracle of mercy, if those whom Satan possesses, are not brought to destruction and eternal ruin. Christ will not stay with those who slight him; perhaps he may no more return to them, while others are waiting for him, and glad to receive him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23-34</a> notes, and <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1-20</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 8:26-39.
