Happy are we, and for ever indebted to free grace, if the same thing that is a parable to others, with which they are only amused, is a plain truth to us, by which we are taught and governed. We ought to take heed of the things that will hinder our profiting by the word we hear; to take heed lest we hear carelessly and slightly, lest we entertain prejudices against the word we hear; and to take heed to our spirits after we have heard the word, lest we lose what we have gained. The gifts we have, will be continued to us or not, as we use them for the glory of God, and the good of our brethren. Nor is it enough not to hold the truth in unrighteousness; we should desire to hold forth the word of life, and to shine, giving light to all around. Great encouragement is given to those who prove themselves faithful hearers of the word, by being doers of the work.

This would have been to put the kindled lamp under a couch or a bushel. On the contrary they were addressed to the multitudes, and deeply impressed them, as they have impressed the world in all ages, and have had the effect, not of darkening truth but of bringing it into brighter light. The varying phrase of St Matthew, “<span class="ital">because</span> seeing they see not, &c.,” will help us to understand it. Our Lord <span class="ital">wished</span> and <span class="ital">meant</span> the multitudes to hearken and understand, and this method awoke their interest and deepened their attention; but the resultant profit <span class="ital">depended solely on the degree of their faithfulness.</span> The Parables resembled the Pillar of Fire, which was to others a Pillar of Cloud. If they listened with mere intellectual curiosity or hardened prejudice they would only carry away the parable itself, or some complete misapplication of its least essential details; to get at its real meaning required self-examination and earnest thought. Hence parables had a blinding and hardening effect on the false and the proud and the wilful, just as prophecy had in old days (<a href="/context/isaiah/6-9.htm" title="And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not....">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, quoted in this connexion in <a href="/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14</a>, comp. <a href="/context/acts/28-26.htm" title="Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:...">Acts 28:26-27</a>; <a href="/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a>). But the Prophecy and the Parable did not <span class="ital">create</span> the hardness or stolidity, but only educed it when it existed—<span class="ital">as all misused blessings and privileges do.</span> It was only <span class="ital">unwillingness to see</span> which was punished by <span class="ital">incapacity of seeing.</span> The natural punishment of spiritual perversity is spiritual blindness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nothing can be better than the profound remark of Lord Bacon, that “a Parable has a double use; it tends to <span class="ital">vail</span>, and it tends to <span class="ital">illustrate </span>a truth; in the latter case it seems designed to teach, in the former to conceal.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Though truths in manhood darkly join,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Deep seated in our mystic frame,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We yield all blessing to the name<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of Him who made them current coin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For Wisdom dealt with mortal powers,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Where truth in closest words shall fail,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When truth embodied in a tale<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Shall enter in at lowly doors.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">The seed is the word of God</span>] We have the same metaphor in <a href="/context/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;...">Colossians 1:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>; and a <span class="ital">similar</span> one in <a href="/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">James 1:21</a>, “the <span class="ital">engrafted </span>word;” <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/9-31.htm" title="For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever.">2Es 9:31</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/9-33.htm" title="Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.">2Es 9:33</a>, “Behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you...yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-15.</span> <span class="accented">-  The Lord's interpretation of the parable of the sower.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seed is the Word of God.</span> It was his own sad experience the Master was relating.
