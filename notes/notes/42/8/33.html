There is no relief for souls under a sense of guilt, and fear of wrath, but to go to Christ, and call him Master, and say, I am undone, if thou dost not help me. When our dangers are over, it becomes us to take to ourselves the shame of our own fears, and to give Christ the glory of our deliverance. We may learn much out of this history concerning the world of infernal, malignant spirits, which though not working now exactly in the same way as then, yet all must at all times carefully guard against. And these malignant spirits are very numerous. They have enmity to man and all his comforts. Those under Christ's government are sweetly led with the bands of love; those under the devil's government are furiously driven. Oh what a comfort it is to the believer, that all the powers of darkness are under the control of the Lord Jesus! It is a miracle of mercy, if those whom Satan possesses, are not brought to destruction and eternal ruin. Christ will not stay with those who slight him; perhaps he may no more return to them, while others are waiting for him, and glad to receive him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23-34</a> notes, and <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1-20</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 8:26-39.

If it be asked whether this was not a destruction of property, the answer is that the antedating of the death of a herd of unclean animals was nothing compared with the deliverance of a human soul. Our Lord would therefore have had a moral right to act thus even if he had been a mere human Prophet. Besides, to put it on the lowest ground, the freeing of the neighbourhood from the peril and terror of this wild maniac was a greater benefit to the whole city than the loss of this herd. Jesus did not <span class="ital">command</span> the spirits to go into the swine; if He <span class="ital">permitted</span> any thing which resulted in their destruction it was to serve higher and more precious ends. “God the Word,” says Lord Bacon, “wished to do nothing which breathed not of grace and beneficence;” and after mentioning the stern miracles of Moses, Elijah, Elisha, St Peter and St Paul, he adds, “but Jesus did nothing of this kind...the spirit of Jesus is the spirit of the Dove. He wrought no miracle of judgment, all of beneficence.” <span class="ital">Meditt.

But it seems better to see, in the permitted destruction of the herd, the Lord's grave rebuke to the open disregarders of the holy ritual law of Israel, for the sake of selfish lucre. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ran violently (&#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., more neatly, rushed.
