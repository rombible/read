And many a poor soul is healed, and helped, and saved by Christ, that is hidden in a crowd, and nobody notices it. This woman came trembling, yet her faith saved her. There may be trembling, where yet there is saving faith. Observe Christ's comfortable words to Jairus, Fear not, believe only, and thy daughter shall be made whole. No less hard was it not to grieve for the loss of an only child, than not to fear the continuance of that grief. But in perfect faith there is no fear; the more we fear, the less we believe. The hand of Christ's grace goes with the calls of his word, to make them effectual. Christ commanded to give her meat. As babes new born, so those newly raised from sin, desire spiritual food, that they may grow thereby.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18-26</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-43</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47. declared &#8230; before all&#8212;This, though a great trial to the shrinking modesty of the believing woman, was just what Christ wanted in dragging her forth, her public testimony to the facts of her case&#8212;both her disease, with her abortive efforts at a cure, and the instantaneous and perfect relief which her touch of the Great Healer had brought her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 47. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/8-41.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and sought him that he would come into his house:">Luke 8:41</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the woman saw that she was not hid,....
