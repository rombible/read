The two anecdotes, if we may so call them, are placed by the two Evangelists in a very different connection. It is clear that their isolated, fragmentary character, with no definite notes of time and place, left a large margin to the discretion of each compiler as to where they should appear. The difference between the “certain man” of St. Luke’s report, and the “scribe” of St. Matthew’s, slight as it is, takes its place among the signs of the mutual independence of the two Gospels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/9-57.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go....">Luke 9:57-62</a></span>. <span class="ital">And it came to pass as they went in the way </span>— This and the following seem to be the same occurrences with those mentioned by Matthew, which took place as Christ was in the neighbourhood of Capernaum, going from that town to the shore, where he proposed to embark, in order to cross the lake, and not on his way to Jerusalem through the country of the Samaritans. See notes on <a href="/context/matthew/8-19.htm" title="And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go....">Matthew 8:19-22</a>. <span class="ital">And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, </span>&c. — Jesus, knowing that the man proposed to himself riches and honours in the expected kingdom of the Messiah, thought fit to make him sensible of his mistake. As if he had said, Understand the terms: consider on what conditions thou art to follow me. <span class="ital">He said to another, Follow me </span>— About the same time, our Lord meeting with one who had often attended him, and thereby showed an inclination to become his disciple, he ordered him to disengage himself altogether from worldly affairs and follow him; <span class="ital">but he said, Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father </span>— The man excused himself on pretence that he was bound in duty to wait on an aged father, till he should pay him the last office in his burial. <span class="ital">Jesus said, Let the dead bury their dead — </span>Let those who are dead in sin, or who are so immersed in worldly affairs that they are dead to God and divine things, employ themselves in committing to the dust their deceased friends and relatives. <span class="ital">But go thou and preach the kingdom of God </span>— It is justly observed by Dr. Doddridge, that, “as our Lord called him now to follow him, we must conclude that this commission which he gives him to preach was not directly to be put in execution. The circumstance was plainly extraordinary, and might turn on reasons unknown to us. Christ might, for instance, foresee some particular obstruction that would have arisen from the interview with his friends at his father’s funeral, which would have prevented his devoting himself to the ministry; to which he might refer in saying, <span class="ital">Let the dead bury their dead.” And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee </span>— Unto a third, who of his own accord offered to follow him, if he would allow him to go home and take leave of his family, Jesus gave such an answer as teaches us that no domestic affair should hinder the care of our salvation; that the calls of religion are so very pressing, that they admit of no delay or excuse whatsoever; and that all who set themselves to seek the welfare of their souls should pursue the work assiduously, without looking carelessly around them, as if they neglected what they were doing. <span class="ital">He said unto him, No man having put his hand to the plough, &c., is fit for the kingdom of God </span>— Either to receive and become a subject of it, or to preach it. “Hesiod has given it as the character of a good ploughman, that, ‘he keeps his mind intent on his work,’ that he may make ‘a straight furrow,’ and does not allow himself ‘to gaze about on his companions.’ Our Lord, on the like obvious principles, may use the phrase of one that looks behind him while his hand is on the plough, as a kind of proverbial expression for a careless, irresolute person, who must be peculiarly unfit for the Christian ministry. How happy had it been for Christ’s church had this lively admonition been regarded, without which it is impossible, <span class="greekheb">ορθοτομειν τον λογον της αληθειας</span>, <span class="ital">to divide, </span>or rather <span class="ital">direct the word of truth aright,” </span><a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:57-62 Here is one that is forward to follow Christ, but seems to have been hasty and rash, and not to have counted the cost. If we mean to follow Christ, we must lay aside the thoughts of great things in the world. Let us not try to join the profession of Christianity, with seeking after worldly advantages. Here is another that seems resolved to follow Christ, but he begs a short delay. To this man Christ first gave the call; he said to him, Follow me. Religion teaches us to be kind and good, to show piety at home, and to requite our parents; but we must not make these an excuse for neglecting our duty to God. Here is another that is willing to follow Christ, but he must have a little time to talk with his friends about it, and to set in order his household affairs, and give directions concerning them. He seemed to have worldly concerns more upon his heart than he ought to have, and he was willing to enter into a temptation leading him from his purpose of following Christ. No one can do any business in a proper manner, if he is attending to other things. Those who begin with the work of God, must resolve to go on, or they will make nothing of it. Looking back, leads to drawing back, and drawing back is to perdition.

They evidently did not occur together, but most probably they took place about this time in the ministry. They are placed in one group as examples of the way in which the Master replied to numerous offers of service made to him under different conditions. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 57, 58.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lord, I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

St. Matthew tells us that the "certain man" who made this  offer of service was a scribe. This detail is useful, as showing that those who were attracted by our Lord's teaching were by no means confined to the peasant and artisan class. If we look a little below the surface of the gospel story, we find numberless indications of this. In the Master's reply it is probable that the depression, naturally the result of the churlish refusal of the Samaritan villagers to receive him (ver. 53), coloured the sad but true reflection. The wise Master distrusted the too-ready enthusiasm of his would-be disciple. He saw it would never stand the test of the severe privation or the painful self-sacrifice which would be the sure lot of any one, especially at that juncture, really faithful to him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A certain man<p>Matthew, a scribe.<p>Thou goest (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Lit., "goest away" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;).
