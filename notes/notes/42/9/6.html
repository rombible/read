They must not be anxious to commend themselves to people's esteem by outward appearance. They must go as they were. The Lord Jesus is the fountain of power and authority, to whom all creatures must, in one way or another, be subject; and if he goes with the word of his ministers in power, to deliver sinners from Satan's bondage, they may be sure that he will care for their wants. When truth and love thus go together, and yet the message of God is rejected and despised, it leaves men without excuse, and turns to a testimony against them. Herod's guilty conscience was ready to conclude that John was risen from the dead. He desired to see Jesus; and why did he not go and see him? Probably, because he thought it below him, or because he wished not to have any more reprovers of sin. Delaying it now, his heart was hardened, and when he did see Jesus, he was as much prejudiced against him as others, Lu 23:11.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1-14</a>.<p>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1-14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Lu 9:1-6.
