A little child is the emblem by which Christ teaches us simplicity and humility. What greater honour can any man attain to in this world, than to be received by men as a messenger of God and Christ; and to have God and Christ own themselves received and welcomed in him! If ever any society of Christians in this world, had reason to silence those not of their own communion, the twelve disciples at this time had; yet Christ warned them not to do the like again.

Yet Lk.’s expression practically means that = this child, for example.—<span class="greekheb">δέξηται</span>: in Lk. the receiving of the little child is placed first in the discourse of Jesus, whereas in Mk. the general maxim that the man who is willing to be last is first, comes first. This position favours the view that not internal rivalry but a common self-exaltation in relation to those without is the vice in the view of Lk. Jesus says in effect: Be not high-minded; an appreciative attitude towards those you are prone to despise is what I and my Father value.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν ὑμῖν</span>: this phrase, on the other hand, seems to point to internal rivalries. There had been a question among them as to greater and less, to which the Master’s answer was: the least one is the great one. Lk.’s version of this important discourse is, as De Wette remarks, inferior in point and clearness to Mt.’s.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">48</span>. <span class="ital">he that is least among you</span>] Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/23-11.htm" title="But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant....">Matthew 23:11-12</a>. He perhaps added the memorable words about offending His little ones. <a href="/context/matthew/18-6.htm" title="But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea....">Matthew 18:6-10</a>; <a href="/luke/17-2.htm" title="It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.">Luke 17:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall be great</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">is great </span>(<span class="greekheb">א</span>, B, C, L, X).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/9-48.htm" title="And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever shall receive me receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.">Luke 9:48</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) It is the part of humility to care for little children: it is the part of greatness to receive God.[86]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[86] And whoever receives a little child, Jesus saith, receiveth God.

The general lesson here - and it is one that has gone to the heart more or less of <span class="accented">all</span> professing Christians - is that all the followers of Jesus should practise humility before, and show tenderness to, the weak. It is one of the great sayings of the Master which has stirred that practical charity which has ever been one of the great characteristic features of Christianity. But while the general lesson is clear, the particular reminder still claims attention. Singular and touching was the affection of Jesus for children. Several marked instances of this are noted in the Gospels. To this passage, however, and to the sequel as reported in St. Mark (<a href="/mark/9-42.htm">Mark 9:42</a>), may be especially referred the thought which has founded the countless child-homes, schools, and hospitals in all lands in different ages, and in our own time the institution of the Sunday school, not the least beautiful of Christian works done in the Master's Name. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In my name<p>See on <a href="/matthew/18-5.htm">Matthew 18:5</a>.</body></html>
