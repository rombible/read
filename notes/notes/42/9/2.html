They must not be anxious to commend themselves to people's esteem by outward appearance. They must go as they were. The Lord Jesus is the fountain of power and authority, to whom all creatures must, in one way or another, be subject; and if he goes with the word of his ministers in power, to deliver sinners from Satan's bondage, they may be sure that he will care for their wants. When truth and love thus go together, and yet the message of God is rejected and despised, it leaves men without excuse, and turns to a testimony against them. Herod's guilty conscience was ready to conclude that John was risen from the dead. He desired to see Jesus; and why did he not go and see him? Probably, because he thought it below him, or because he wished not to have any more reprovers of sin. Delaying it now, his heart was hardened, and when he did see Jesus, he was as much prejudiced against him as others, Lu 23:11.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1-14</a>.<p>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1-14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 9<p>Lu 9:1-6.

This might have been viewed as an incidental mention of preaching as another subordinate function, but for the reference to healing (<span class="greekheb">ἰᾶσθαι</span>), which suggests that this verse is another way of stating the objects of the mission, perhaps taken from another source.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">And he sent them</span>] Two and two for their mutual comfort. <a href="/mark/6-7.htm" title="And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;">Mark 6:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to heal the sick</span>.

The practice was continued, or possibly was revived, long after the original power connected with it had ceased to exist. It still survives in the Roman Catholic Church in the sacrament of extreme unction, which, singularly enough,  is administered when all hope of the patient's recovery from the sickness is over. Anointing the sick with oil was a favourite practice among the ancient Jews (see <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a> and <a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>). It was to be used by the twelve as an ordinary medicine, possessing, however, in their hands an extraordinary effect, and was to be, during this mission, the visible medium through which the Divine influence and power to heal took effect. We never read of Jesus in <span class="accented">his</span> miracles using oil; his usual practice seems to have been simply to have used words. At times he touched the sufferer; on one occasion only we read how he mixed some clay with which he anointed the sightless eyes. </body></html>
