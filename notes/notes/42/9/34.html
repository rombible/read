Prayer is a transfiguring, transforming duty, which makes the face to shine. Our Lord Jesus, even in his transfiguration, was willing to speak concerning his death and sufferings. In our greatest glories on earth, let us remember that in this world we have no continuing city. What need we have to pray to God for quickening grace, to make us lively! Yet that the disciples might be witnesses of this sign from heaven, after awhile they became awake, so that they were able to give a full account of what passed. But those know not what they say, that talk of making tabernacles on earth for glorified saints in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Heavy with sleep - Borne down with sleep - oppressed, overcome with sleep. It may seem remarkable that they should fall asleep on such an occasion; but we are to bear in mind that this may have been in the night, and that they were weary with the toils of the day. Besides, they did not "fall asleep" while the transfiguration lasted. While Jesus was praying, or perhaps after he closed, they fell asleep. "While" they were sleeping his countenance was changed, and Moses and Elias appeared. The first that "they" saw of it was after they awoke, having been probably awakened by the shining of the light around them.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34, 35. a cloud&#8212;not one of our watery clouds, but the Shekinah-cloud (see on [1612]Mt 23:39), the pavilion of the manifested presence of God with His people, what Peter calls "the excellent" of "magnificent glory" (2Pe 1:17).<p>a voice&#8212;"such a voice," says Peter emphatically; "and this voice [he adds] we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount" (2Pe 1:17, 18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 34. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/9-2.htm" title="And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.">Luke 9:2</a>8"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>While he thus spake there came a cloud,....

This luminous cloud, bright though it was, yet veiled the more intolerable brightness within. That such a bright cloud had the power of overshadowing and concealing, is not strange, for light in its utmost intensity hides as effectually as the darkness would do. God dwells in light inaccessible, whom therefore "no man hath seen, nor can see" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). Milton writes - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Dark with excess of light."</span> Philo speaks of the highest light as identical with darkness. Anselm thus understands the cloud here, quoting the words of <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>, referred to above, and then the words of Moses, "And Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was" (<a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>), and then this passage from the Transfiguration, and comments thus: "Illa caligo et ista nubes, atque ilia lux idem sunt" (see Archbishop Trench on "Transfiguration," in 'Studies in the Gospels,' 8). The fear which these eye-witnesses remember as one of their experiences that memorable night was a very natural feeling. As the cloud stole over the mountain ridge, and the glory-light gradually paled and waned, the sensation of intense pleasure and satisfaction, which we may assume to be the natural accompaniment of such a blessed scene, would give place to awe and amazement. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A cloud<p>"A strange peculiarity has been noticed about Hermon, in the extreme rapidity of the formation of cloud on the summit.

Them (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;) must, I think, be confined to Moses, Elias, and Jesus. Grammatically, it might include all the six; but the disciples hear the voice out of the cloud, and the cloud, as a symbol of the divine presence, rests on these three as a sign to the disciples.
