The child had been rendered deaf and dumb by his possession; in the last paroxysm he wallowed on the ground foaming, and then lay as dead till Jesus raised him by the hand. Interesting parallels to these strange and horrible paroxysms in a condition which may well be ascribed to demoniac possession may be found in a paper on Demoniacs by Mr Caldwell, <span class="ital">Contemp. Rev.,</span> Feb., 1876. The boy’s ‘possession’ seems on its natural side to have been the deadliest and intensest form of epileptic lunacy which our Lord had ever healed, and one far beyond the power of the real or pretended Jewish exorcisms. Hence the words of Jesus were peculiarly emphatic, <a href="/mark/9-25.htm" title="When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him, and enter no more into him.">Mark 9:25</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father</span>. A word of the great Master was sufficient, and the spirit which had brought the cruel curse of disease and madness into the boy was cast out, and the strange cure was complete. St. Peter supplied St. Mark with fuller details here, and especially adds one priceless gem of instruction in the Christian life. The Lord told the father of the suffering child that the granting of the boon he craved for his son depended on his own faith. Then the poor father, won by the Divine goodness manifest in every act and word of Jesus, stammered out that pitiful, loving expression, re-echoed since in so many thousand hearts, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief." If he accepted and rewarded <span class="accented">that</span> trembling, wavering faith in him, will he reject mine? <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Threw him down (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on teareth, <a href="/mark/9-18.htm">Mark 9:18</a>.<p>Tare (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
