For they could not but think it a most extraordinary and marvellous thing, that Christ could not only work miracles himself, but impart the power of working them to others, even to whomsoever he pleased; a thing never heard of in the world before, and which evidently rendered him far superior to all the prophets, and certainly was an amazing and most convincing proof of his being the Messiah. This circumstance, it seems, aggrandized him more than any other thing, and spread his fame so far, that it reached the court of Herod, tetrarch of Galilee, and occasioned many speculations there. <span class="ital">And he </span>(Herod) <span class="ital">was perplexed. </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">διηπορει</span>, <span class="ital">much perplexed, </span>as the same word is rendered <a href="/luke/24-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:">Luke 24:4</a>; and by the Vulgate <span class="ital">consternatum esse, to be in a consternation; </span>and elsewhere, <span class="ital">stupere, to be amazed, </span>or <span class="ital">dismayed. </span>The word, says Grotius, signifies <span class="ital">wonder and astonishment; </span>or, according to Doddridge, “such a mixture of doubt and fear, as necessarily throws the mind into a very uneasy situation.” The sense here seems to be, that the fame of our Lord’s miracles, and the diversity of opinions concerning him, so astonished Herod that he knew not what to think or believe concerning him. <span class="ital">Because it was said of some </span>— And soon after by Herod himself; <span class="ital">that John was risen from the dead </span>— He thought he had got clear of John, and should never be more troubled with him; but he now begins to fear he was mistaken, and that either John was come to life again, or that another had arisen in his power and spirit. <span class="ital">And of some </span>(it was said) <span class="ital">that Elias had appeared </span>— They say appeared, because, as he did not die, he could not rise again: <span class="ital">and of others, that one of the old prophets </span>— Who had been persecuted and slain long since; <span class="ital">was risen again </span>— To be recompensed for his sufferings by this honour put upon him. It is probable that this conversation at the court of Galilee, concerning Jesus, and Herod’s perplexity thereupon, happened soon after the Baptist’s death. The murder of him, it seems, was recent. Hence the stings of conscience which that crime occasioned to Herod were bitter; and the rather, that he had committed it in an unguarded hour, contrary to the dictates of his own mind. Hence, in the confusion of his thoughts, he followed the multitude, though a Sadducee, in fancying that John was risen from the dead, and dreaded the punishment of his crime. It may seem strange that any person should have ascribed Christ’s miracles to John risen from the dead, who during his life-time performed no miracle, <a href="/john/5-41.htm" title="I receive not honor from men.">John 5:41</a>. Perhaps they imagined the power of working miracles was conferred on the Baptist to prove both his resurrection and his innocence; to clothe him with greater authority than formerly; and to render his person inviolable for the future. <span class="ital">Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this? </span>— Is he carrying on John’s work, or is he come to avenge John’s death? John baptized, but he does not; John wrought no miracle, but he works many; and therefore appears more formidable than John. Observe, reader, those who oppose God will find themselves more and more embarrassed. <span class="ital">And he desired to see him — </span>Whether he resembled John or not; and if he found it was John, perhaps expecting to effect a reconciliation with him. “He might soon have got his doubts resolved, if he would have informed himself, as he easily might, of what thousands knew, that Jesus preached and wrought miracles a great while before John was beheaded, and therefore could not be John risen from the dead. <span class="ital">He desired to see him </span>— And why did he not go and see him, or send for him? Probably because he thought it below him to do either the one or the other. He had had enough of John, and cared not for having to do with any more such reprovers of sin. <span class="ital">He desired to see him; </span>but we do not find that he ever did till he saw him at his bar, and then he and his men of war set him at naught, <a href="/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>. Had he prosecuted his convictions now, and gone to see him, who knows but a happy change might have been wrought in him; but delaying it now, his heart was hardened; and when he did see him, he was as much prejudiced against him as any other.” — Henry.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 Christ sent his twelve disciples abroad, who by this time were able to teach others what they had received from the Lord. They must not be anxious to commend themselves to people's esteem by outward appearance. They must go as they were. The Lord Jesus is the fountain of power and authority, to whom all creatures must, in one way or another, be subject; and if he goes with the word of his ministers in power, to deliver sinners from Satan's bondage, they may be sure that he will care for their wants. When truth and love thus go together, and yet the message of God is rejected and despised, it leaves men without excuse, and turns to a testimony against them. Herod's guilty conscience was ready to conclude that John was risen from the dead. He desired to see Jesus; and why did he not go and see him? Probably, because he thought it below him, or because he wished not to have any more reprovers of sin. Delaying it now, his heart was hardened, and when he did see Jesus, he was as much prejudiced against him as others, Lu 23:11.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1-2</a>.

This was Herod Antipas; he was a son of Herod the Great; his mother's name was Malthace. After his father's death he became tetrareh or prince-ruler of Galilee, Peraea, and of a fourth part of the Roman province of Syria. His first wife was daughter of Aretas, a famous Arabian sheik spoken of by St. Paul as "king of the Damascenes" (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>). This princess he divorced, and contracted a marriage at once incestuous and adulterous with his niece Herodias, the beautiful wife of his half-brother Philip. Philip was not a sovereign prince, and it was probably from motives of ambition that she deserted Philip for the powerful tetrarch Herod Antipas. It was owing to his fearless remonstrances against this wicked marriage that John the Baptist incurred the enmity of Herodias, who was only satisfied with the head of the daring preacher who presumed to attack her brilliant wicked life. What Herod now heard was the report of the widespread interest suddenly aroused by the mission of the twelve - a mission, we know, supported by miraculous powers, following close upon the Galilaean ministry of the Lord, which, as far as regarded the numbers who thronged his meetings, and the outward interest his words and works excited, had been so successful. Rumours of all this at last reached the court circle, wrapped up in its own selfish and often wanton pleasures and false excitement. <span class="cmt_word">Because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead.</span> Herod Antipas was probably inclined to the Sadducee creed, which believed in neither angel nor spirit. But Sadduceeism and the easy doctrines of Epicurus, which no doubt found favour in the luxurious palace of Herod, are but a flimsy protection at best against the ghastly reminiscences and the weird forebodings of a guilty conscience. The murder of John had been, Herod knew, strongly condemned by the public voice. He would not believe it was his old monitor risen, but vet the prince was anxious and perturbed in his mind. The murmur that the great prophet was Elias (Elijah) disquieted him, too. Herod could not help recalling to his mind the lifelong combat of that great and austere servant of God against another wicked sovereign and his queen, Ahab and Jezebel, whose great crime was that <span class="accented">they</span>, too, had slain the Lord's prophets. That history, Herod felt, had to some extent been reproduced by himself and Herodias. There was a rooted expectation among the Jews that Elijah would reappear again on earth, and that his appearance would herald the advent of the Messiah. There are numberless references in the Talmud to this looked-for return of the famous Elijah. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The tetrarch<p>See on <a href="/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>.<p>That was done (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)<p>The present participle.
