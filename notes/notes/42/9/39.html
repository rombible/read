Naturally, frequent in medical writers, of sudden attacks of disease. Luke has more medical details in his account than the other evangelists. He mentions the sudden coming on of the fits, and their lasting a long time. Mr. Hobart remarks that Aretaeus, a physician of Luke's time, in treating of epilepsy, admits the possibility of its being produced by demoniacal agency. Epilepsy was called by physicians "the sacred disease."<p>Bruising (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>See on bruised, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>. The word literally means crushing together. Rev. expresses the &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;, together, by sorely. Compare the details in Mark, gnashing the teeth and pining away (<a href="/mark/9-18.htm">Mark 9:18</a>). The details in <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/9-21.htm">Mark 9:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/9-22.htm">Mark 9:22</a>, we might rather expect to find in Luke; especially Christ's question, how long he had been subject to these attacks.
