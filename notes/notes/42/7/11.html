See Christ's power over death itself. The gospel call to all people, to young people particularly, is, Arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light and life. When Christ put life into him, it appeared by the youth's sitting up. Have we grace from Christ? Let us show it. He began to speak: whenever Christ gives us spiritual life, he opens the lips in prayer and praise. When dead souls are raised to spiritual life, by Divine power going with the gospel, we must glorify God, and look upon it as a gracious visit to his people. Let us seek for such an interest in our compassionate Saviour, that we may look forward with joy to the time when the Redeemer's voice shall call forth all that are in their graves. May we be called to the resurrection of life, not to that of damnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A city called Nain - This city was in Galilee, in the boundaries of the tribe of Issachar. It was about two miles south of Mount Tabor, and not far from Capernaum; It is now a small village inhabited by Jews, Muslims, and Christians. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. ii. p. 158) locates it on the northwest corner of a mount now called Jebel ed Duhy, one hour's ride from the foot of Mount Tabor. Of this place he says: "This mount is now called Jebel ed Duhy and that small hamlet on the northwest corner of it is Nain, famous for the restoration of the widow's son to life. It was once a place of considerable extent, but is now little more than a cluster of ruins, among which dwell a few families of fanatical Moslems. It is in keeping with the one historic incident that renders it dear to the Christian, that its only antiquities are tombs. These are situated mainly on the east of the village, and it was in that direction, I presume, that the widow's son was being carried on that memorable occasion. It took me just an hour to ride from the foot of Tabor to Nain." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 7:11-17. Widow of Nain's Son Raised to Life. (In Luke only).<p>11. Nain&#8212;a small village not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and only this once probably visited by our Lord; it lay a little to the south of Mount Tabor, about twelve miles from Capernaum.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 11-15. Luke alone gives us an account of this miracle of our Saviour’s. Matthew mentions only the raising from the dead of Jairus’s daughter. Luke adds this. John adds that of Lazarus, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/11-57.htm" title="Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.">John 11:57</a></span>, by which our Lord did mightily show his Divine power, and gave us some firstfruits of the more general resurrection, as well as declared himself to be, as he elsewhere saith, the resurrection and the life. The place where this miracle was done was called <span class="ital">Nain</span>. H. Stephen Heb., Chald., Gr. et Lat. <span class="ital">nomina, </span>& c., tells us, it was a city or town about two miles from Mount Tabor, at the foot of the lesser Mount Hermon, near to Hendor. It was the custom of the Jews to bury their dead without their cities. Christ met this dead body carrying out. He was it seems her only child, and she was a widow, so under a great affliction, God by this providence having quenched the only coal she had left in Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And when the Lord saw her</span>, (the text saith), <span class="bld">he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</span> None moved him on the behalf of the widow, neither do we read that she herself spake to him; only our Saviour’s bowels were moved at the sight of her sorrow, and consideration of her loss. It is observable that our Saviour wrought his healing miracles: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Sometimes at the motion and desire of the parties to be healed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Sometimes at the desires of others on their behalf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Sometimes of his own free motion, neither themselves nor others soliciting him for any such act of mercy toward them; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and that in the three first miracles, (of which Matthew and Luke give us an account here and <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/8-1.htm" title="When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him....">Matthew 8:1-34</a></span>), which he wrought after his famous sermon on the mount, he gave us an instance of all these, in his healing of the leper personally beseeching him, of the centurion’s servant at the entreaty of the elders of the Jews, and of the widow’s son here, upon his sight of the woman’s affliction, none soliciting him. Thereby showing us that we ought not to stay our hand from doing good when we have proper objects and opportunities before us, until we be importuned and solicited there unto. Christ saying to her, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Weep not, </span> forbade not the natural expression of her passion, but signified a sudden and not expected resurrection, so as she should not weep without hope. This said, he cometh and toucheth the bier, or the coffin, and saith not, Young man, in the name of God, I say unto thee, Arise; but, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Young man, I say unto thee, Arise; </span> thereby declaring to them (would they have understood it) that he was the Son of God, and while he was on earth had a power in and from himself by the word of his mouth to command the dead to arise. His word was effective, and to evidence it, it is said, that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">he that was dead sat up, </span> so as all might take notice of the miracle, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and began to speak.

[The daughter of Jairus was first raised to life before the young man of Nain: and on that account the faith of Jairus is the more praiseworthy, because it had no precedent to look to of a dead man raised to life by Jesus. The Lord secretly raised the daughter of Jairus, and ordered that act of raising the dead to be even kept secret; but then next He raised up both the young man of Nain and Lazarus publicly.

For since the disciples went to the city of Nain in a body [whereas when sent forth they went “by two and two,” <a href="/mark/6-7.htm" title="And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;">Mark 6:7</a>], there is hardly reason to doubt that the raising up of the young man took place <span class="ital">before</span> the sending forth of the Twelve Apostles, who were confirmed in the faith by this very miracle.—Harm., p. 296.]—<span class="greekheb">Ναῒν</span>, <span class="ital">Nain</span>) The specification of the name of the town, as also the double multitude [the “much people” following the Lord, and also the “much people” following the funeral of the young man, <a href="/context/luke/7-11.htm" title="And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people....">Luke 7:11-12</a>] of spectators, confirms the certainty of the miracle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[70] Not <span class="ital">die sequenti</span>: the latter may be <span class="ital">a day following</span>: the former is necessarily <span class="ital">the following day</span>.—ED. and TRANSL.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[71] <span class="ital">ab</span> and the oldest MSS. of Vulg. have <span class="ital">deinceps. c</span> has <span class="ital">sequenti die</span>.—ED. and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-17.</span> <span class="accented">- The Master raises from the dead the only son of the widow of Nain.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">it came to pass the day after.</span> The Greek expression here, in the majority of the more ancient authorities, is vague as a note of time. The Revised Version renders it "soon afterwards." The incident that follows the raising from the dead of the widow's son is only mentioned by St. Luke. It is generally assumed that our Lord only raised three persons from the dead - this young man of Nain. the little daughter of Jairus the ruler, and Lazarus of Bethany. But such an assumption is purely arbitrary. We have before called attention to the vast number of miracles worked by Jesus during the two years and a half of the public ministry not reported by the evangelists at all, or only glanced at in passing. There were, most probably, among these unreported miracles several instances of men, women, and children raised from the dead. St. Augustine, in one of his sermons (98.), specially calls attention to this in his words, "of the numerous persons raised to life by Christ, three only are mentioned as specimens in the Gospels." Each evangelist specially chooses one of the various examples, no doubt known to him  - that peculiar instance or instances best suited to the especial teaching of his Gospel. St. John alone recounts the raising of Lazarus. St. Luke is the solitary reporter of the miracle performed on the dead son of the widow of Nain. We may reasonably infer, says Dean Plumptre, that this miracle, from its circumstances, had specially fixed itself in the memories of the "devout women" of <a href="/luke/8-1.htm">Luke 8:1</a>, and that it was from them that St. Luke obtained his accurate and detailed knowledge of this, as well as of many other of the incidents which he alone relates in his Gospel. <span class="cmt_word">He went into a</span> <span class="cmt_word">city called</span> Nain. From the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">naim fair</span>, probably so called from its striking situation on a steep hill. It is on the slope of Little Hermon, near Endor, some twenty or more miles from Capernaum. The name <span class="accented">Nein</span> is still given to a small poor village on the same site. It is approached by a narrow, steep ascent, and on either side of the road are sepulchral caves. It was in one of these  that the dead man was about to have been laid when the Master met the little mourning procession winding down the steep road as he and his crowd of followers were toiling up the ascent nearing the gate of the city. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The day after (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Others read &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, soon after. So Rev. Luke's usage favors the latter.<p>Nain<p>Mentioned nowhere else in the Bible. "On the northern slope of the rugged and barren ridge of Little Hermon, immediately west of Endor, which lies in a further recess of the same range, is the ruined village of Nain. No convent, no tradition marks the spot. But, under these circumstances, the name alone is sufficient to guarantee its authenticity. One entrance alone it could have had - that which opens on the rough hillside in its downward slope to the plain. It must have been in this steep descent, as, according to Eastern custom, they 'carried out the dead man,' that, 'nigh to the gate' of the village, the bier was stopped, and the long procession of mourners stayed, and ' the young man delivered back to his mother (Stanley, "Sinai and Palestine"). "It is in striking accord with the one biblical incident in the history of Nain that renders it dear to the Christian heart, that about the only remains of antiquity are tombs. These are cut in the rock, and are situated on the hillside to the east of the village" (Thomson, "Land and Book"). </body></html>
