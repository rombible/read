It clearly pointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their souls.

He would not suffer the multitudes who had heard the question of John to cherish one depreciatory thought of the Baptist; and yet he suffers the messengers to depart, lest, while hearing the grand eulogy of their Master, they should be pained by its concluding words. It is natural to suppose that the two disciples carried back to John some private message of peace and consolation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">A reed</span>] John was not like the reeds which they had seen waving in the wind on the banks of Jordan, but rather, as Lange says, ‘a cedar half uprooted by the storm.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John</span>. When the messengers of John were departed, the Lord, fearful lest the people who had been standing by and listening to the question which the Baptist had put, and his answer, should entertain any disparaging thought of a great and sorely tried saint of God, spoke the following noble testimony concerning that true, faithful witness. It has been termed the funeral oration of John; for not long after it had been spoken he was put to death by Herod Antipas. <span class="cmt_word">What</span> <span class="cmt_word">went ye out into the wilderness for to see</span> A <span class="cmt_word">reed shaken with the wind?</span> The imagery was taken from the scenery in the midst of which John the Baptist had principally exercised his ministry - the reedy banks of Jordan. It was surely to see an everyday sight - a weak vacillating man blown to and fro with every wind. John, though his faith failed him for a moment perhaps, was no wavering reed. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To see (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev. is correct but awkward, to behold.
