This they mention as an argument to induce him to have a regard to the centurion, though he was a Gentile; since he was a friend of the Jews, and well affected and disposed to them, which was very rare: it was not common for the Gentiles to love the Jews, any more than the Jews the Gentiles; there was an hatred, yea, an enmity between them; but this man, very likely, was a proselyte to their religion, as the following instance seems to show: <p>and he hath built us a synagogue; at his own private charge, and by the assistance of his soldiers under him, whom he might employ in this work: sometimes a single person built a synagogue at his own expense, and gave it to the citizens; of which the Jews say, (o). <p>"if a man builds an house, and afterwards devotes it to a synagogue, it is as a synagogue.'' <p>(o) Piske Harosh Megilia, c. 4. art. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/7-5.htm" title="For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.">Luke 7:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷ γὰρ</span>, etc., he loveth our race; a philo-Jewish Pagan, whose affection for the people among whom he lived took the form of building a synagogue. Quite a credible fact, which could easily be ascertained.

It is not impossible that he may have been a Roman, though there is no <span class="ital">direct</span> proof that Romans ever held such offices under Herod Antipas.

If Capernaum be Tel Hum (as I became convinced on the spot itself), then the ruins of it shew that it probably possessed two synagogues; and this we should have conjectured beforehand, seeing that Jerusalem is said to have had 400. The walls of one of these, built of white marble, are of the age of the Herods, and stand just above the lake. It may be the very building here referred to. This liberality on the part of the Gentiles was by no means unfrequent. Wealthy Gentile proselytes not seldom sent splendid gifts to the Temple itself.
