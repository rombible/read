It clearly pointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their souls.

No; not Messiah, but his forerunner. Centuries ago the mission of this John was foretold, and exactly described by one of the well-known and honoured prophet line. They who were listening, many of them, knew the words well, as the Teacher quoted from the great Malachi. The old ring of the famous prediction was unchanged; perhaps few of the by-standers noticed the slight alteration which was made by Jesus as he quoted. But in after-days the deep significance of the seemingly trifling change, we may well imagine, was the subject of many a deep solemn hour of meditation among the twelve and the early leaders of the faith. The words in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3</a>.1 stand thus: "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me." Our Lord so changes the text that, instead of "before me," it reads with this slight difference, "Behold, I send <span class="accented">my</span> messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee." The <span class="accented">Lord</span> who speaks by the prophets in Malachi announces <span class="accented">himself</span> as the coming angel of the covenant: "my messenger shall prepare the way before <span class="accented">me</span>;" but <span class="accented">this</span>, the Lord who is come as the Son of man, may not as yet openly declare; it is enough that by the thrice-repeated <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> ("<span class="accented">thy</span> face," "thy way," "before thee"), he signifies that he is marked out and referred to by the Father. See how, without directly uttering it, he nevertheless announces his <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> ("I am he") in his sublime humility (so Stier, 'Words of the Lord Jesus'). Godet presents the same thought from another point of view: "In the prophet's eyes he who was sending, and he before whom the way was to be prepared, were one and the same Person, Jehovah. Hence the ' before me' of Malachi. But for Jesus, who is speaking of himself, and never confounds himself with the Father, a distinction became necessary. It is not Jehovah speaking of himself but Jehovah speaking to Jesus; hence the form 'before thee.'" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Prepare (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>.<p>Least (&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., less.
