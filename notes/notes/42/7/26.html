It clearly pointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their souls.

From the scene and the surroundings - the reeds of the banks of Jordan - he went on to speak of the great Jordan preacher, so unlike, in spite of this one weak wavering hour, the reeds in the midst of which he preached. Jesus thus painted the grave, austere man, first in his stern enmity to the seductive magnificence of a court-life, then in his severe austerity as regards himself. Who, then, was he - this preacher to whom the people had resorted in such crowds to see and hear? Was he a prophet? was he one more of those men who in past ages had been the salt which preserved Israel from decay? Yes; that is what he was, that true great one - a prophet in the  deepest, truest sense of the word. Ah! higher still, went on the Teacher, John was much more than a prophet. What then? and the by-standers marvelled; what <span class="accented">more</span> could he be? Was he, peradventure, the Messiah? <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A prophet (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>The popular conception of a prophet is limited to his foretelling future events. This is indeed included in the term, but does not cover its meaning entirely. The word is from &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;, to speak, and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;, before, in front of. This meaning of the preposition may have reference to time, viz., before, beforehand; or to place, viz., in front of, and so, publicly; and this latter meaning, in turn, easily runs into that of in behalf of; for. The prophet is, therefore, primarily, one who speaks standing before another, and thus forming a medium between him and the hearer. This sense runs naturally into that of instead of. Hence it is the technical term for the interpreter of a divine message. So Plato: "For this reason it is customary to appoint diviners or interpreters to be judges of the true inspiration. Some persons call them diviners, seers (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;); they do not know that they are only repeaters of dark sayings and visions, and are not to be called diviners at all, but interpreters (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) of things divine" ("Timaeus," 72). Similarly of an advocate to speak for, or instead of one. The central idea of the word is, one to whom God reveals himself and through whom he speaks. The revelation may or may not relate to the future. The prophet is a forth-teller, not necessarily a foreteller. The essence of the prophetic character is immediate intercourse with God. One of the Hebrew names for "prophet," and, as some maintain, the earlier name, signified a shewer or seer. See <a href="/1_samuel/9-10.htm">1 Samuel 9:10</a>; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26-30</a>, Paul shows that revelation stands in necessary connection with prophesying. </body></html>
