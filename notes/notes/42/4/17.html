The other books, in like manner—singly or combined, according to their length—were written on rolls of parchment, and were unrolled from the cylinder to which they were fastened. Here, it is clear, Isaiah formed a roll by itself. It is a natural inference from the fact that it was given to Him, that it contained the prophetic lesson for the day. In the calendar of modern Jews, the lessons from Isaiah run parallel with those from Deuteronomy. The chapter which He read stands as the second lesson for the day of Atonement. We cannot prove that the existing order obtained in the time of our Lord’s ministry, but everything in Judaism rests mainly on old traditions; and there is therefore nothing extravagant in the belief that it was on the day of Atonement that the great Atoner thus struck what was the key-note of His whole work.<p><span class= "bld">When he had opened the book.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">when He had unrolled.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/4-17.htm" title="And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,...">Luke 4:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">There was delivered to him the book of Esaias </span>— A paragraph of the law having, according to custom, been read before. See on <a href="/acts/13-15.htm" title="And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.">Acts 13:15</a>. <span class="ital">When he had opened the book </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αναπτυξας</span>, <span class="ital">having unrolled </span>the volume of <span class="ital">the book. </span>The books of the ancients, as is well known, consisted of one long sheet of paper or parchment, which they rolled up neatly on a round piece of wood. When a book of this kind was to be read, they unrolled it gradually as they read it, and put what was read round another piece of wood of the same sort with the former. <span class="ital">He found the place </span>— The expression, <span class="greekheb">ευρε τον τοπον</span>, seems to imply, that upon unrolling the book, the passage here mentioned immediately met his eye, by the particular providence of God. Many commentators, however, think, that as the Scriptures were read in order, the passage mentioned was that which fell of course to be read in the synagogue that day. And according to the custom of all the synagogues, this passage was to be read with the fiftieth section of the law, appointed for the last sabbath of the sixth, or the first of the seventh month, answering to our August and September. So that if our Lord read this passage as the ordinary lesson for the day, the chronology of this part of the history is thereby determined. <span class="ital">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me </span>— This was said of the prophets, when they were under an immediate afflatus of the Holy Spirit; but it was here, doubtless, primarily meant of the Messiah: <span class="ital">because he hath anointed me — </span>That is, hath commissioned me with authority, qualified me with gifts, and set me apart for the important offices here mentioned. The expression is used in allusion to the Jewish prophets, priests, and kings, who were consecrated to their offices by anointing them with oil. The unction of the Messiah was the Holy Spirit, which he had without measure. <span class="ital">To preach the gospel to the poor </span>— The reason why I, the Messiah, enjoy so great a degree of inspiration, and am endowed with the power of working such astonishing miracles is, because God hath commissioned me to preach the glad tidings of salvation to the poor, and by so doing, <span class="ital">to heal the broken-hearted </span>— That is, to relieve and comfort all those, without distinction, whose hearts are broken by sharp convictions of sin, and fears of future punishment. The passage of Isaiah here quoted, in our translation stands thus: <span class="ital">To preach good tidings to the meek </span>— But the word <span class="greekheb">ענוים</span>, signifies more properly persons in a <span class="ital">low </span>and <span class="ital">afflicted </span>condition. It is certainly an unspeakable recommendation of the gospel dispensation, that it offers the pardon of sin, and salvation, to all on the same terms. The rich, here, have no pre- eminence over the poor; as they seem to have had under the law, which prescribed such costly sacrifices for the atonement of sin as were very burdensome to the poor. The Prophet Isaiah, therefore, in describing the happiness of gospel times, very fitly introduces the Messiah mentioning this as one of the many blessings which would accrue to the world from his coming, that the glad tidings of salvation were to be preached by him and his ministers to the poor, and consequently were to be offered to them <span class="ital">without money and without price. To preach deliverance to the captives — </span>To proclaim to the captives of sin and Satan liberty from the power of their tyrannical masters, on the terms of repentance toward God, and faith in the Messiah, now manifested: and to confer that liberty on such as complied with these terms. <span class="ital">And recovering of sight to the blind </span>— Not merely to confer bodily sight on a few blind individuals, but to open the eyes of the understanding of millions, and cure their spiritual blindness, by imparting to them <span class="ital">the spirit of wisdom and revelation. </span>Thus, <a href="/context/isaiah/42-6.htm" title="I the LORD have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;...">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>, the Messiah is said to be given <span class="ital">for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes. </span>And the commission given to Paul, as recorded, <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>, was, <span class="ital">I send thee to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light: </span>in both which passages spiritual illumination is undoubtedly solely intended. <span class="ital">To set at liberty them that are bruised </span>— With the heavy load of their fetters and chains; with the guilt and power of their iniquities, and the condemnation and wrath due to them on that account. Here is a beautiful gradation, in comparing the spiritual state of man to the miserable state of those captives who were not only cast into prison, but, like Zedekiah, had their eyes put out, and were laden and bruised with chains of iron. <span class="ital">To preach the acceptable year of the Lord </span>— To proclaim that happy period of the divine dispensations toward mankind, in which a full and free remission of all their offences was to be offered to them, and which might be fitly represented in prophecy by the Jewish jubilee, wherein debts were forgiven, slaves released, and inheritances restored to their original owners. For a further explanation of this passage, see the notes on <a href="/context/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;...">Isaiah 61:1-3</a>; and <a href="/context/isaiah/42-6.htm" title="I the LORD have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;...">Isaiah 42:6-7</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:14-30 Christ taught in their synagogues, their places of public worship, where they met to read, expound, and apply the word, to pray and praise. All the gifts and graces of the Spirit were upon him and on him, without measure. By Christ, sinners may be loosed from the bonds of guilt, and by his Spirit and grace from the bondage of corruption. He came by the word of his gospel, to bring light to those that sat in the dark, and by the power of his grace, to give sight to those that were blind. And he preached the acceptable year of the Lord. Let sinners attend to the Saviour's invitation when liberty is thus proclaimed. Christ's name was Wonderful; in nothing was he more so than in the word of his grace, and the power that went along with it. We may well wonder that he should speak such words of grace to such graceless wretches as mankind. Some prejudice often furnishes an objection against the humbling doctrine of the cross; and while it is the word of God that stirs up men's enmity, they will blame the conduct or manner of the speaker. The doctrine of God's sovereignty, his right to do his will, provokes proud men. They will not seek his favour in his own way; and are angry when others have the favours they neglect. Still is Jesus rejected by multitudes who hear the same message from his words. While they crucify him afresh by their sins, may we honour him as the Son of God, the Saviour of men, and seek to show we do so by our obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There was delivered unto him - By the minister of the synagogue, or the keeper of the sacred books.

Secondly, it may learn us not to be too curious as to minute things in Scripture, for had it been a thing of moment, the Holy Spirit of God had certainly never suffered Luke to write after their copy, either there or here. God never had a church in any place, but he soon stirred up some to make an interpretation of the Scriptures for their use, and so far assisted them, that though they might differ from the Hebrew text, or the Greek, in some minute things, yet they differed not in any thing of moment necessary for us to know and believe in order to salvation. And the frequent quotations we have in the New Testament out of the Septuagint, incline us to think that it is the will of God, that particular persons in churches should make use of such versions, and take them for the Holy Scriptures, not lightly and ordinarily varying from them; the translating of Scriptures, being not an ordinary ministerial gift, but the work of some stirred up by God unto it, and whom he more than ordinarily so assists, as that they have not erred in any momentous thing. If this may be admitted, we need not lay the fault upon those who transcribed Luke’s copy. But let us come to the text itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me.</span> Anointing may signify two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The endowment of the person with gifts and abilities fit for his work. Thus, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1Jo 2:27</a></span>, <span class="ital">the anointing</span> is said to <span class="ital">teach us all things</span>; and Christ is said, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a> <a href="/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a></span>, to be <span class="ital">anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows</span>, which the Baptist seemeth to interpret, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a></span>, <span class="ital">God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Anointing also was a symbol of God’s calling out and sending a person to the execution of an office, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm" title="And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.">2 Kings 9:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. I find also anointing used as a symbol of God’s purpose and designation of a person to an employment, to the performance of which he did not presently call him; thus David was anointed, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1 Samuel 16:13</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, </span> I conceive is meant, exciting and quickening Christ to the present execution of that office to which God had anointed him; that is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of old designed him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Fitted him, giving him the Spirit not by measure; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Now called him to the exercise of it: and because the Lord had so designed him, so prepared, and now so called him, the Spirit now excited and quickened him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God stirreth up none to take upon them the office of the ministry, whom he hath not fitted with gifts for the discharge of it. But what was this employment to which Christ was anointed? euaggelizesyai, <span class="ital">to preach the gospel to the poor</span>. This was the great work of our Lord and Saviour, to preach. And what? The gospel, the glad tidings of salvation. To whom? htwcoiv: it is used to signify those that are mean in the world, and, by a figure, those that are miserable and afflicted; and this I should take to be the sense here, in conformity to that other phrase which our Saviour useth to John’s disciples, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

Zadok, so the writers of books in Jerusalem made their books: the Rabbins teach, that they do not make the book of the law its length, more than its circumference, nor its circumference more than its length.'' <p>Such a roll, or volume, of the prophet Isaiah, Christ unrolled, till he came to the place he intended to read: it is a rule with the Jews (z) that <p>"they do not unroll the book of the law in the congregation, because of the glory of the congregation.'' <p>It may therefore be asked, whether Christ did not break this rule, since he unrolled the book that was given him, publicly in the synagogue? To which it may be replied, that it was lawful to unroll the book of the prophets, which was what Christ did, but not the law; for so runs another of their rules, (a). <p>"they skip in the prophets, but not in the law, because,  , "that they unroll a prophet publicly", but they do not unroll the law publicly.'' <p>Christ having thus unrolled the volume of the prophet Isaiah, which was put into his hands by the "Chazan", or minister, <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.

In the sabbath service there were two lessons read. The first was always taken from the Pentateuch (the Law). The five books of Moses were written on parchment, (usually) between two rollers, and the day's lesson was left unrolled for the reader's convenience. The Prophets were on single rollers, no special portion being left open. It has been suggested that the great and famous Messianic passage read by our Lord was the lesson for the day. This is quite uncertain; indeed, it is more probable that Jesus, when the roll of Isaiah was handed to him by the ruler of the synagogue, specially selected the section containing this passage. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The book (&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>A diminutive of &#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the inner bark of the papyrus, used for writing.
