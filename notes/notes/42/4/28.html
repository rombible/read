All the gifts and graces of the Spirit were upon him and on him, without measure. By Christ, sinners may be loosed from the bonds of guilt, and by his Spirit and grace from the bondage of corruption. He came by the word of his gospel, to bring light to those that sat in the dark, and by the power of his grace, to give sight to those that were blind. And he preached the acceptable year of the Lord. Let sinners attend to the Saviour's invitation when liberty is thus proclaimed. Christ's name was Wonderful; in nothing was he more so than in the word of his grace, and the power that went along with it. We may well wonder that he should speak such words of grace to such graceless wretches as mankind. Some prejudice often furnishes an objection against the humbling doctrine of the cross; and while it is the word of God that stirs up men's enmity, they will blame the conduct or manner of the speaker. The doctrine of God's sovereignty, his right to do his will, provokes proud men. They will not seek his favour in his own way; and are angry when others have the favours they neglect. Still is Jesus rejected by multitudes who hear the same message from his words. While they crucify him afresh by their sins, may we honour him as the Son of God, the Saviour of men, and seek to show we do so by our obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Filled with wrath - They were enraged, probably, for the following reasons:<p>1.

That the "Gentiles" were objects of compassion with God, and that God often showed more favor to a "single" Gentile than to multitudes of Jews in the same circumstances.<p>4.

That it was a part of his design to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, and not confine his labors to them only.<p>On these accounts their favor was soon turned to wrath, and the whole transaction shows us:<p>1.

Thus, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a></span>, the Jews heard Paul patiently, till he repeated God’s commission to him to go <span class="ital">unto the Gentiles</span>; then they cried, <span class="ital">Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit he should live</span>.

Those of Nazareth which were in the synagogue hearing these things, are filled with wrath, <span class="ital">thrust</span> Christ <span class="ital">out of the city</span>, as not fit to live among them, and go about to kill him, by throwing him down headlong from the brow of the hill upon which their city was built. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But he passing through the midst of them went his way.</span> How he got out of their hands, when they had laid hold of him, the Scripture doth not tell us, nor is it our concern to be curious to inquire.

We know it was an easy thing for him, who was God as well as man, to quit himself of any mortal enemies; but how he did it, whether by blinding their eyes, or altering the nature of his body, and making it imperceptible by them, or by a greater strength than they, (which the Divine nature could easily supply his human nature with), who is able to determine? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all they in the synagogue,....

Perhaps they were already offended by knowing that Jesus had spent two days at Sychar among the hated Samaritans; and now He whom they wished to treat as “the carpenter” and their equal, was as it were asserting the superior claims of Gentiles and lepers. “Truth embitters those whom it does not enlighten.” “The word of God,” said Luther, “is a sword, is a war, is a poison, is a scandal, is a stumbling-block, is a ruin”—viz. to those who resist it (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm" title="Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.">Matthew 10:34</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1 Peter 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/4-28.htm" title="And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,">Luke 4:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Θυμοῦ</span>, with <span class="ital">wrath</span>) They had thought that the giving of a very different character to themselves, and a different return, namely thanks, were due to them for their applause.

The Jews in the synagogue quickly caught the Master's meaning. Thoughts such as "Thou our Messiah, who talkest of Gentile, Syrian, and Zidonian in the same breath with us the chosen and elect of God, who hintest at the possibility of the accursed Gentile sharing in our promised blessings!" flashed through their minds, and as one man the congregation rose, and, seizing the Preacher, dragged him out of the synagogue, and hurried him through the little town to one of the rocky precipices close by. </body></html>
