He shall be called Johanan, or Gracious, because he shall bring in the gospel of Christ, wherein God's grace shines most bright. Zacharias recovered his speech. Unbelief closed his mouth, and believing opened it again: he believers, therefore he speaks. When God opens our lips, our mouths must show forth his praise; and better be without speech, than not use it in praising God. It is said, The hand of the Lord was working with John.

Who was deaf, as well as dumb; otherwise there would have been no occasion to have signs made to him: and so the word used, in <a href="/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a> signifies both deaf and dumb. These signs were made by hands or head; for such used to be made to a dumb man. According to the canon (q), a dumb man nods, and "and is nodded", or "beckoned to": and which beckoning one of the commentators (r) says, is a sign which is expressed either by the hands or head.
