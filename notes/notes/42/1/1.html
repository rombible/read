It is true, the word <span class="greekheb">επεχειρησαν</span>, <span class="ital">have undertaken, </span>used here by Luke, does not necessarily imply any censure on the writers of such accounts, but the scope of the place seems to imply it, if not on all, at least on some of them: for if all, or even most of them, had furnished true narratives, the number was an argument rather against a new attempt than for it. Grotius justly observes, that the spurious gospels, mentioned by ancient writers, are forgeries manifestly of a later date than the time of Luke. That there were, however, some such performances at the time when Luke began to write, the words of this evangelist are a sufficient evidence: for, to consider this book merely on the footing of a human composition, what writer of common sense would introduce himself to the public by observing the numerous attempts that had been made by former writers, some of whom at least had not been at due pains to be properly informed, if he himself were actually the first, or even the second, or the third, who had written on the subject; and if one of the two who preceded him had better opportunities of knowing than he, and the other fully as good? But the total disappearance of those spurious writings, probably no better than hasty collections of flying rumours, containing a mixture of truth and falsehood, may, after the genuine gospels were generally known and read, be easily accounted for. At midnight, the glimmering of the taper is not without its use, but it can make no conceivable addition to the light of the meridian sun. It deserves, however, to be remarked by the way, that whatever may be thought to be insinuated here by the evangelist, concerning the imperfect information of former historians, there is no hint given of their bad designs. It is justly observed here by Dr. Campbell, that the very circumstance of the number of such narratives, at so early a period, is itself an evidence that there was something in the first publication of the Christian doctrine, which, notwithstanding the many unfavourable circumstances wherewith it was attended, excited the curiosity and awakened the attention of persons of all ranks and denominations; insomuch that every narrative, which pretended to furnish men with any additional information concerning so extraordinary a personage as Jesus, seems to have been read with avidity. <span class="ital">To set forth in order a declaration </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">αναταξασθαι διηγησιν</span>, to compose a narrative; <span class="ital">of those things which are most surely believed among us </span>— As the great foundation of our common faith. The expression, <span class="greekheb">πραγματων</span>, refers not only to the things believed, but also to the things performed by Christ and his apostles; this first history of Luke being designed to record what Jesus himself said or did, <a href="/acts/1-1.htm" title="The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,">Acts 1:1</a>; and his second, to relate the acts of the apostles: and the participle, <span class="greekheb">πεπληροφορημενων</span>, translated, <span class="ital">most surely believed, </span>is rather to be understood as referring to the fulness of that evidence with which the things were attended, than to the confidence with which they were credited. It not only signifies that the doctrines were taught and the things done, but that they were taught and done with such circumstances, as laid a foundation for <span class="greekheb">πληροφορια της πιστεως</span>, <span class="ital">a full assurance of faith, </span>as to the truth of the doctrines, and the reality of the facts. <span class="ital">Even as they delivered them, which from the beginning</span> — Of Christ’s ministry; <span class="ital">were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word </span>— Because the persons, according to whose information the writers referred to by Luke composed their histories, are said to have been <span class="ital">eye-witnesses </span>as well as <span class="ital">ministers of the word, </span>(<span class="greekheb">του λογου</span>,) several writers have supposed that, by <span class="ital">the word, </span>Luke meant Christ himself, one of whose titles is, <span class="ital">the Word, </span><a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, and, <span class="ital">the Word of God, </span><a href="/revelation/19-13.htm" title="And he was clothed with a clothing dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.">Revelation 19:13</a>.

And to Christians these were matters of such moment, that the knowledge, consideration, and remembrance of them, were the great business and comfort of their lives. It is no wonder, therefore, that those who were able should set down in writing such particulars of them as they had learned, whether from the conversations or sermons of the apostles and eye-witnesses. But histories thus drawn up, though they might contain many things highly worthy of the notice of Christians, must needs have been defective both in their matter and manner. Wherefore, Luke, having attained a thorough knowledge of our Lord’s history from the very beginning, thought fit to give a more full, regular, and connected account of it than had hitherto appeared, as he signifies in the next verse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-4. Luke will not write of things about which Christians may safely differ from one another, and hesitate within themselves; but the things which are, and ought to be surely believed. The doctrine of Christ is what the wisest and best of men have ventured their souls upon with confidence and satisfaction. And the great events whereon our hopes depend, have been recorded by those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses and ministers of the word, and who were perfected in their understanding of them through Divine inspiration.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forasmuch as many - It has been doubted who are referred to here by the word "many." It seems clear that it could not be the other evangelists, for the gospel by "John" was not yet written, and the word "many" denotes clearly more than "two." Besides, it is said that they undertook to record what the "eye-witnesses" had delivered to them, so that the writers did not pretend to be eye-witnesses themselves. It is clear, therefore, that other writings are meant than the gospels which we now have, but what they were is a matter of conjecture. What are now known as spurious gospels were written long after Luke wrote his. It is probable that Luke refers to "fragments" of history, or to narratives of "detached" sayings, acts, or parables of our Lord, which had been made and circulated among the disciples and others. His doctrines were original, bold, pure, and authoritative. His miracles had been extraordinary, clear, and awful. His life and death had been peculiar; and it is not improbable - indeed it is highly probable that such broken accounts and narratives of detached facts would be preserved. That this is what Luke means appears farther from <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>, where "he" professes to give a regular, full, and systematic account from the very beginning - "having had perfect understanding of "all things from the very first." The records of the others - the "many" - were broken and incomplete. His were to be regular and full.<p>Taken in hand - Undertaken, attempted.<p>To set forth in order - To compose a narrative. It does not refer to the "order" or "arrangement," but means simply to give a narrative. The word rendered here "in order" is different from that in the third verse, which "has" reference "to order," or to a full and fair "arrangement" of the principal facts, etc., in the history of our Lord.<p>A declaration - A narrative - an account of.<p>Which are most surely believed among us - Among Christians - among all the Christians then living. Here we may remark:<p>1. That Christians of that day had the best of all opportunities for knowing whether those things were true. Many had seen them, and all others had had the account from those who had witnessed them.<p>2. That infidels now cannot "possibly" be as good judges in the matter as those who lived at the time, and who were thus competent to determine whether these things were true or false.<p>3. That all Christians do "most surely believe" the truth of the gospel. It is their life, their hope, their all. Nor can they doubt that their Saviour lived, bled, died, rose, and still lives; that he was their atoning sacrifice, and that he is God over all, blessed forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE Commentary by David Brown   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>The writer of this Gospel is universally allowed to have been Lucas (an abbreviated form of Lucanus, as Silas of Silvanus), though he is not expressly named either in the Gospel or in the Acts. From Col 4:14 we learn that he was a "physician"; and by comparing that verse with Col 4:10, 11&#8212;in which the apostle enumerates all those of the circumcision who were then with him, but does not mention Luke, though he immediately afterwards sends a salutation from him&#8212;we gather that Luke was not a born Jew. Some have thought he was a freed-man (libertinus), as the Romans devolved the healing art on persons of this class and on their slaves, as an occupation beneath themselves. His intimate acquaintance with Jewish customs, and his facility in Hebraic Greek, seem to show that he was an early convert to the Jewish faith; and this is curiously confirmed by Ac 21:27-29, where we find the Jews enraged at Paul's supposed introduction of Greeks into the temple, because they had seen "Trophimus the Ephesian" with him; and as we know that Luke was with Paul on that occasion, it would seem that they had taken him for a Jew, as they made no mention of him. On the other hand, his fluency in classical Greek confirms his Gentile origin. The time when he joined Paul's company is clearly indicated in the Acts by his changing (at Ac 16:10) from the third person singular ("he") to the first person plural ("we"). From that time he hardly ever left the apostle till near the period of his martyrdom (2Ti 4:11). Eusebius makes him a native of Antioch. If so, he would have every advantage for cultivating the literature of Greece and such medical knowledge as was then possessed. That he died a natural death is generally agreed among the ancients; Gregory Nazianzen alone affirming that he died a martyr.<p>The time and place of the publication of his Gospel are alike uncertain. But we can approximate to it. It must at any rate have been issued before the Acts, for there the 'Gospel' is expressly referred to as the same author's "former treatise" (Ac 1:1). Now the Book of the Acts was not published for two whole years after Paul's arrival as a prisoner at Rome, for it concludes with a reference to this period; but probably it was published soon after that, which would appear to have been early in the year 63. Before that time, then, we have reason to believe that the Gospel of Luke was in circulation, though the majority of critics make it later. If we date it somewhere between A.D. 50 and 60, we shall probably be near the truth; but nearer it we cannot with any certainty come. Conjectures as to the place of publication are too uncertain to be mentioned here.<p>That it was addressed, in the first instance, to Gentile readers, is beyond doubt. This is no more, as Davidson remarks [Introduction to the New Testament, p. 186], than was to have been expected from the companion of an "apostle of the Gentiles," who had witnessed marvellous changes in the condition of many heathens by the reception of the Gospel. But the explanations in his Gospel of things known to every Jew, and which could only be intended for Gentile readers, make this quite plain&#8212;see Lu 1:26; 4:31; 8:26; 21:37; 22:1; 24:13. A number of other minute particulars, both of things inserted and of things omitted, confirm the conclusion that it was Gentiles whom this Evangelist had in the first instance in view.<p>We have already adverted to the classical style of Greek which this Evangelist writes&#8212;just what might have been expected from an educated Greek and travelled physician. But we have also observed that along with this he shows a wonderful flexibility of style, so much so, that when he comes to relate transactions wholly Jewish, where the speakers and actors and incidents are all Jewish, he writes in such Jewish Greek as one would do who had never been out of Palestine or mixed with any but Jews. In Da Costa's'S Four Witnesses will be found some traces of "the beloved physician" in this Gospel. But far more striking and important are the traces in it of his intimate connection with the apostle of the Gentiles. That one who was so long and so constantly in the society of that master mind has in such a work as this shown no traces of that connection, no stamp of that mind, is hardly to be believed. Writers of Introductions seem not to see it, and take no notice of it. But those who look into the interior of it will soon discover evidences enough in it of a Pauline cast of mind. Referring for a number of details to Da Costa, we notice here only two examples: In 1Co 11:23, Paul ascribes to an express revelation from Christ Himself the account of the Institution of the Lord's Supper which he there gives. Now, if we find this account differing in small yet striking particulars from the accounts given by Matthew and Mark, but agreeing to the letter with Luke's account, it can hardly admit of a doubt that the one had it from the other; and in that case, of course, it was Luke that had it from Paul. Now Matthew and Mark both say of the Cup, "This is my blood of the New Testament"; while Paul and Luke say, in identical terms, "This cup is the New Testament in My blood" (1Co 11:25; Lu 22:20). Further, Luke says, "Likewise also the cup after supper, saying," &c.; while Paul says, "After the same manner He took the cup when He had supped, saying," &c.; whereas neither Matthew nor Mark mention that this was after supper. But still more striking is another point of coincidence in this case. Matthew and Mark both say of the Bread merely this: "Take, eat; this is My body" (Mt 26:26; Mr 14:22); whereas Paul says, "Take, eat, this is My body, which is broken for you" (1Co 11:24), and Luke, "This is My body, which is given for you" (Lu 22:19). And while Paul adds the precious clause, "This do in remembrance of Me," Luke does the same, in identical terms. How can one who reflects on this resist the conviction of a Pauline stamp in this Gospel? The other proof of this to which we ask the reader's attention is in the fact that Paul, in enumerating the parties by whom Christ was seen after His resurrection, begins, singularly enough, with Peter&#8212;"And that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the Twelve" (1Co 15:4, 5)&#8212;coupled with the remarkable fact, that Luke is the only one of the Evangelists who mentions that Christ appeared to Peter at all. When the disciples had returned from Emmaus to tell their brethren how the Lord had appeared to them in the way, and how He had made Himself known to them in the breaking of bread, they were met, as Luke relates, ere they had time to utter a word, with this wonderful piece of news, "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon" (Lu 24:34).<p>Other points connected with this Gospel will be adverted to in the Commentary.   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Lu 1:1-4.<p>It appears from the Acts of the Apostles, and the Apostolic Epistles, that the earliest preaching of the Gospel consisted of a brief summary of the facts of our Lord's earthly history, with a few words of pointed application to the parties addressed. Of these astonishing facts, notes would naturally be taken and digests put into circulation. It is to such that Luke here refers; and in terms of studied respect, as narratives of what was "believed surely," or "on sure grounds" among Christians, and drawn up from the testimony of "eye-witnesses and ministering servants of the word." But when he adds that "it seemed good to him also to write in order, having traced down all things with exactness from their first rise," it is a virtual claim for his own Gospel to supersede these "many" narratives. Accordingly, while not one of them has survived the wreck of time, this and the other canonical Gospels live, and shall live, the only fitting vehicles of those life-bringing facts which have made all things new. Apocryphal or spurious gospels, upheld by parties unfriendly to the truths exhibited in the canonical Gospels, have not perished; but those well-meant and substantially correct narratives here referred to, used only while better were not to be had, were by tacit consent allowed to merge in the four peerless documents which from age to age, and with astonishing unanimity, have been accepted as the written charter of all Christianity.<p>1. set forth in order&#8212;more simply, to draw up a narrative.<span class="bld">Luk 1:1-4</span> Luke's preface.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:5-17</span> An angel appeareth to Zacharias, and promises him a<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>son in his old age.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:18-23</span> Zacharias doubting is struck dumb for a sign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:24-25</span> His wife Elisabeth conceives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:26-38</span> The angel's visit to Mary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:39-45</span> Elisabeth, saluted by Mary, prophesieth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:46-56</span> Mary's song of thanksgiving.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:57-63</span> The birth and circumcision of John the Baptist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:64-66</span> Zacharias's mouth is opened.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Luk 1:67-80</span> His prophecy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ver. 1-4. Luke's evangelical history hath this peculiar to itself, that whereas the histories of the other evangelists are written to the whole world, having no particular inscription, or dedication, Luke dedicates his to a particular person, named Theophilus; for though that name signifieth <span class="ital">one that loveth God, </span> yet I cannot think it is to be taken here appellatively, it being commonly used as a proper name; parents in former ages giving children names generally either expressive of their children's duty to God, (that by their names they might be put in mind of it), or expressive of God's mercy to themselves in giving them such children. The evangelist here suggests, that many had taken in hand orderly to write an account of the things which were certainly believed amongst the Jews. Some think that Luke here reflects upon some that, even so early, had given false accounts of our Saviour's history; for there were several pretended Gospels wrote, called, The Gospel of the Nazarenes, of Thomas, Matthias, Nicodemus, and many others, which the church soon saw cause to reject. But others think that Luke doth not at all reflect, and possibly those figments were not so early; but Luke, observing that many did write this famous history, and some, possibly, for want of due information, not so exactly as they might, yet as they were delivered to them from such as <span class="ital">from the beginning were eye witnesses, and ministers of the word, </span> but possibly might not be able so exactly to inform them, or the writers not so able duly to digest them (for most think Matthew, Mark, and John wrote after); or possibly because, there being then no printing, but all in manuscripts, because he thought his friend Theophilus (to whom he knew such a history would be grateful) might not have come to the sight of those manuscripts, he undertakes (not without the direction of the Holy Spirit, as appeared afterward) to compile a history of these things, to which he was either encouraged by the example of others, or incited by the mistakes of those who had done it ill, having the advantage perfectly to understand all things from the first. Most think that this advantage arose not from his personal knowledge, but his converse with the apostles and other ministers of Christ; for he saith no more, <span class="bld">Luk 1:2</span>, than, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye witnesses, and ministers of the word; </span> by which it seemeth to be hinted to us, that he was no eyewitness, nor minister of the word. To understand by <span class="ital">the word</span> in that verse Christ (whom John indeed so calleth, <span class="bld">Joh 1:1</span>) seemeth to me too hard, considering <span class="ital">the word, </span> in the evangelists, doth ordinarily signify the gospel, and no where Christ but in <span class="bld">Joh 1:1,2</span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed; </span>hat is, by the relation of others. Before I pass this preface, I shall make some observations upon it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That even from the beginning there were some cheats, in reporting matters of fact concerning the church. Whether Luke intended to reflect on them, or not, if we may believe any thing of ecclesiastical history, there were some false Gospels; and before the time of the Gospel there were apocryphal writings relating to the history of the Old Testament. No writings but the Scriptures deserve our faith (otherwise than they agree with them) in things of which they give us an account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. In Luke's time the history of the Gospel was most surely believed, as being delivered from eyewitnesses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Men ought to have perfect understanding of matters of fact before they write them. Whoso writes a history upon uncertainty, imposes upon all future ages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. A knowledge of certainties is what all good men ought to aim at in writing and reading. It is a mean soul that can feed upon an uncertainty, and they are as mean that spend their time in catering such food for reasonable souls. Men's understandings are given them for nobler uses than to gain the notion of a falsehood, and they are low born souls that can spend their precious hours in such cookery let the sauce with which they serve it up be never so artificial. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand,.... From hence, to the end of <a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a> is a preface of the evangelist to his Gospel, setting forth the reasons of his writing it; and which he wrote and sent to the excellent Theophilus, for the further confirmation of him in the faith of Christ. It seems that many had took in hand, or attempteo set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us; that is, they undertook to write and publish a very particular and exact narrative of the birth, life, actions, doctrines, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ; things which Luke, and other Christians, had the fullest and strongest evidence, and were confidently assured of, and most firmly believed, even with a full assurance of faith. By these many, he cannot mean the authentic historians of evangelical facts, as Matthew and Mark; for they two cannot, with any propriety, be called many; and besides, it is not so very clear and certain a point, that they had, as yet, wrote their Gospels; nor would this evangelist suggest any deficiency, weakness, and inaccuracy in them, as he seems to do: nor does he intend such spurious writers as the authors of the Gospels according to the Nazarenes, Hebrews, and Egyptians; of Nicodemus, Thomas, Matthias, and of the twelve apostles; and still less, the Gospels of Cerinthus, Basilides, and other heretics; since these would not have passed without a censure from him, for the falsehood, fabulous, and trifling stuff in them, as well as for the wicked and heretical opinions propagated by them; and besides, these pieces were not extant when this Gospel was written: but he seems to design some honest and well meaning Christians, who undertook to write, and did write an account of the above things, which were firmly believed by all; and which they took from the apostles, and first ministers of the Gospel, from their sermons and discourses, and from conversation with them; and which they committed to writing, partly to help their own memories, and partly for the benefit of others; in which, no doubt, they acted an upright part, though attended with weakness: wherefore, the evangelist does not censure them as false, wicked, and heretical, nor approve of them as divine and perfect for though they honestly meant, and designed well, yet there might be many things collected by them, which were impertinent, and not proper to be transmitted to posterity; and what might be wrote with great inaccuracy and deficiency, and in a style the Holy Ghost thought improper things of this kind should be delivered in: and therefore the evangelist, moved and inspired by the Spirit of God, set about the following work, and under the same influence completed it. The phrase, , "to set forth in order a declaration", is as Dr. Lightfoot observes, out of the Talmud (h), agreeably to the Jewish way of speaking, <p>"R.

See, on the other hand, Hilgenfeld in his <span class="ital">Zeitschr.</span> 1864, p. 443 ff.

Introduction<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Forasmuch as</span>] This brief preface is in several respects most interesting and important.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>i. It is the only personal introduction to any historic book in the Bible except the Acts. It is specially valuable here as authenticating the first two chapters and shewing that Marcion’s excision of them was only due to his desire to suppress the true humanity of Christ, as his other mutilations of the Gospel—(which made it “like a garment eaten by moths,” Epiphan.)—were due to hostility to the Old Testament. See Mill’s <span class="ital">Mythical Interpretation</span>, p. 103.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>ii. The style in which it is written is purer and more polished than that of the rest of the Gospel, though it is “the most literary of the Gospels.” It was the custom of antiquity to give special elaboration to the opening clauses of a great work, as we see in the Histories of Thucydides, Livy, &c. In the rest of the Gospel the style of the Evangelist is often largely modified by the documents of which he made such diligent use.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>iii. It shews us in the simplest and most striking manner that the Divine Inspiration was in no way intended to supersede the exercise of human diligence and judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>iv. It proves how “<span class="ital">many</span>” early attempts to narrate the Life of Christ have perished. We may well suppose that they have only perished because the Four Evangelists were guided by “a grace of superintendency” to select and to record all that was most needful for us to know, and to preserve everything which was accurate and essential in the narratives (<span class="greekheb">διηγήσεις</span>) which had previously been published.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>v. It furnishes us on the very threshold with a key to the aims of the Evangelist in the more systematic and comprehensive history which he is now led to write. With a modesty, which is also evinced by his self-suppression in the Acts of the Apostles, he here lays claim to nothing beyond methodical order and diligent research.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>vi. We see at once from this preface the association of thought and expression between St Luke and his great Teacher. Several of the most marked words, ‘attempted,’ ‘most surely believed,’ ‘orally instructed,’ ‘certainty,’ are only found elsewhere in the letters and speeches of St Paul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/1-1.htm" title="For as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,">Luke 1:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπειδήπερ</span>, <span class="ital">Forasmuch as</span>) A brief dedication applying to both the works of Luke:[1] it may be also termed the Preface or Introduction, and from it there shine forth pre-eminently gravity, simplicity, and candour.—<span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ ἐπεχείρησαν</span> <span class="ital">many have taken in hand</span>) Luke does not hereby denote Matthew and John, who had been among the very <span class="ital">eye-witnesses</span> of the facts and ministers of the word; not to say that Luke both wrote before John, and does not seem to have seen the Gospel of Matthew. There remains the one evangelist Mark alone; but Luke speaks of many, and employs the word <span class="greekheb">ἐπεχείρησαν</span>, <span class="ital">have taken in hand</span>, in a middle sense [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> neither expressing disparagement nor praise]; and consonant with this is the particle <span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span>, <span class="ital">even as</span>, which implies a consonance with the relation [report] of the eye-witnesses and ministers either sought after or attained by the writers alluded to: also the expression <span class="greekheb">κἀμοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">to me also</span>, agrees with the same view; for by it Luke does not so much oppose himself to those many writers, but rather adds himself to their number, as one of the same class, in such a manner, however, as that he may contribute somewhat even still to the <span class="greekheb">ἀσφάλεια</span> and firm assurance of Theophilus. He therefore intimates, if only he has had reference [not merely to others, but] also to Mark [<span class="ital">which indeed, if you compare together the forms of expression and the order of narratives in each, is not very unlikely</span>.—Harm., p. 36], that several particulars, not mentioned in Mark, are read to his hand for recording; but that the other writers, as, for instance, he who wrote <span class="ital">the Gospel according to the Egyptians</span>, are less calculated to serve towards producing <span class="greekheb">ἀσφάλεια</span> and firm assurance.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνατάξασθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to set forth in order</span>) in writing or instructive [catechetico, referring to <span class="greekheb">κατηχήθης</span>, <a href="/luke/1-4.htm" title="That you might know the certainty of those things, wherein you have been instructed.">Luke 1:4</a>] words.

Such vigour characterized <span class="greekheb">τὰ πράγματα</span>, the Christian <span class="ital">facts</span>, which Luke describes in both his works, whilst they were occurring [were being accomplished]: and these alone had this characteristic; for which reason this periphrasis whereby he designates the same facts is quite sufficient. It was in the sight of the world that the Gospel facts occurred: <a href="/acts/26-26.htm" title="For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.">Acts 26:26</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">among us</span>) in the Church, but especially among the teachers, and these veterans.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] The names <span class="ital">Lucius</span> and <span class="ital">Lucas</span> are the same; except that the former, being a diminutive of the latter, has somewhat of a more familiar sound. Mention is made as early as in <a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a> of a <span class="ital">Lucius of Cyrene</span> among the prophets and teachers of the Church, which at that time flourished at Antioch; and therefore it must have been but a short time after the death which befel Herod (ch. <a href="/luke/12-23.htm" title="The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.">Luke 12:23</a>), A. Dion. Era, 44. It is owing to this, I am inclined to think, that Eusebius and others have considered <span class="ital">Antioch</span> as the native place of Luke. Furthermore, Paul makes mention of a certain <span class="ital">Lucius</span> among his ‘kinsmen,’ <a href="/romans/16-21.htm" title="Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.">Romans 16:21</a>, and calls <span class="ital">Luke</span> [Lucas] his fellow-workman and the beloved Physician, <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-14.htm" title=" Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.">Colossians 4:14</a>. Now, whether he be only <span class="ital">Luke</span> [Lucas], or also <span class="ital">Lucius</span>, he is the very person who wrote the Acts of the Apostles, having accompanied Paul himself from the Troad, first to Philippi (<a href="/acts/16-10.htm" title="And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.">Acts 16:10</a>), next from Philippi to Troas, nay, even as far as to Rome (ch <a href="/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>, <a href="/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2 Timothy 4:11</a>): and it is owing to this that he most frequently uses the first person plural in his narrative. Moreover the lively [vigorous] style of Luke, which is particularly appropriate to the very joyful subject of the Acts, comprising, as they do, in their history the completion [carrying into effect] of the New Testament, seems to have derived some of its characteristics from the association of many years, which Luke maintained [enjoyed] with Paul.—Harm., pp. 35, 36. Lucas seems to me to be the contraction of Lucanus, as Silas from Silvanus, and to be altogether a distinct name from Lucius.—ED. and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand</span>. The Greek in which St. Luke's Gospel is written is generally pure and classical, but the language of the little introduction (verse 1-4) is especially studied and polished, and contrasts singularly with the Hebrew character of the story of the nativity, which immediately follows. St, Luke here, in this studied introduction, follows the example of many of the great classical writers, Latin as well as Greek. Thucydides, Herodotus, Livy, for instance, paid special attention to the opening sentences of their histories. The many early efforts to produce a connected history of the life and work of the great Master Christ are not, as some have supposed, alluded to here with anything like censure, but are simply referred to as being incomplete, as written without order or arrangement. They most probably formed the basis of much of St. Luke's own Gospel. These primitive Gospels quickly disappeared from sight, as they evidently contained nothing more than what was embodied in the fuller and more systematic narratives of the "four." <span class="cmt_word">Of those things which are most surely believed among us</span>. There was evidently no questioning in the Church of the first days about the truth of the story of the teaching and the mighty works of Jesus of Nazareth. It was the incompleteness of these first evangelists, rather than their inaccuracy, which induced St. Luke to take in hand a new Gospel. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Forasmuch as (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;)<p>Only here in New Testament. A compound conjunction: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;, since, &#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769;, as is well known, and &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;, giving the sense of certainty.<p>Have taken in hand (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Used by Luke only. A literal translation. The word carries the sense of a difficult undertaking (see <a href="/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>), and implies that previous attempts have not been successful. It occurs frequently in medical language. Hippocrates begins one of his medical treatises very much as Luke begins his gospel. "As many as have taken in hand (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;) to speak or to write concerning the healing art."<p>To set forth in order (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in New Testament. The A. V. is true to the core of the word, which is &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;, to put in order, or arrange. Rev. happily gives the force of the preposition &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768;, up, by the rendering draw up.<p>A declaration (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in New Testament. From &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;, through, and &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to lead the way. Hence something which leads the reader through the mass of facts: a narrative, as A. V., with the accompanying idea of thoroughness. Note the singular number. Many took in hand to draw up, not narratives, but a narrative, embracing the whole of the evangelic matter. The word was particularly applied to a medical treatise. Galen applies it at least seventy-three times to the writings of Hippocrates.<p>Which are most surely believed (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>From &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, full, and &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, the frequentative form of &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;, to bring, meaning to bring frequently or habitually. Hence, to bring full measure; to fulfil. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>. Also of full assurance. Applied to persons. <a href="/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>. As applied to things, therefore, the sense of the A. V. is inadmissible. Render as Rev., have been fulfilled. The word is chosen to indicate that these events happened in accordance with a preconceived design. Wyc., been filled in us.<p>Among us<p>Explained by the words in the next sentence, who were eye-witnesses and ministers. </body></html>
