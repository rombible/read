It originated obviously in the impression made by the horns of the bull or stag, as the symbols of strength. Here, following in the steps of the Psalmist, Zacharias uses it as a description of the coming Christ, who is to be raised up in the House of David.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:67-80 Zacharias uttered a prophecy concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah. The gospel brings light with it; in it the day dawns. In John the Baptist it began to break, and increased apace to the perfect day. The gospel is discovering; it shows that about which we were utterly in the dark; it is to give light to those that sit in darkness, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It is reviving; it brings light to those that sit in the shadow of death, as condemned prisoners in the dungeon. It is directing; it is to guide our feet in the way of peace, into that way which will bring us to peace at last, Ro 3:17. John gave proofs of strong faith, vigorous and holy affections, and of being above the fear and love of the world. Thus he ripened for usefulness; but he lived a retired life, till he came forward openly as the forerunner of the Messiah. Let us follow peace with all men, as well as seek peace with God and our own consciences. And if it be the will of God that we live unknown to the world, still let us diligently seek to grow strong in the grace of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hath raised up a horn - A horn is a symbol of strength. The figure is taken from the fact that in horned animals the strength lies in the "horn." Particularly, the great power of the rhinoceros or unicorn is manifested by the use of a single horn of great "strength," placed on the head near the end of the nose. When the sacred writers, therefore, speak of great strength they often use the word "horn," <a href="/psalms/148-14.htm">Psalm 148:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7-8</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>. The word salvation, connected here with the word "horn," means that this "strength," or this mighty Redeemer, was able to save. It is possible that this whole figure may be taken from the Jewish "altar." On each of the four corners of the altar there was an eminence or small projection called a "horn." To this persons might flee for safety when in danger, and be safe, <a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11</a>. So the Redeemer "may be" called the "horn of salvation," because those who flee to him are safe.<p>In the house - In the family, or among the descendants of David. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>69. horn of salvation&#8212;that is "strength of salvation," or "mighty Salvation," meaning the Saviour Himself, whom Simeon calls "Thy Salvation" (Lu 2:30). The metaphor is taken from those animals whose strength is in their horns (Ps 18:2; 75:10; 132:17).<p>house of &#8230; David&#8212;This shows that Mary must have been known to be of the royal line, independent of Joseph; of whom Zacharias, if he knew anything, could not know that after this he would recognize Mary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us,.... Meaning the Messiah, whom God had now raised up: <p>in the house of his servant David; in David's family, he being now conceived by a virgin of his house; and who, in a little time, would be born in Bethlehem, the city of David. He is called "an horn of salvation", because he is a powerful Saviour. "Horn" denotes power; it being that to a beast, as the arm is to a man, by which it defends itself, and pushes down its enemies; and "salvation" is the work Christ came to effect, and for which he was raised up, and sent: and a Saviour he is, and a mighty one, as appears from his doing and suffering what he has; as bearing all the sins of his people, and making reconciliation for them; obeying all the precepts of the law, and undergoing the penalty of it; being made a curse, and becoming obedient to death, even the death of the cross: as also, from his delivering them from sin, Satan, and the law, which no other could have done; and from his grappling with, conquering, spoiling, and destroying all his, and our enemies. Moreover, the word "horn" signifies regal power, honour, and dignity; see <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a> and so may not only denote the work of Christ as a Saviour, but his office also as a King, who in the discharge of that is likewise a Saviour; for he not only rules, and governs, but protects, defends, and preserves his, people, by his power; see <a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And hath raised up an <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</span><p>(i) This word horn, in the Hebrew language, signifies strength, and it is a metaphor taken from beasts that fight with their horns: And by raising up the might of Israel is meant that the kingdom of Israel was defended, and the enemies of it laid on the ground, even then when the strength of Israel seemed to be utterly gone.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/1-69.htm" title="And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;">Luke 1:69</a>. <span class="greekheb">κέρας σ</span>. = <span class="greekheb">βασιλείαν</span>, because kings were anointed with a horn of oil, or = <span class="greekheb">δύναμιν</span>, because in their horn all horned animals have their power (Euthy.
