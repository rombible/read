Christ must be born miraculously. The angel's address means only, Hail, thou that art the especially chosen and favoured of the Most High, to attain the honour Jewish mothers have so long desired. This wondrous salutation and appearance troubled Mary. The angel then assured her that she had found favour with God, and would become the mother of a son whose name she should call Jesus, the Son of the Highest, one in a nature and perfection with the Lord God. JESUS! the name that refreshes the fainting spirits of humbled sinners; sweet to speak and sweet to hear, Jesus, a Saviour! We know not his riches and our own poverty, therefore we run not to him; we perceive not that we are lost and perishing, therefore a Saviour is a word of little relish. Were we convinced of the huge mass of guilt that lies upon us, and the wrath that hangs over us for it, ready to fall upon us, it would be our continual thought, Is the Saviour mine? And that we might find him so, we should trample on all that hinders our way to him. Mary's reply to the angel was the language of faith and humble admiration, and she asked no sign for the confirming her faith. Without controversy, great was the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, 1Ti 3:16. Christ's human nature must be produced so, as it was fit that should be which was to be taken into union with the Divine nature. And we must, as Mary here, guide our desires by the word of God. In all conflicts, let us remember that with God nothing is impossible; and as we read and hear his promises, let us turn them into prayers, Behold the willing servant of the Lord; let it be unto me according to thy word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy cousin Elizabeth ... - The case of Elizabeth is mentioned to inspire Mary with confidence, and to assure her that what was now promised would be fulfilled.

Thus it may be either a word or a saying. Sometimes a phrase, as opposed to &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, a single word. The distinction in the New Testament is not sharp throughout. It is maintained that &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; in the New Testament, like the Hebrew gabar, stands sometimes for the subject-matter of the word; the thing, as in this passage. But there are only two other passages in the New Testament where this meaning is at all admissible, though the word occurs seventy times. These are <a href="/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15</a>; <a href="/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>. "Kept all these things" (<a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>), should clearly be sayings, as the A. V. itself has rendered it in the almost identical passage, <a href="/luke/2-51.htm">Luke 2:51</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/5-32.htm">Acts 5:32</a>, Rev. gives sayings in margin. In <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15</a>, though A. V. and Rev. render thing, the sense is evidently saying, as appears both from the connection with the angelic message and from the following words, which has come to pass: the saying which has become a fact. The Rev. rendering of this passage is, therefore, right, though a little stilted: No word of God shall be void of power; for the A. V. errs in joining &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; and &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, not every, and translating nothing. The two do not belong together. The statement is, Every (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;) word of God shall not (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba;) be powerless. The A. V. also follows the reading, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, with God; but all the later texts read &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, from God, which fixes the meaning beyond question. </body></html>
