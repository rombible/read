On Mary's arrival, Elisabeth was conscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the great Redeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and under his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were most blessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most High God. Mary, animated by Elisabeth's address, and being also under the influence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, and gratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, and that she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in his salvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need of Christ, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fills with good things, with the best things; and they are abundantly satisfied with the blessings he gives.

What beautiful superiority to envy have we here! High as was the distinction conferred upon herself, Elisabeth loses sight of it altogether, in presence of one more honored still; upon whom, with her unborn Babe, in an ecstasy of inspiration, she pronounces a benediction, feeling it to be a wonder unaccountable that "the mother of her Lord should come to her."

The words which clothed the thoughts in these ecstatic expressions of intense joy and thankfulness on the part of the two favored women, Mary and Elisabeth, are in great measure drawn from hymn and song contained in the Old Testament Scriptures. The song of Hannah, the hymn of Deborah, many of the psalms, the songs of the Canticles, the more glorious of the prophetic utterances, had been ever familiar to both these true women of the people; and they could find no language so fitting as the words of these loved national songs to express the intense joy, the deep awe and gratitude of their hearts. Think what must have been the feeling of the two - the one finding herself the chosen out of all the thousands of Israel, after so many centuries of weary waiting, to be the mother of the Messiah; the other, long after any reasonable hope of any offspring at all had faded away, to be the mother of Messiah's chosen friend, his herald, and his preacher, the mighty forerunner of the King of whom the prophets had written! <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>She spake out with a loud voice (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>For &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;, voice, read &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;, cry: inarticulate, though &#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769; may also be used of inarticulate utterance.

Elizabeth's sudden and violent emotion at the appearance of Mary, and the movement of the child, prompted an exclamation which was followed by words (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;, said).
