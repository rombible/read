Probably, Mary had now in her eye her miraculous conception of the Messiah, being astonished that God should have chosen her, a person of the meanest condition, to be his mother. Yet from her belief of the divine perfections, she was convinced that all was done in wisdom and truth, and therefore she adds, <span class="ital">and holy is his name. And his mercy is on them that fear him </span>— It always has been so; he has ever looked on them with an eye of peculiar favour, who have looked up to him with an eye of filial fear. But he hath manifested his mercy, so as he had never done before, in sending his Son to bring in an everlasting righteousness, and work out an everlasting salvation for them that fear him, and this <span class="ital">from generation to generation: </span>for there are gospel privileges, transmitted by entail, and intended for perpetuity. Those that fear God, as their Creator and Judge, are encouraged to hope for mercy from him, through their Mediator and Advocate; and in him mercy is settled upon all such, while the world stands. In Christ he keepeth mercy for thousands. <span class="ital">He hath showed strength with his arm </span>— That is, he hath shown the exceeding greatness of his power. She speaks prophetically of those things as already done which God was about to do by the Messiah. Grotius observes, that God’s great power is represented by his <span class="ital">finger, </span>his greater by his <span class="ital">hand, </span>and his greatest by his <span class="ital">arm. </span>The production of lice was by the finger of God, <a href="/exodus/7-18.htm" title="And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.">Exodus 7:18</a>; and the other miracles in Egypt were done by his right hand, <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm" title="And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the middle thereof: and after that he will let you go.">Exodus 3:20</a>.

Wherefore the virgin’s meaning is, that in this dispensation of his providence, God mightily manifested his sovereign power. <span class="ital">He hath scattered the proud, </span>&c. — In the course of God’s providence it is his usual method to cross the expectations of men, and proceed quite otherwise than they promise themselves. Proud men expect with ease to effect their purposes, and carry all before them; but he <span class="ital">scatters </span>them <span class="ital">in the imagination of their hearts; </span>breaks their measures, blasts their projects; nay, and brings them low by those very counsels, with which they thought to advance and establish themselves.

On Mary's arrival, Elisabeth was conscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the great Redeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and under his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were most blessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most High God. Mary, animated by Elisabeth's address, and being also under the influence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, and gratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, and that she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in his salvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need of Christ, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fills with good things, with the best things; and they are abundantly satisfied with the blessings he gives. He will satisfy the desires of the poor in spirit who long for spiritual blessings, while the self-sufficient shall be sent empty away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that is mighty - God.<p>Hath done to me great things - Hath conferred on me great favors and distinguished mercies.<p>And holy is his name - This is an expression of Mary's feelings, desiring to bestow on God all honor and praise. As the highest honor, she declared that his "name" was "holy" - that is, that God was free from sin, injustice, and impurity. The "name" of God is often put for God Himself. The proper name of God is &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  Yahweh, a word expressive of His "essential being," derived from the word "to be," <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/83-18.htm">Psalm 83:18</a>.

This may also have regard to the great things God had done for her in a spiritual sense; in the choice of her to eternal life, in the redemption of her by the Messiah, and in her regeneration and sanctification; wherein God had displayed his sovereign grace and goodness, and his almighty power, in a way consistent with his justice and holiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/luke/1-49.htm" title="For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name.">Luke 1:49</a> f. <span class="ital">Because the Mighty One did to me great things</span>, in making me the mother of the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἅγιον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] not for <span class="greekheb">οὗ τὸ ὄν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span> (Luther, Castalio, Bengel, and many, including Kuinoel), but lyrically unperiodic: <span class="ital">and holy is His name!</span> Hence, also, a full stop is not to be placed after <span class="greekheb">δυνατός</span> (Lachmann, Tischendorf, Bleek), but only a comma.

His power or might, alluding to the words of the angel (verse 85), "The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee." Surely in all the records of the Lord's works since the world's creation, his might had been never shown as it was now about to be manifest in her. His holiness had been displayed to her in the way in which the mighty acts of ineffable love had been carried out. His mercy: this attribute of God came home with intense power to the heart of the Jewish girl, into which God's protecting Spirit was shining with so clear a light. She saw something of the great redemption mystery which was then in so strange a way developing itself. </body></html>
