The past tense (in the Greek the aorist) is used by Zacharias as, in the joy of prophetic foresight, seeing the end of what had been begun.

Israel, as a chosen people, was a type of the people of God to be called out of all nations and ages, whom God had a particular eye to in sending the Saviour. <span class="ital">For he hath visited, &c., his people </span>— In sending the Messiah, God made a gracious visit to his people, whom, for many ages, he had seemed to neglect, and be estranged from. He is said to have visited his people in bondage, when he delivered them, <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm" title="Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:">Exodus 3:16</a>; to have visited them in famine, when he gave them bread, <a href="/ruth/1-6.htm" title="Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.">Ruth 1:6</a>.

And redeemed his people </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εποιησε λυτρωσιν τω λαω αυτου</span>. He hath wrought out redemption for his people, complete and illustrious redemption. This was the errand on which Christ came into the world, to redeem those that were sold for sin and sold under sin; even God’s own people, his Israel, need to be redeemed, and are undone if they be not. Christ redeems them by price out of the hands of God’s justice, and redeems them by power out of the hands of Satan’s tyranny, as Israel out of Egypt. <span class="ital">And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us </span>— That is, a mighty, victorious, and glorious Saviour, who saves his people with an abundant salvation. The expression is metaphorical, taken from beasts, whose strength, defence, and victory over other animals, lies chiefly in their horns, as also the beauty and glory of several of them; the property likewise of the ancients consisting chiefly in their flocks and herds. Accordingly, the word <span class="ital">horn </span>is used in Scripture emblematically, to denote strength or power, <a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm" title="He has cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about.">Lamentations 2:3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm" title="The LORD has done that which he had devised; he has fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he has thrown down, and has not pitied: and he has caused your enemy to rejoice over you, he has set up the horn of your adversaries.">Lamentations 2:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-10.htm" title="All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.">Psalm 75:10</a>; also honour and triumph, as, when the <span class="ital">horn is exalted, </span><a href="/psalms/89-24.htm" title="But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.">Psalm 89:24</a>. From the union of these, it signifies the power of a king or kingdom, <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>. This is the chief import of the word in this place, the house of David being the regal family, and the word <span class="ital">Saviour, </span>implying deliverer, protector, and ruler; the <span class="ital">horn of salvation in the house of David </span>denotes the kingdom of Christ. <span class="ital">As he spake </span>— That is, as he promised; <span class="ital">by his holy prophets, which have been since the world began </span>— <span class="greekheb">Απ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">αιωνος</span>, <span class="ital">from the beginning of ages, </span>the promise being made to Adam, <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>, that <span class="ital">the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head; </span>and to Abraham and the other patriarchs, that in their <span class="ital">seed all nations of the earth</span> <span class="ital">should be blessed. </span>“It cannot,” however, as Dr. Doddridge justly observes, “certainly be inferred from hence, as some have argued, that there was from the beginning of the world a series of prophets, or that every individual prophet spoke of the Messiah, which can never be proved without doing great violence to the remaining writings of some of them.” The words of Zacharias only amount to this, that the generality of prophecies in all ages refer to this great event. See <a href="/acts/10-43.htm" title="To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins.">Acts 10:43</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:67-80 Zacharias uttered a prophecy concerning the kingdom and salvation of the Messiah. The gospel brings light with it; in it the day dawns. In John the Baptist it began to break, and increased apace to the perfect day. The gospel is discovering; it shows that about which we were utterly in the dark; it is to give light to those that sit in darkness, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It is reviving; it brings light to those that sit in the shadow of death, as condemned prisoners in the dungeon. It is directing; it is to guide our feet in the way of peace, into that way which will bring us to peace at last, Ro 3:17. John gave proofs of strong faith, vigorous and holy affections, and of being above the fear and love of the world. Thus he ripened for usefulness; but he lived a retired life, till he came forward openly as the forerunner of the Messiah. Let us follow peace with all men, as well as seek peace with God and our own consciences. And if it be the will of God that we live unknown to the world, still let us diligently seek to grow strong in the grace of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>.<p>Hath visited - The word here rendered "visited" means properly "to look upon;" then to look upon in order "to know the state of anyone;" then to visit for the purpose of "aiding those who need aid," or alleviating misery. Compare <a href="/matthew/25-43.htm">Matthew 25:43</a>. In this sense it is used here. God "looked upon" the world - he saw it miserable - he came to relieve it, and brought salvation.<p>And redeemed - That is, was "about to redeem," or had given the pledge that he "would redeem." This was spoken under the belief that the Messiah, "the Redeemer," was about to appear, and would certainly accomplish his work. The literal translation of this passage is, "He hath made a "ransom" for his people. A "ransom" was the "price" paid to deliver a captive taken in war. A is a prisoner taken in war by B. B has a right to detain him as a prisoner by the laws of war, but C offers B a "price" if he will release A and suffer him to go at liberty. The price which he pays, and which must be "satisfactory" to B - that is, be a "reason" to B why he should release him is called a "price" or "ransom." Men are sinners. They are bound over to just punishment by the law. The law is holy, and God, as a just governor, must see that the law is honored and the wicked punished; but if anything can be done which will have the same "good effect" as the punishment of the sinner, or which will be an "equivalent" for it - that is, be of equal value to the universe - God may consistently release him.<p>If he can show the same hatred of sin, and deter others from sinning, and secure the purity of the sinner, the sinner may be released. Whatever will accomplish "this" is called a "ransom," because it is, in the eye of God, a sufficient "reason" why the sinner should not be punished; it is an equivalent for his sufferings, and God is satisfied. The "blood of Jesus" - that is, his death in the place of sinners constitutes such a ransom. It is in their stead. It is for them. It is equivalent to their punishment. It is not itself a "punishment," for that always supposes "personal crime," but it is what God is pleased to accept in the place of the eternal sufferings of the sinner. The king of the "Locrians" made a law that an adulterer should be punished with the loss of his eyes. His "son" was the first offender, and the father decreed that his son should lose one eye, and he himself one also. This was the "ransom." He showed his "love," his regard for the honor of his law, and the determination that the guilty should not escape. So God gave his Son a "ransom" to show his love, his regard to justice, and his willingness to save people; and his Son, in his death, was a ransom. He is often so called in the New Testament, <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>.

In the Old Testament, God is said to "visit" chiefly for judgment, in the New Testament for mercy. Zacharias would, as yet, have but imperfect views of such "visiting and redeeming," "saving from and delivering out of the hand of enemies" (Lu 1:71, 74). But this Old Testament phraseology, used at first with a lower reference, is, when viewed in the light of a loftier and more comprehensive kingdom of God, equally adapted to express the most spiritual conceptions of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 68-70.

This was a form of blessing of long standing, <a href="/psalms/72-18.htm">Psalm 72:18</a> and very likely was in use, more or less, ever since Israel was distinguished from other nations, became a body politic, and were settled in the land of Canaan, in the enjoyment of peculiar privileges, both civil and religious; see other forms before it in <a href="/genesis/9-26.htm">Genesis 9:26</a> and now, this was very near being antiquated, and out of date; for upon the birth of Christ, the Son of God manifest in the flesh, the New Testament form of blessing runs, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a> The reason of its being now made use of might be, because the Messiah, the principal subject of this song, was peculiarly promised unto Israel, was raised up for them, and sent unto them. To bless God, is not to invoke a blessing on him; for there is none greater than he to ask one of; nor does he stand in need of any, being the Creator, who is blessed for ever in himself, and is the fountain of blessedness to his creatures: and therefore, also, cannot signify to confer a blessing on him, but to praise and glorify him, on account of the perfections of his nature, and the works of his hands; and to give thanks unto him for all mercies, spiritual and temporal; and especially for Jesus Christ, his mission, incarnation, and salvation by him, which are the things the God of Israel is blessed for in this song: <p>for he hath visited, and redeemed his people; as he did Israel of old, <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a> when the Lord looked upon them, and delivered them out of the bondage of Egypt, and which was a type and resemblance of redemption by Christ; and to which reference here seems to be had. The "people" here said to be visited, and redeemed, design all the elect of God, not only among the Jews, but Gentiles also; all those whom God has chosen to be his people, and has in his covenant taken and declared to be such; whom he has given to Christ, as his people and portion; for whose sins he was stricken, and made reconciliation, and whom he saves from their sins. The act of "visiting" them, as previous to redemption, may include God's look of love upon them from everlasting; his choice of them in Christ unto salvation; the appointment and provision of a Saviour for them; the covenant of grace made with them in Christ, the foundation and security of their salvation; and particularly the mission of Christ in human nature, in consequence of the council, covenant, and promise of God: or it designs his incarnation, for he was now actually conceived in the womb of the virgin: so that God had visited, and looked upon his people, and remembered his love and mercy, his covenant and promise to them: and the "redemption" of them, which was now said to be made, or done, because Christ was now sent to do it, and because it was as sure, as if it was done, intends the spiritual and eternal redemption of them by the price of his blood, from the slavery of sin, the bondage of the law, and curse of it, and the captivity of Satan, and a deliverance out of the hands of every enemy; a redemption which reaches both to soul and body, and secures from all condemnation and wrath to come; and includes every blessing in it, as justification, forgiveness of sins, adoption, sanctification, and eternal life; and is a plenteous, full, complete, and everlasting one. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God of Israel; for he hath <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> visited and <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> redeemed his people,</span><p>(g) That he has shown himself mindful of his people, to the extent that he came down from heaven himself to visit us in person, and to redeem us.<p>(h) Has paid the ransom, that is to say, the price of our redemption.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a> f.

It has been in use in Christian worship perhaps as far back as the days of St Benedict in the sixth century, and it was early recognised that it is the last Prophecy of the Old Dispensation, and the first of the New, and furnishes a kind of key to the evangelical interpretation of all prophecies. It is also a continual acknowledgment of the Communion of Saints under the two dispensations; for it praises God for the salvation which has been raised up for all ages out of the house of His servant David, and according to the ancient covenant which He made with Abraham (see <a href="/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm" title="And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.">Galatians 3:29</a>).

He hath visited; that is, after some four hundred years of silence and absence, the Holy One of Israel had again come to his people. About four centuries had passed since the voice of Malachi, the last of the prophets, had been heard. <span class="cmt_word">An horn of salvation</span>. A metaphor not unknown in classical writings (see Ovid, 'Art. Am.,' 1:239; Her., 'Od.,' 3. 21. 18), and a much-used figure in Hebrew literature (see, among other passages, <a href="/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2</a>l; <a href="/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>). The reference is not to the horns of the altar, on which criminals seeking sanctuary used to lay hold; nor to the horns with which warriors used to adorn  their helmets; but to the horns of a bull - in which the chief power of this animal resides. This was a figure especially familiar among an agricultural folk like the Israelites. "A rabbinic writer says that there are ten horns - those of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, the horn of the Law, of the priesthood, of the temple, and of Israel, and some add of the Messiah. They were all placed on the heads of the Israelites till they sinned, and then they were cut off' and given to the Gentiles" (Schottgen, 'Hor. Hebr.,' quoted by Dr. Farrar). <span class="cmt_word">In the house of his servant David</span>. Clearly Zacharias looked on Mary, as the angel had done (verse 32), as belonging to the royal house of David. </body></html>
