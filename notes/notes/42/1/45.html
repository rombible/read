On Mary's arrival, Elisabeth was conscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the great Redeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and under his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were most blessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most High God. Mary, animated by Elisabeth's address, and being also under the influence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, and gratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, and that she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in his salvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need of Christ, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fills with good things, with the best things; and they are abundantly satisfied with the blessings he gives. He will satisfy the desires of the poor in spirit who long for spiritual blessings, while the self-sufficient shall be sent empty away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed is she that believed - That is, "Mary" who believed what the angel spoke to her. She was blessed not only in the act of believing, but because the thing promised would certainly be fulfilled.<p>From these expressions of Elizabeth we may learn:<p>1. That the spirit of prophecy had not entirely ceased among the Jews.<p>2. That the Holy Spirit is the source of light, comfort, and joy.<p>3. That everything about the birth of Jesus was remarkable, and that he must have been more than a mere man.<p>4. That the prospect of the coming of the Messiah was one of great joy and rejoicing to ancient saints; and,<p>5. That it was a high honor to be "the mother" of him that should redeem mankind.<p>It is from "that honor" that the Roman Catholics have determined that it is right to worship the Virgin Mary and to offer prayers to her - an act of worship as idolatrous as any that could be offered to a creature. Because:<p>1. It is not anywhere commanded in the Bible.<p>2. It is expressly forbidden to worship any being but God, <a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>.<p>3. It is idolatry to worship or pray to a creature.<p>4. It is absurd to suppose that the Virgin Mary can be in all places at the same time to hear the prayers of thousands at once, or to aid them. There is no idolatry more gross, and of course more wicked, than to worship the creature more than the Creator, <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45. An additional benediction on the Virgin for her implicit faith, in tacit and delicate contrast with her own husband.<p>for&#8212;rather, as in the Margin, "that."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some will have this given as a reason why Elisabeth pronounced her blessed, because she believed that what God had said should have its effect; as, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/11-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which you have sucked.">Luke 11:27</a>,28</span>, when the woman blessed the womb that bare Christ, and the paps that gave him suck, Christ saith, <span class="ital">Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, </span> <span class="ital">and keep it.</span> Mary was blessed not in this so much, that she brought forth Christ, as in this, that she believed in him. The words are certainly a great confirmation of what the angel had before told her, and it must needs be a great satisfaction to her to hear to her kinswoman, by the Spirit of prophecy, coming extraordinarily upon her, confirming what the angel had before told her. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And blessed is she that believed..... Meaning Mary, a woman, a very young woman, and who had had things very incredible to nature and reason told her; and yet she believed, without objecting thereto, or requiring a sign; tacitly referring to the unbelief of Zacharias, who was a man, a man in years, a priest by office; and yet had been very incredulous, in a thing that was much more possible; because there had been instances of it before, in Sarah, Hannah, and Manoah's wife; than what was related to the virgin, of which there had been none; and which to reason, and with men, was impossible: and happy indeed is every one, that has true faith in any degree; for faith is the faith of God's elect, and is both a fruit and evidence of electing grace, which is the source of all blessings; it is the gift of God, and the operation of his Spirit, and can never be lost: many are the blessings such as believe are in the possession of, and openly entitled to; as the justification of their persons, the remission of their sins, their adoption into the household of God, liberty at the throne of grace, and a right to the eternal inheritance; they enjoy much solid peace, joy, and comfort in their own souls; bring much glory to God, and shall be saved in the Lord, with an everlasting salvation: <p>for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord: these words may be considered, either as the subject matter of her faith, and be rendered in connection with the former, thus, "blessed is she that believed, that there shall be a performance, &amp;c", being fully persuaded, that what the angel had told her, concerning the conception and birth of a son, concerning his name, and the greatness of his person, and the nature, extent, and duration of his kingdom, should be certainly and punctually fulfilled; or as a reason of her happiness, because there should be a sure accomplishment of them. Whatever God has spoken to any of his people, whether it be with respect to things temporal, spiritual, or eternal, shall be performed; as may be strongly concluded from the veracity of God, who cannot lie; and from his power, who is able to do all things; and from his faithfulness, which he will never suffer to fail; and from instances, and matters of fact; from the experience of the saints in all ages, who know, and are conscious to themselves, that not one of the good things the Lord God has spoken to them, has ever failed, but that all have come to pass; see <a href="/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/1-45.htm" title="And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.">Luke 1:45</a>. <span class="greekheb">μακαρία</span>, here, as elsewhere, points to rare and high felicity connected with heroic moods and achievements.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">because</span> or <span class="ital">that</span>, which? great conflict of opinion among commentators.
