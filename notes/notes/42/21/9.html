He answers with clearness and fulness, as far as was necessary to teach them their duty; for all knowledge is desirable as far as it is in order to practice. Though spiritual judgements are the most common in gospel times, yet God makes use of temporal judgments also. Christ tells them what hard things they should suffer for his name's sake, and encourages them to bear up under their trials, and to go on in their work, notwithstanding the opposition they would meet with. God will stand by you, and own you, and assist you. This was remarkably fulfilled after the pouring out of the Spirit, by whom Christ gave his disciples wisdom and utterance. Though we may be losers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot be losers by him, in the end. It is our duty and interest at all times, especially in perilous, trying times, to secure the safety of our own souls. It is by Christian patience we keep possession of our own souls, and keep out all those impressions which would put us out of temper. We may view the prophecy before us much as those Old Testament prophecies, which, together with their great object, embrace, or glance at some nearer object of importance to the church. Having given an idea of the times for about thirty-eight years next to come, Christ shows what all those things would end in, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the utter dispersion of the Jewish nation; which would be a type and figure of Christ's second coming. The scattered Jews around us preach the truth of Christianity; and prove, that though heaven and earth shall pass away, the words of Jesus shall not pass away. They also remind us to pray for those times when neither the real, nor the spiritual Jerusalem, shall any longer be trodden down by the Gentiles, and when both Jews and Gentiles shall be turned to the Lord. When Christ came to destroy the Jews, he came to redeem the Christians that were persecuted and oppressed by them; and then had the churches rest. When he comes to judge the world, he will redeem all that are his from their troubles. So fully did the Divine judgements come upon the Jews, that their city is set as an example before us, to show that sins will not pass unpunished; and that the terrors of the Lord, and his threatenings against impenitent sinners, will all come to pass, even as his word was true, and his wrath great upon Jerusalem.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Commotions - Insurrections.

Time is the best interpreter of prophecies: what shall be seen of these before the end of the world we are yet to observe, but the destruction of Jerusalem is past many hundreds of years since. What commotions were before that, we must learn out of civil historians, who tell us of divers. Josephus telleth us of an insurrection made by those of Judea against the Samaritans, Romans, and Syrians; and of the Romans against the Jews, to the destruction of twenty thousand Jews: as also of those of Scythopolis, who destroyed of the Jews thirteen thousand; of the Ascalonites, who destroyed of them two thousand five hundred; of those of Alexandria, who destroyed of them fifty thousand; of those of Damascus, who slew of them ten thousand. They tell us also of many more seditions, during the government of Felix, Festus, Albinus, Florus, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The text speaks further of <span class="ital">earthquakes; </span> the Greek word signifieth no more than concussions and shakings, but historians tell us of several earthquakes that happened (though not in Judea) before the destruction of Jerusalem; one at Rome, in Nero’s time; another in Asia, which destroyed three cities, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For <span class="ital">famines, </span> we read of one in Scripture prophesied of by Agabus, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a></span>.

He tells us also of a neat beast bringing forth a lamb in the midst of the temple; of the strange opening of the gates of the temple; of visions of chariots and armed men; of a voice heard in the temple, inviting those who were there to be gone; as also of a man (whom he names) who for seven years and five months together before the siege went about crying, <span class="ital">Woe, woe to Jerusalem!</span> And could with no punishments (which they thought fit to inflict) be restrained, &c.

The Fall of Jerusalem was the Close of that Aeon and a symbol of the Final End (<span class="ital">telos</span>). This appears most clearly in the report of St Luke.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">commotions</span>]<span class="ital"> akatastasias</span>, conditions of instability and rottenness, the opposite to <span class="ital">peace.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm" title="For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>; <a href="/james/3-16.htm" title="For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.">James 3:16</a>. Such commotions were the massacre of 20,000 Jews in their fight with the Gentiles at Caesarea; the assassinations or suicides of Nero, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius; the civil wars, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be not terrified</span>] The Greek word is the exact equivalent of our English word ‘be not <span class="ital">scared,’ <a href="/luke/24-37.htm" title="But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.">Luke 24:37</a></span>; <a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm" title="Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.">1 Peter 3:6</a><span class="ital">;</span> <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm" title="Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.">Proverbs 3:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but the end is not by and by</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">but not immediately is the end. </span>For ‘by and by’ see <a href="/luke/17-7.htm" title="But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?">Luke 17:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-21.htm" title="Yet has he not root in himself, but endures for a while: for when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, by and by he is offended.">Matthew 13:21</a>; <a href="/mark/6-25.htm" title="And she came in straightway with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that you give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.">Mark 6:25</a>. The words are most important as a warning against the same eschatological excitement which St Paul discourages in 2 Thess.

The things which ‘must first come to pass’ before the <span class="ital">final</span> end were (1) physical disturbances—which so often synchronise with historic crises, as Niebuhr has observed; (2) persecutions; (3) apostasy; (4) wide evangelisation; (5) universal troubles of war, &c.
