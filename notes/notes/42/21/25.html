See on <a href="/context/mark/13-24.htm" title="But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,...">Mark 13:24-26</a>, and <a href="/context/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:...">Matthew 24:29-31</a>. <span class="ital">Men’s hearts failing them for fear </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">αποψυχοντων ανθρωπων απο φοβου</span>, literally, <span class="ital">men expiring through fear; </span>and <span class="ital">for looking after those things </span>— Those dreadful calamities; <span class="ital">which are coming on the earth — </span>Or, on the land. <span class="ital">For the powers of heaven shall be shaken </span>— For this shall not be like former invasions, or captivities, which only produced some transient disorders in the state, or at most an interruption in the government for a few years; but it shall be attended with a total subversion of it; even of the whole Jewish polity, laws, and religion, which were the work of heaven, or which, containing in them the light of truth, are signified by the sun, moon, and stars in the preceding verse; and therefore might in this be called <span class="ital">the powers of heaven. </span>The consequence shall be such vast, extensive, and lasting ruin, that it shall be a most lively emblem of the desolation of the whole world at the last day. The above is the exposition commonly given of these verses, compared with the parallel passages in Matthew and Mark. And in consistency therewith, <span class="greekheb">επι της γης</span>, which our translation renders, <span class="ital">upon the earth, </span>is thought to be only intended of the land of Judea and Samaria. But Dr. Campbell thinks the prophecy is not to be confined to that country, and therefore he prefers the common version, for which he assigns the following reasons: “First, though what preceded seems peculiarly to concern the Jews, what follows appears to have a more extensive object, and to relate to the nations and the inhabitable earth in general. There we hear of <span class="greekheb">συνοχη εθνων</span>, <span class="ital">distress, or anguish of nations, </span>and of the things, <span class="greekheb">επερχομενων τη οικουμενη</span>, <span class="ital">coming upon the habitable world; </span>not to mention what immediately follows, to wit, that the Son of man shall be seen coming in a cloud, with great glory and power. Nor is it all probable that, by the term, <span class="greekheb">εθνων</span>, <span class="ital">nations, </span>used thrice in the preceding verse, manifestly for Gentiles, are meant in this verse only Jews and Samaritans. Secondly, the prediction which the verse under examination introduces, is accurately distinguished by the historian, as not commencing till after the completion of the former. It was not till after the calamities which were to befall the Jews should be ended; after their capital and temple, their last resource, should be invested and taken, and the wretched inhabitants destroyed, or carried captive into all nations; after Jerusalem should be trodden by the Gentiles; nay, and after the triumph of the Gentiles should be brought to a period; that the prophecy contained in this and the two subsequent verses should begin to take effect. The judicious reader, to be convinced of this, needs only give the passage an attentive perusal.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:5-28 With much curiosity those about Christ ask as to the time when the great desolation should be. He answers with clearness and fulness, as far as was necessary to teach them their duty; for all knowledge is desirable as far as it is in order to practice. Though spiritual judgements are the most common in gospel times, yet God makes use of temporal judgments also. Christ tells them what hard things they should suffer for his name's sake, and encourages them to bear up under their trials, and to go on in their work, notwithstanding the opposition they would meet with. God will stand by you, and own you, and assist you. This was remarkably fulfilled after the pouring out of the Spirit, by whom Christ gave his disciples wisdom and utterance. Though we may be losers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot be losers by him, in the end. It is our duty and interest at all times, especially in perilous, trying times, to secure the safety of our own souls. It is by Christian patience we keep possession of our own souls, and keep out all those impressions which would put us out of temper. We may view the prophecy before us much as those Old Testament prophecies, which, together with their great object, embrace, or glance at some nearer object of importance to the church. Having given an idea of the times for about thirty-eight years next to come, Christ shows what all those things would end in, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the utter dispersion of the Jewish nation; which would be a type and figure of Christ's second coming. The scattered Jews around us preach the truth of Christianity; and prove, that though heaven and earth shall pass away, the words of Jesus shall not pass away. They also remind us to pray for those times when neither the real, nor the spiritual Jerusalem, shall any longer be trodden down by the Gentiles, and when both Jews and Gentiles shall be turned to the Lord. When Christ came to destroy the Jews, he came to redeem the Christians that were persecuted and oppressed by them; and then had the churches rest. When he comes to judge the world, he will redeem all that are his from their troubles. So fully did the Divine judgements come upon the Jews, that their city is set as an example before us, to show that sins will not pass unpunished; and that the terrors of the Lord, and his threatenings against impenitent sinners, will all come to pass, even as his word was true, and his wrath great upon Jerusalem.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>.<p>Upon the earth distress of nations - Some have proposed to render the word "earth" by "land," confining it to Judea. It often has this meaning, and there seems some propriety in so using it here. The word translated "distress" denotes anxiety of mind - such an anxiety as people have when they do not know what to do to free themselves from calamities; and it means here that the calamities would be so great and overwhelming that they would not know what to do to escape. There would be a want of counsel, and deep anxiety at the impending evils.<p>With perplexity - Rather "on account" of their perplexity, or the desperate state of their affairs. The Syriac has it, "perplexity or wringing of hands," which is a sign of deep distress and horror.<p>The sea and the waves roaring - This is not to be understood literally, but as an image of great distress. Probably it is designed to denote that these calamities would come upon them like a deluge. As when in a storm the ocean roars, and wave rolls on wave and dashes against the shore, and each succeeding surge is more violent than the one that preceded it, so would the calamities come upon Judea. They would roll over the whole land, and each wave of trouble would be more violent than the one that preceded it, until the whole country would be desolate.

The Genitive of the object may seem, no doubt, in this passage to give an unusual and forced (strained) construction, because <span class="greekheb">ἀπορία</span>, if it denotes <span class="ital">want</span> [as here, <span class="ital">want of means of escape, and of knowledge what to do</span>], is wont to have the Genitive of the subject-matter [the object of the want], as <span class="greekheb">ἀπορία σίτου</span>, <span class="greekheb">χρημάτων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; but there is no deficiency of analogous phrases, such as, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ἘΞΟΥΣΊΑ ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>, “power <span class="ital">over</span> you,” <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?

And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory</span>. The Lord continues his solemn prophecy respecting things to come. Now, the question of the four disciples - to Which this great discourse was the answer - was, When were they to look for that awful ruin of city and temple of which their loved Master spoke? <span class="accented">But they, it must be remembered, in their own minds closely connected the temple's fall with some glorious epiphany of their Master, in which they should share.</span> He answers generally their formal question as to the temple, describing to them the very signs they are to look for as heralding the temple's fall. He now proceeds to reply to their real query respecting the glorious epiphany. <span class="accented">The temple's ruin</span>, that belonged to the period in which they were living; but the glorious epiphany, <span class="accented">that</span> lay in a far distance. "See," he said, "city and temple will be destroyed; this catastrophe some of you will live to see. The ruin will be irreparable; a new epoch will set in, an epoch I call 'the times of the Gentiles.' These once despised peoples will have their turn, for I shall be their Light. Ages will pass before these 'times of the Gentiles' shall be fulfilled, but the end will come, and then, and not till then, will the Son of man come in glory. Listen; these shall be the signs which shall herald this glorious advent: <span class="accented">Signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars."</span> St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>) supplies more details concerning these "signs." The sun would be darkened, and the moon would not give her light; the stars would fall from heaven. These words are evidently a memory of language used by the Hebrew prophets to express figuratively the downfall of kingdoms. So Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>)speaks thus of the destruction of Babylon, and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>) of the fall of Egypt (see too <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>). It is, however, probable that our Lord, while using language and figures familiar to Hebrew thought, foreshadowed a literal fulfillment of his words. So Godet, who picturesquely likens our globe just before the second advent to "a ship creaking in every timber at the moment of its going to pieces." He suggests that "our whole solar system shall then undergo unusual commotions. The moving forces (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), regular in their action tilt then, shall be, as it were, set free from their laws by an unknown power, and, at the end of this violent but short distress, the world shall see him appear" (see <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-12</a>, where it is plainly foretold that tremendous physical disturbances shall precede the second coming of the Lord). <span class="accented">The Son of man coming in a cloud.</span> The same luminous cloud we read of so often in the Pentateuch: the flames of the desert-wanderings; the pillar of cloud and fire; the same bright cloud enveloped the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration; it received him as he was taken up (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>). Nothing is said in this place as to any millennial reign of Christ on earth. The description is that of a transitory appearance destined to effect the work upon quick and dead - an appear-ante defined more particularly by St. Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Signs (&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>.<p>Distress (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;)<p>Only here and <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>.

Render perplexity for the roaring of the sea, etc. &#x397;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;, roaring, is properly a returned sound, an echo.
