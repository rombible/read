Here again we have a word common to the two writers just named. The motive of the derision lies on the surface. That they, the teachers of Israel, should be told that they were like the Unjust Steward, that they were wasting their Lord’s goods, that they must make friends with the unrighteous mammon of quite another kind than those whom they were wont to court—this was more than they could stand. They have felt the force of the rebuke, and therefore they stifle it with mockery—<p>“A little grain of conscience made them sour.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/16-14.htm" title="And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him....">Luke 16:14-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Pharisees, who were covetous </span>— Of a very worldly spirit; <span class="ital">heard all these things — </span>Namely, concerning the true use of riches, and the impossibility of men’s serving God and mammon at the same time; <span class="ital">and they derided him </span>— As a visionary, who despised the riches, honours, and pleasures of life for no other reason but because he could not procure them. The original word, <span class="greekheb">εξεμυκτηριζον</span>, is very emphatical, signifying, <span class="ital">they mocked him, </span>by a scornful motion of the mouth and nose, as well as by what they spake to him. The word might properly be rendered, <span class="ital">they sneered. </span>“There was a gravity and dignity in our Lord’s discourse which, insolent as they were, would not permit them to laugh out; but by some scornful air they hinted to each other their mutual contempt.” — Doddridge. <span class="ital">And he said, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men</span> — By shunning the company of sinners, and your care of external appearances, you make specious pretences to extraordinary sanctity before the world, and you seldom fail to acquire a great reputation for it.

For though you may have covered the foulness of your crimes with the painted cloak of hypocrisy, and by going about, thus adorned, have cheated those who look no further than the outside, into a high admiration of you, you cannot screen yourselves from the detection of God, whose eye penetrates through every covering, and who judges of things not by their appearances, but according to truth. <span class="ital">For that which is highly esteemed among men, </span>&c. — In consequence of which it comes to pass that he often abhors both men and things that are held in the highest estimation. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:13-18 To this parable our Lord added a solemn warning. Ye cannot serve God and the world, so divided are the two interests. When our Lord spoke thus, the covetous Pharisees treated his instructions with contempt. But he warned them, that what they contended for as the law, was a wresting of its meaning: this our Lord showed in a case respecting divorce. There are many covetous sticklers for the forms of godliness, who are the bitterest enemies to its power, and try to set others against the truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They derided him - The fact that they were "covetous" is here stated as the reason why they derided him, or, as it is literally, "they turned up the nose at him." They contemned or despised the doctrine which he had laid down, probably because it showed them that with their love of money they could not be the true friends of God, or that their profession of religion was really false and hollow. They were "attempting" to serve God and mammon, and they, therefore, looked upon his doctrine with contempt and scorn.<p>Justify yourselves - "Attempt" to appear just; or; you aim to appear righteous in the sight of people, and do not regard the heart.<p>That which is highly esteemed - That is, mere external works, or actions performed merely to "appear" to be righteous.<p>Is abomination - Is abominable, or hateful. The word used here is the one that in the Old Testament is commonly given to "idols," and denotes God's "abhorrence" of such conduct. These words are to be applied "chiefly" to what Jesus was discoursing about. There are many things esteemed among people which are "not" abomination in the sight of God; as, for example, truth, parental and filial affection, industry, etc. But many things, much sought and admired, "are" hateful in his sight. The love of wealth and show, ambition and pride, frivolous and splendid vices, and all the wickedness that people contrive to "gild" and to make appear like virtue - external acts that "appear" well while the heart is evil - are abominable in the sight of God, and "should be" in the sight of people.
