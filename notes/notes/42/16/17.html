Our first impression on reading the words here is that there is less logical sequence in their position. They seem unconnected with the teaching as to the mammon of unrighteousness. It is possible that here, as elsewhere, some links of the chain have been dropped; but the explanation that has been given of the preceding parable gives a sufficient connection. The scribes and Pharisees had been tampering with the sacredness of the laws which are not of to-day or yesterday—fixed as the everlasting hills—and they are told that their casuistry cannot set aside the claims of those laws in any single instance, such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as that which immediately follows.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:13-18 To this parable our Lord added a solemn warning. Ye cannot serve God and the world, so divided are the two interests. When our Lord spoke thus, the covetous Pharisees treated his instructions with contempt. But he warned them, that what they contended for as the law, was a wresting of its meaning: this our Lord showed in a case respecting divorce. There are many covetous sticklers for the forms of godliness, who are the bitterest enemies to its power, and try to set others against the truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. it is easier, &c.&#8212;(See on [1679]Mt 5:17, 18)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Neither do you scandalize me, as if I came to teach a new doctrine, contrary to the law and the prophets.

Its bearing here is very obscure, and its introduction in a connection to which it does not seem to belong is chiefly interesting as vouching for the genuineness of the <span class="ital">logion</span>. J.

Similarly they said that when God took the Yod (the “jot” of <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm" title="For truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one stroke or one pronunciation mark shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.">Matthew 5:18</a>) from the name Sarai, He divided it between Sarah and Abraham, since Yod= 10, and H = 5.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to fail</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">to fall</span>.

The law did not fall to the ground; its abrogation was only its absolute fulfilment in all its eternal principles. The best comment on the verse is <a href="/context/matthew/5-27.htm" title="You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:...">Matthew 5:27-48</a>. The bearing of these remarks on the previous ones seems to be that our Lord charges the Pharisees with hypocrisy and men-pleasing, because while they professed the most scrupulous reverence to the Law, they lived in absolute violation of its <span class="ital">spirit</span>, which was alone valuable in God’s sight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/16-17.htm" title="And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one pronunciation mark of the law to fail.">Luke 16:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span>) Although I, the Christ, am here, with the Gospel; yet I do not set aside the law; <a href="/context/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill....">Matthew 5:17-18</a>.

The mere temporary and transitory regulations will, of course, give place to a new order, but not the smallest part of one letter of the Divine moral Law will fail." "One tittle." This is the rendering of a Greek word the diminutive of "horn," which denoted the horn or extremity of a Hebrew letter, by the omission or addition of which - to give an instance  - the letter <span class="accented">d</span> becomes the letter <span class="accented">r</span>; thus with  the horn it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>, daleth, <span class="accented">d</span>; without the horn <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span>, resh, <span class="accented">r</span>. The heresiarch Marcion (second century) here, in his recension of St. Luke, changes the text thus: "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than for one <span class="accented">tittle of my sayings</span> to fail." Marcion, who refused fallow the Divine origin of any part of the Old Testament, was afraid of the testimony which this assertion of our Lord would give to the Divine authority of the Pentateuch. In illustration of his saying that the moral Law given to the Jews was changeless, and while earth endured would never fail, the Master instances one grave chapter of the Law with which there had been much tampering-that of divorce. "See," he said, "the new state of things which I am now teaching, instead of loosening the cords with which the old Law regulated human society, will rather tighten them. Instead of a laxer code being substituted, I am preaching a yet severer one. My law of divorce is a severer one than that written down by Moses." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Tittle<p>See on <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>.</body></html>
