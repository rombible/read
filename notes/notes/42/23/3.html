The Lord brings his designs to a glorious end, even by means of those who follow the devices of their own hearts.

The Jewish priests had expected that on their authority Pilate would at once order Him to execution; but, on the contrary, he meant first to hear the case, and asked them what accusation they brought, refusing to accept their bare assertion that He was “a malefactor.” Pilate only attends to the <span class="ital">third</span> charge, and asks Christ this question on the Roman principle that it was always desirable to secure the confession of the accused. We see from St John (<a href="/john/18-33.htm" title="Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?">John 18:33</a>) that Jesus had been led <span class="ital">into</span> the Praetorium while His accusers stayed without; that He had not heard their accusations (<a href="/john/18-34.htm" title="Jesus answered him, Say you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?">John 18:34</a>), and that Pilate was now questioning Him at <span class="ital">a private examination</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Thou sayest it</span>] For a fuller account of the scene read <a href="/context/john/18-33.htm" title="Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?...">John 18:33-38</a>. It is alluded to in <a href="/1_timothy/6-13.htm" title="I give you charge in the sight of God, who vivifies all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;">1 Timothy 6:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?</span> Pilate then went again into his judgment-hall, where he had left Jesus, but before going back he could not resist addressing an ironical word to the accusing Jews: "Take ye him, and judge him according to your Law" (<a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>), to which the Sanhedrists replied that they were not allowed to put any man to death, thus publicly confessing the state of comparative impotence to which they were now reduced, and also revealing their deadly purpose in the case of Jesus. Pilate, having gone into the judgment-hall again, proceeds to interrogate Jesus. The first two accusations he passes over, seeing clearly that they were baseless. The third, however, struck him. Art <span class="accented">thou</span>, poor, friendless, powerless Man, the King I have been hearing about? <span class="cmt_word">And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it</span>. St. Luke gives only this bare summary of the examination, in which the prisoner Jesus simply replies "Yes," he was the King. St. John (<a href="/john/18-33.htm">John 18:33-38</a>) gives us a more full and detailed account. It is more than probable that John was present during the interrogatory. In the sublime answers of the Lord, his words explanatory of the nature of his kingdom, which "is not of this world," struck Pilate and decided him to give the reply we find in the next verse. </body></html>
