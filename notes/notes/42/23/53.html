Christ was buried in haste, because the sabbath drew on. Weeping must not hinder sowing. Though they were in tears for the death of their Lord, yet they must prepare to keep holy the sabbath. When the sabbath draws on, there must be preparation. Our worldly affairs must be so ordered, that they may not hinder us from our sabbath work; and our holy affections so stirred up, that they may carry us on in it. In whatever business we engage, or however our hearts may be affected, let us never fail to get ready for, and to keep holy, the day of sacred rest, which is the Lord's day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-61</a> notes; <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/15-42.htm">Mark 15:42-47</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 23:47-56.

The last sad rites of love seem all to have been performed by friendly hands. Joseph and Nicodemus, and those with them, reverently took down the pierced and bleeding body; then, after the usual ablution, the sacred head was covered with the napkin, the <span class="accented">soudarion</span> (St. John), and the holy body was wrapped tenderly and carefully in broad bands of the finest linen, covered with thick layers of the costly aromatic preparation of which Nicodemus had laid up such ample store (St. John). This was to preserve the loved remains of the Master from any corruption which might set in before they could proceed with the process of embalming, which was delayed necessarily until after <span class="cmt_word">the</span> sabbath and Passover day were passed. St. John adds, "as the manner of the Jews is to bury," probably marking the Jewish custom of embalming and thus preserving <span class="cmt_word">the</span> body, as contrasted with burning, which was the Roman usage<span class="cmt_word">.

This seems not to have been an unusual practice with "the great" among the Jews. Josephus relates of Kings Uzziah and Manasseh that they were buried in their gardens ('Ant.,' 9:10 and John 10:3. 2). "He made his grave with the rich" (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Wherein never man before was laid</span>. St. John styles it "a new sepulchre." These details are given to show that the Lord's sacred body was not brought into contact with corruption. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Linen (&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51</a>; and compare <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>.<p>Hewn in stone (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;)<p>Only here in New Testament, and not at all in classical Greek. </body></html>
