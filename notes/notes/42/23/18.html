<span class="ital">saying, Away with this man </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αιρε τουτον</span>, <span class="ital">tolle istum in crucem, crucify this fellow; and release unto us Barabbas, who for a certain sedition, and for murder, was cast into prison </span>— Thus the Jewish rulers demanded the release of a notorious villain, who had really been guilty of the crime whereof they had falsely accused Jesus; had made an insurrection with some accomplices; and had also committed murder in the insurrection, a crime which, though their impudence exceeded all bounds, they durst not lay to Christ’s charge. For this infamous creature the people likewise begged life, preferring him to the Son of God, who had always made it his whole study to do them good! <span class="ital">Pilate, therefore, willing </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">desirous; to release Jesus, spake again to them </span>— Luke does not tell us what the governor said to the people, but the other evangelists have supplied that defect. See on <a href="/context/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would....">Matthew 27:15-25</a>, and <a href="/context/mark/15-6.htm" title="Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired....">Mark 15:6-15</a>. <span class="ital">But they </span>— Without so much as offering any further reason, persisted in their importunity; <span class="ital">and cried out as before, Crucify him, crucify him </span>— They not only would have him to die, but to die in the most ignominious and painful manner: nothing less will satisfy them than that he should be crucified. <span class="ital">And he </span>— Pilate; <span class="ital">said unto them the third time, Why? What evil hath he done </span>— Name his crime. What can you prove against him? <span class="ital">I have found no cause of death </span>— No cause why he should be put to death. We may observe here, as Peter, a disciple of Christ, dishonoured him by denying him thrice; so Pilate, a heathen, honoured Christ by thrice owning him to be innocent. <span class="ital">I will therefore </span>— As I said, (<a href="/luke/23-16.htm" title="I will therefore chastise him, and release him.">Luke 23:16</a>,) <span class="ital">chastise him </span>— By scourging, and then I hope your rage will be moderated, and you will be prevailed upon to agree that I should let him go, without any further punishment. But popular fury, the more it is complimented, the more furious it grows. Hence <span class="ital">they were instant with loud voices </span>— With great noises or outcries; not requesting, but <span class="ital">requiring that he might be crucified </span>— As if they had as much right at the feast to demand the crucifying of one that was innocent as the release of one that was guilty! <span class="ital">And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed </span>— Pilate at length yielded to their importunity, and consented to do what was contrary both to the conviction and inclination of his own mind, not having courage to withstand so strong a stream. <span class="ital">He gave sentence that it should be as they required </span>— Here we see <span class="ital">judgment turned away backward, </span>and <span class="ital">justice standing afar off, </span>for fear of popular fury! <span class="ital">truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. He released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, </span>&c. — Who hereby would be hardened in his wickedness, and do the more mischief; <span class="ital">whom they desired </span>— Being altogether such a one as themselves; <span class="ital">but he delivered Jesus to their will </span>— And he could not have dealt more barbarously with him than to deliver him to the will of them who hated him with a perfect hatred, and whose tender mercies were cruelties.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:13-25 The fear of man brings many into this snare, that they will do an unjust thing, against their consciences, rather than get into trouble. Pilate declares Jesus innocent, and has a mind to release him; yet, to please the people, he would punish him as an evil-doer. If no fault be found in him, why chastise him? Pilate yielded at length; he had not courage to go against so strong a stream.

Lk. makes this demand the voluntary act of the people. In the parallels (<span class="ital">vide</span> there) it is suggested to them by Pilate (Mt.), and urged on them by the priests.

St. John styles him a robber; this well describes the character of the man; a bandit chief who carried on his lawless career under the veil of patriotism, and was supported and protected in consequence by many of the people. The meaning of his name <span class="accented">Bar-Abbas</span> is "Son of a (famous) father," or possibly <span class="accented">Bar-Rabbas</span>, "Son of a (famous) rabbi." A curious reading is alluded to by Origen, which inserts before Barabbas the word "Jesus." It does not, however, appear in any of the older or more trustworthy authorities. Jesus was a common name at that period, and it is possible that "when Barabbas was led out, the Roman, with some scorn, asked the populace whom they preferred - Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ!" (Farrar.). That this reading existed in very early times is indisputable, and Origen, who specially notices it, approves of its omission, not on critical, but on dogmatic grounds. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>All together (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>The whole multitude (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) of them.
