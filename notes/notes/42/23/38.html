He only observes in general that there was a title placed over him, and by mentioning it together with the insults, insinuates that it was one of them. The Evangelist John has marked the particular time when the title was written and affixed, <a href="/luke/19-9.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, as much as he also is a son of Abraham.">Luke 19:9</a>.

The great thing he died to purchase and procure for us, is the forgiveness of sin. This he prays for. Jesus was crucified between two thieves; in them were shown the different effects the cross of Christ would have upon the children of men in the preaching the gospel. One malefactor was hardened to the last. No troubles of themselves will change a wicked heart. The other was softened at the last: he was snatched as a brand out of the burning, and made a monument of Divine mercy. This gives no encouragement to any to put off repentance to their death-beds, or to hope that they shall then find mercy. It is certain that true repentance is never too late; but it is as certain that late repentance is seldom true. None can be sure they shall have time to repent at death, but every man may be sure he cannot have the advantages this penitent thief had. We shall see the case to be singular, if we observe the uncommon effects of God's grace upon this man. He reproved the other for railing on Christ. He owned that he deserved what was done to him. He believed Jesus to have suffered wrongfully. Observe his faith in this prayer. Christ was in the depth of disgrace, suffering as a deceiver, and not delivered by his Father. He made this profession before the wonders were displayed which put honour on Christ's sufferings, and startled the centurion. He believed in a life to come, and desired to be happy in that life; not like the other thief, to be only saved from the cross. Observe his humility in this prayer. All his request is, Lord, remember me; quite referring it to Jesus in what way to remember him. Thus he was humbled in true repentance, and he brought forth all the fruits for repentance his circumstances would admit. Christ upon the cross, is gracious like Christ upon the throne. Though he was in the greatest struggle and agony, yet he had pity for a poor penitent. By this act of grace we are to understand that Jesus Christ died to open the kingdom of heaven to all penitent, obedient believers. It is a single instance in Scripture; it should teach us to despair of none, and that none should despair of themselves; but lest it should be abused, it is contrasted with the awful state of the other thief, who died hardened in unbelief, though a crucified Saviour was so near him. Be sure that in general men die as they live.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In letters of Greek ... - See the notes at <a href="/matthew/27-37.htm">Matthew 27:37</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 23:32-38, 44-46.

Thus our Lord reigned even on His Cross, according to the curious old reading of <a href="/psalms/96-10.htm" title="Say among the heathen that the LORD reigns: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.">Psalm 96:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐβασίλευσεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου</span> (LXX.), Regnavit a ligno.

Luke enumerates the languages in the order in which Pilate had arranged them.[261] That order was [if one is disposed to admit of conjecture.—<span class="ital">Harm</span>., p. 567] <span class="ital">Greek, Latin, Hebrew</span>. John arranges them according to the custom of the Hebrews, in the order of their nature and dignity. Both however adopt that order, in which Christ and His <span class="ital">cross</span> and <span class="ital">kingdom</span> were subsequently preached. The beginning was made in the Hebrew tongue: in the last times the Hebrews shall have the first place (the most prominent part to fill). The Roman tongue never occupied the first place; nor is it destined, after the destruction of Rome, to remain in great vigour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[261] Townson, in his Harmony of the Gospels, shows the probability that Matthew gave the <span class="ital">Hebrew</span> inscription, as in other particulars his Gospel has most of an Hebraic character, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Mark, in accordance with the Latin or Roman aspect of his Gospel, probably gave the Latin inscription, THE KING OF THE JEWS; and so no foreign word is found in this, supposing that this is the Latin. Pilate would scorn to introduce any word from another tongue in the inscription written in the language of dominant Rome. The brevity, too, accords with the genius both of the Latin and of the Evangelist’s own style. Luke follows Mark with <span class="ital">This is</span> (<span class="greekheb">οὖτός ἐστιν</span>, verse 35), brought down from above, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Thus the <span class="ital">Greek</span> is left for John, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. But Bengel’s view, given in the note, <a href="/john/19-19.htm" title="And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.">John 19:19</a>, that the words were the same in the three languages, is perhaps more probable. See his note.—E. and T.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS</span>. The older authorities omit "in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew," but the fact is indisputable, for we read the same statement in <a href="/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>, where in the older authorities the order of the titles is, "in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek." Such multilingual inscriptions were common in the great provincial cities of the empire, where so many nationalities were wont to congregate. The four reports of the inscriptions slightly differ verbally, not substantially. Pilate probably (see note on ver. 33, on effect of accurate rendering of <a href="/john/19-19.htm">John 19:19</a>, "and Pilate wrote a title also") wrote a rough draft with his own hand, "Rex Ju-daeorum hic est." One of the officials translated freely into Hebrew and Greek the Roman governor's Latin memorandum of what he desired to have written in black on the white gypsum-smeared board to be affixed to the upper arm of the cross. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (John).<br /><span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (Mark).<br /><span class="accented">Rex Judaeorum hic est</span> (Luke). Dr. Farrar suggests that the title over the cross was as above.
