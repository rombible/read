They probably mentioned Galilee, either to alarm Pilate, the Galileans being notorious for sedition and rebellion; or to influence him, knowing that he was prejudiced against the people of that country. Pilate, hearing of Galilee, asked whether the prisoner came out of that country? and, being informed that he did, he ordered him to be carried away immediately to Herod, who was then in Jerusalem. Perhaps he supposed that the prince, in whose dominions the sedition was said to have been raised, could be a better judge of the affair than he. Moreover, as Herod was a Jew, expert in the religion and customs of his country, the governor imagined, that he might have had influence with the priests to desist. Or, if at their solicitation he should condemn Jesus, Pilate thought to escape the guilt and infamy of putting an innocent person to death. He might also propose to regain Herod’s friendship, formerly lost, perhaps by encroaching on his privileges. But whatever was his motive, the king, who had of a long time desired to see Jesus, rejoiced at this opportunity; for he hoped he should have the pleasure of seeing him work some miracle or other. Nevertheless, because Herod had disregarded the admonitions of John the Baptist, and had been guilty of the heinous crime of putting him to death, Jesus, liberal as he was of his miracles to the poor and afflicted, would not work them to gratify the curiosity of a tyrant, nor so much as answered one of his questions, though, <a href="/luke/23-9.htm" title="Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.">Luke 23:9</a>, he proposed many to him, probably concerning the miracles which were reported to have been wrought by him. “In this our Lord followed the rule observed by God in the administration of his moral government. He bestows on men means, opportunities, and assistances, such as, if they improve them properly, will lead them to knowledge, holiness, and happiness. But, these being slighted by men, God, after waiting the determined time, for wise reasons, shuts up from them all the springs of grace, and leaves them hopeless of that salvation, which they have so long despised.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-5 Pilate well understood the difference between armed forces and our Lord's followers. But instead of being softened by Pilate's declaration of his innocence, and considering whether they were not bringing the guilt of innocent blood upon themselves, the Jews were the more angry. The Lord brings his designs to a glorious end, even by means of those who follow the devices of their own hearts. Thus all parties joined, so as to prove the innocence of Jesus, who was the atoning sacrifice for our sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I find no fault - I see no evidence that he is guilty of what you charge him with.

The Roman was interested in the poor Prisoner; perhaps he grudgingly admired him. He was so different to the members of that hated nation he had been brought into such familar contact with; utterly unselfish, noble with a strange nobility, which was quite unknown to officials and politicians of the school of Pilate; but as regards Rome and its views quite harm. less. The Roman evidently was strongly opposed to harsh measures being dealt out to this dreamy, unpractical, generous Enthusiast, as he deemed him. </body></html>
