Sitting at Christ's feet, signifies readiness to receive his word, and submission to the guidance of it. Martha was providing for the entertainment of Christ, and those that came with him. Here were respect to our Lord Jesus and right care of her household affairs. But there was something to be blamed. She was for much serving; plenty, variety, and exactness. Worldly business is a snare to us, when it hinders us from serving God, and getting good to our souls. What needless time is wasted, and expense often laid out, even in entertaining professors of the gospel! Though Martha was on this occasion faulty, yet she was a true believer, and in her general conduct did not neglect the one thing needful. The favour of God is needful to our happiness; the salvation of Christ is needful to our safety. Where this is attended to, all other things will be rightly pursued. Christ declared, Mary hath chosen the good part. For one thing is needful, this one thing that she has done, to give up herself to the guidance of Christ. The things of this life will be taken away from us, at the furthest, when we shall be taken away from them; but nothing shall separate from the love of Christ, and a part in that love. Men and devils cannot take it away from us, and God and Christ will not. Let us mind the one thing needful more diligently.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou art careful - Thou art anxious.<p>Troubled - Disturbed, distracted, very solicitous.<p>Many things - The many objects which excite your attention in the family. This was probably designed as a slight reproof, or a tender hint that she was improperly anxious about those things, and that she should, with Mary, rather choose to hear the discourses of heavenly wisdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41.

Our Saviour plainly blames Martha for her too great solicitude and trouble to provide a dinner, or supper, for him, who had meat to eat which she was not aware of, it being his meat and drink to do the will of his Father, and to preach the gospel. Interpreters much trouble themselves in determining what that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">one thing</span> is, which our Saviour here saith is <span class="bld">needful.</span> Some think our Saviour meaneth no more than, one dish is enough; but this certainly is too low a sense. Others would have this <span class="ital">one thing</span> to be a life of meditation and contemplation, and that this was that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">good part</span> Mary had <span class="bld">chosen.</span> If Mary had thus spent her whole life they might have said something for this. But certainly Mary’s choosing to take advantage of Christ’s company, rather to spend an hour or two in hearing of him, than in preparing a supper for him, will prove no such thing. I should interpret it generally, concerning the care of the soul with reference to eternity. That is certainly the one thing necessary, that was the better part, which Mary had chosen, as to which Christ would not discourage her, nor any way blunt the edge of those holy desires he had kindled in her, an effect of which study and care was her sitting at the feet of Christ to hear his word. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus answered and said unto her,.... Calling her by her name, and repeating it, Martha, Martha, which expresses great intimacy and friendship, and much earnestness, and, as it were, pitying her present situation and circumstances: <p>thou art careful and troubled about many things; intimating, that she was over anxious, and too solicitous, and more thoughtful and careful than she need be: he did not require such preparations for him, and so much attendance; she gave herself an unnecessary trouble in providing so many things for his entertainment, when less would have sufficed; so that instead of joining with her in her request, he reproves her for her over anxious care and solicitude, to have a nice and plentiful feast. The Persic version gives a sense quite contrary to the design of the text, rendering the words thus, "thou art adorned in all things, and hast the preference above many women". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/luke/10-41.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things:...">Luke 10:41-42</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περὶ πολλά</span>] Thou art anxious, and weariest thyself (art in the confusion of business) <span class="ital">about many things</span>, see <a href="/luke/10-40.htm" title="But Martha was encumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.">Luke 10:40</a>.

Aristoph. <span class="ital">Ran</span>. 1007.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς δέ ἐστι χρεία</span>] A contrast with <span class="greekheb">πολλά</span>: <span class="ital">but of one thing there is need</span>; one thing is necessary, that is to say, <span class="ital">as an object of care and trouble</span>. By these words Jesus, in accordance with the context, can mean nothing else than that from which Martha had withdrawn, while Mary was bestowing pains upon it—<span class="ital">the undivided devotion to His word for the sake of salvation</span>, although in tenderness He abstains from mentioning it by name, but leaves the reference of the expression, in itself only general, to be first discovered from the words which follow. In respect of the neuter <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> nothing is to be supplemented any more than there is in respect of <span class="greekheb">πολλά</span>. Following Gregory, Bede, Theophylact, Zeger, Michaelis, and others (comp. Erasmus in the <span class="ital">Annotations</span>), Paulus understands: <span class="ital">one dish</span>, “we need not many kinds,” and <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀγαθὴν μερίδα</span> is then taken as meaning <span class="ital">the really good portion</span>,[139] which figuratively represents the participation in communion with Jesus. The former, especially after the impressive <span class="greekheb">Μάρθα</span>, <span class="greekheb">Μάρθα</span>, would have been just as trivial and out of harmony with the serious manner of Jesus as the latter would have been discourteous to the well-intentioned hostess. Nachtigall also mistakes (in Henke’s <span class="ital">Magaz</span>. VI. p. 355), and Stolz agrees with him in interpreting: <span class="ital">one person is enough</span> (in the kitchen), in opposition to which the contrast of <span class="greekheb">πολλά</span> is decisive, seeing that according to it <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> must be <span class="ital">neuter</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀγαθὴν μερίδα</span>] <span class="ital">the good part</span>. That, namely, about which care and pains are taken, consists, according to the various <span class="ital">kinds</span> of these objects, of several <span class="ital">parts</span>. Mary has selected for herself among these, for her care and pains, the <span class="ital">good</span> part; and this is, in accordance with the subject, nothing else than precisely that <span class="greekheb">ἕν</span> which is necessary—<span class="ital">that</span> portion of the objects of solicitude and labour which is <span class="ital">the good one</span>, the <span class="ital">good portion</span>, which only <span class="ital">one</span> can be. More vaguely Grotius, Elsner, Kypke, Kuinoel, and others put it: the good <span class="ital">occupation</span>; and de Wette, generalizing this: the good <span class="ital">destination of life</span>. Comp. also Euthymius Zigabenus: <span class="greekheb">δύο μερίδες πολιτείας ἐπαινεταὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ μὲν πρακτική</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ θεωρητική</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀγαθήν</span>] neither means <span class="ital">optimam</span> (Kuinoel and others), nor does it imply that the care of Martha, in which assuredly love also was expressed, was <span class="ital">mala</span> (Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Conject</span>.

The various readings ‘but there is need of few things,’ or ‘of few things or of one’ (<span class="greekheb">א</span>, B, various versions, &c.) seem to have risen from the notion that even for the simplest meal more than one dish would be required. This, however, is not the case in the simple meals of the East.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that good part</span>] Rather, portion (as of a banquet, <a href="/genesis/43-34.htm" title="And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs.

It has been usual with Roman Catholic and other writers to see in Martha the type of the active, and in Mary of the contemplative disposition, and to exalt one above the other. This is not the point of the narrative, for both may and ought to be combined as in St Paul and in St John. The gentle reproof to Martha is aimed <span class="ital">not</span> at her hospitable activity, but at the ‘fret and fuss,’ the absence of repose and calm, by which it was accompanied; and above all, at the tendency to reprobate and interfere with excellence of a different kind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/10-41.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things:">Luke 10:41</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μάρθα</span>, <span class="greekheb">Μάρθα</span>, <span class="ital">Martha, Martha</span>) An Epizeuxis [the forcible repetition of the same word in the same sentence] calculated deeply to impress Martha’s mind.—<span class="greekheb">μεριμνᾷς</span>, <span class="ital">thou art careful</span>) inwardly.
