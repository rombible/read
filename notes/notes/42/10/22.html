But let us beware of spiritual pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21, 22. Jesus &#8230; said, &c.&#8212;The very same sublime words were uttered by our Lord on a former similar occasion (see on [1629]Mt 11:25-27); but (1) There we are merely told that He "answered and said" thus; here, He "rejoiced in spirit and said," &c. (2) There it was merely "at that time" (or season) that He spoke thus, meaning with a general reference to the rejection of His gospel by the self-sufficient; here, "In that hour Jesus said," with express reference probably to the humble class from which He had to draw the Seventy, and the similar class that had chiefly welcomed their message. "Rejoice" is too weak a word. It is "exulted in spirit"&#8212;evidently giving visible expression to His unusual emotions; while, at the same time, the words "in spirit" are meant to convey to the reader the depth of them. This is one of those rare cases in which the veil is lifted from off the Redeemer's inner man, that, angel-like, we may "look into it" for a moment (1Pe 1:12). Let us gaze on it with reverential wonder, and as we perceive what it was that produced that mysterious ecstasy, we shall find rising in our hearts a still rapture&#8212;"Oh, the depths!"<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 22. <span class="bld">See Poole on "Lu 10:21"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All things are delivered to me of my Father,....

This part of the devotional utterance, setting forth Christ’s faith in the purpose of His Father and the intimate fellowship subsisting between Father and Son, appears in some texts of Lk. as a declaration made to the disciples (<span class="greekheb">στραφεὶς πρὸς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">α</span>., T. R.). The gesture implies that a solemn statement is to be made.—<span class="greekheb">τίς ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ πατήρ</span>: to know who the Son or the Father is = knowing the Son and the Father. The idea in Lk. is the same as in Mt., though the expression is different.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">All things are delivered to me of my Father</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">were delivered to me by, </span>cf. <a href="/luke/20-14.htm" title="But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.">Luke 20:14</a><span class="bld">. </span>This entire verse is one of those in which the teaching of the Synoptists (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18</a>) comes into nearest resemblance to that of St John, which abounds in such passages (<a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/john/3-35.htm" title="The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.">John 3:35</a>; <a href="/context/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;...">John 5:26-27</a>; <a href="/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="/john/6-46.htm" title="Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.">John 6:46</a>; <a href="/context/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me....">John 14:6-9; Joh 17:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.

In the same way we find this view assumed in St Paul’s earlier Epistles (e.g. <span class="ital"><a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet.

These words, spoken late in the public ministry, evidently refer to the Almighty power possessed and frequently exercised by the incarnate Son of God. During the days of his humiliation, Jesus Christ exercised the power of Creator, Lord of the elements, Lord of the secrets of health and disease, Lord of life and death. Dean Mansel, comparing this statement, recorded both by SS. Matthew and Luke, with the language of St. John, remarks "that there is no substantial difference between the different evangelists in their views of our Lord's Person and nature, and that the Gospel of St. John, far from being the representative of a later theology,  does but more fully expound what is implicitly contained in the earliest of the Gospels." St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>) here gives us that sublime invitation of the Master's to the weary and heavy-laden. In the consciousness of his possession of all power, Jesus, with infinite compassion, offers to the great army of sufferers that rest which he alone can give. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Are delivered (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>See on <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>. </body></html>
