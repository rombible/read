The words that followed, “This do, and thou shalt live,” were those of a Prophet who knew what was in the man, and read the secrets of his heart, and saw how little love was to be found there. In the command “<span class= "ital">This do . . .</span> ,” however, our Lord does something more than accommodate Himself to the legal point of view. Love was really life, at once its source and its manifestation, if only the love were true, and the test of its being true was action.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:25-37 If we speak of eternal life, and the way to it, in a careless manner, we take the name of God in vain. No one will ever love God and his neighbour with any measure of pure, spiritual love, who is not made a partaker of converting grace. But the proud heart of man strives hard against these convictions. Christ gave an instance of a poor Jew in distress, relieved by a good Samaritan. This poor man fell among thieves, who left him about to die of his wounds. He was slighted by those who should have been his friends, and was cared for by a stranger, a Samaritan, of the nation which the Jews most despised and detested, and would have no dealings with. It is lamentable to observe how selfishness governs all ranks; how many excuses men will make to avoid trouble or expense in relieving others. But the true Christian has the law of love written in his heart. The Spirit of Christ dwells in him; Christ's image is renewed in his soul. The parable is a beautiful explanation of the law of loving our neighbour as ourselves, without regard to nation, party, or any other distinction. It also sets forth the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward sinful, miserable men. We were like this poor, distressed traveller. Satan, our enemy, has robbed us, and wounded us: such is the mischief sin has done us. The blessed Jesus had compassion on us. The believer considers that Jesus loved him, and gave his life for him, when an enemy and a rebel; and having shown him mercy, he bids him go and do likewise. It is the duty of us all , in our places, and according to our ability, to succour, help, and relieve all that are in distress and necessity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this subject explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. he said, &c.&#8212;"Right; This do, and life is thine"&#8212;laying such emphasis on "this" as to indicate, without expressing it, where the real difficulty to a sinner lay, and thus nonplussing the questioner himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto him, thou hast answered right,....

Our Lord intimates by this, that, according to the tenor of the law, eternal life was not to be had without a complete and perfect performance of the duties of love to God, and to the neighbour, contained in these words; and this he suggests, in order to convict him of the impossibility of obtaining life by the works of the law, since such a performance cannot be made by man. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/luke/10-28.htm" title="And he said to him, You have answered right: this do, and you shall live....">Luke 10:28-29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦτο ποίει</span>] <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> has the emphasis corresponding to the <span class="greekheb">τί</span> of <a href="/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ζήσῃ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσεις</span>, <a href="/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25</a>.

The learned Jew was evidently confounded at the Galilaean Rabbi's first answer referring him to the sacred Mosaic Law. His perplexity is increased by the Lord's quiet repartee when he had rehearsed the two duties, to his God and his neighbour, "This do, and thou shalt live." It seems as though the clever, unfriendly critic of Jesus of Nazareth now forgot the hostile purpose with which he stood up to question, and, really conscience-stricken, willing to justify himself, in real good faith put the query which called out the famous parable. </body></html>
