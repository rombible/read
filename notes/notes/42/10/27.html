No one will ever love God and his neighbour with any measure of pure, spiritual love, who is not made a partaker of converting grace. But the proud heart of man strives hard against these convictions. Christ gave an instance of a poor Jew in distress, relieved by a good Samaritan. This poor man fell among thieves, who left him about to die of his wounds. He was slighted by those who should have been his friends, and was cared for by a stranger, a Samaritan, of the nation which the Jews most despised and detested, and would have no dealings with. It is lamentable to observe how selfishness governs all ranks; how many excuses men will make to avoid trouble or expense in relieving others. But the true Christian has the law of love written in his heart. The Spirit of Christ dwells in him; Christ's image is renewed in his soul. The parable is a beautiful explanation of the law of loving our neighbour as ourselves, without regard to nation, party, or any other distinction. It also sets forth the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward sinful, miserable men. We were like this poor, distressed traveller. Satan, our enemy, has robbed us, and wounded us: such is the mischief sin has done us. The blessed Jesus had compassion on us. The believer considers that Jesus loved him, and gave his life for him, when an enemy and a rebel; and having shown him mercy, he bids him go and do likewise. It is the duty of us all , in our places, and according to our ability, to succour, help, and relieve all that are in distress and necessity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this subject explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

Lk. here puts into the mouth of the lawyer an answer combining as co-ordinate the religious and the ethical, which in the later incident reported in <a href="/context/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together....">Matthew 22:34-40</a>, <a href="/context/mark/12-28.htm" title="And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?...">Mark 12:28-34</a>, is ascribed to Jesus. The unity of these interests is, as Holtz. (H. C.) remarks, the achievement and characteristic of Christianity, and one may legitimately doubt whether a man belonging to the clerical class in our Lord’s time had attained such insight. Divorce of religion from morality was a cardinal vice of the righteousness of the time, and we see it exemplified in the following parable: priest and Levite religious but inhuman. In Lk.’s time the conception of religion and morality as one and inseparable had become a Christian commonplace, and he might have been unable to realise that there was a time when men thought otherwise, and so without any sense of incongruity made the lawyer answer as he does. But, on the other hand, it has to be borne in mind that even in our Lord’s time there were some in the legal schools who emphasised the ethical, and Mk. makes the scribe (<a href="/context/luke/12-32.htm" title="Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom....">Luke 12:32-33</a>) one of this type.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγαπήσεις</span>, etc.: <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> is here given, as in <a href="/mark/12-31.htm" title="And the second is like, namely this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
