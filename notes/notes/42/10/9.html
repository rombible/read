These were strangely great powers to confer upon poor weak men - men, too, only in the very dawn of faith - and their naive surprise and joy (see ver. 17) show how little they believed in their possession of such powers, even after their Master's words announcing to them the gift. But this prodigality of miraculous energy was needful then.
