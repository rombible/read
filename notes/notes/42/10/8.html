Matthew saith, —<span class="ital">inquire who in the city is worthy, </span> and, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/10-13.htm" title="Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.">Luke 10:13</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">if the house be worthy; </span> Luke saith, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">if the son of peace be there; </span> they both mean the same thing: if there be any in it, that belong to God’s election of grace, any whom God intends by you to call, and make partakers of the peace of the gospel. For other things relating to the opening of the words, see the notes before mentioned. Only we may from hence observe for our instruction, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That it is the will of Christ, that his ministers should not be too solicitous for a livelihood. As the labourer is worthy of his hire, so he that sends them into his harvest will see they shall be fed. Let them look to their calling, and to the fulfilling of their ministry; God will see they shall be fed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That the society of ministers of the gospel, in cities and houses, should not be with debauchees, but with those that are worthy, so far as man can judge; such as are their Master’s friends and servants should be their companions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Those are most worthy in places amongst whom the Son of peace is, men and women that have the most knowledge of and love for Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. The ministers of Christ ought to carry themselves with all imaginable civility, wishing good to all, and doing good to all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. Christ’s ministers ought not to make their bellies their gods, —<span class="ital">eat such things as are set before you.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. They have a Divine licence to take and use for their necessities such things as men give them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7. Christ expects that his people should maintain his ministers, not depriving the labourers of their hire, nor muzzling the mouths of the oxen which tread out the corn, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/9-9.htm" title="For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Does God take care for oxen?">1 Corinthians 9:9</a>,10</span>, nor preferring their servants for their worldly occasions before such as labour for their souls, and in that work are God’s messengers to them, and his servants in the first place, though employed in watching for people’s souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>8. The not giving a livelihood to ministers, is a not receiving them, that is, provided the people be able. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>9. People by not receiving the gospel of peace brought them by faithful ministers shall do them no hurt, their peace shall return unto them. They shall be a sweet savour unto God, even as to them that perish. Their judgment is with the Lord, and their work with their God, though they labour in vain; though Israel be not gathered, they shall be glorified. Men proportion their rewards according to successes of servants. God more justly proportions his rewards to men’s sincerity and diligence in their labour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>10. If men refuse the gospel, yet they shall know the kingdom of God is come nigh unto them. If they will not be subject to his kingdom of grace, yet they shall be subdued by the kingdom of his power and justice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>11. There will come a day when men that have the offers of the gospel of peace, and refuse them, slighting and despising his ministers and their message, will find that they had better have lived in Sodom when it was burnt with fire and brimstone; their portion of wrath in the day of judgment will be larger and bitterer than the portion of the men of Sodom. Let all who live in our days hear and fear, and in time break off their sins by a true repentance, lest they go to hell at the highest disadvantage. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And into whatsoever city ye enter,....

Most commentators have simply seen in this charge <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> an instruction to be content with whatever their host should set before them, avoiding even the appearance of caring or wishing for dainties; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that his servants should look upon such maintenance in the light of a fairly earned wage, rather than as an alms bestowed upon a beggar. In other words, his servants, while perfectly content with the most frugal fare, at the same time should preserve their manly independence. The bare austere sustenance, the simple lodging, - <span class="accented">these</span> things they had surely earned. But in addition to this meaning, true and appropriate though it be, there seems a quiet recommendation not to be rigid in inquiring as to the cleanness or uncleanness of the viands. One very able commentator (Godet) remarks that of this there is no question, for we are yet in a Jewish world. But remembering only in the last chapter a mission was specially sent to a Samaritan village, such an assertion can scarcely be maintained. It seems probable that extreme rigidness in this particular, now that mission work on a broad scale had commenced, here began to be relaxed; and that in this charge of Jesus we have, at least, the basis of that yet broader commandment set out by St. Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a>. </body></html>
