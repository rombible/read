But let us beware of spiritual pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/13-16.htm">Matthew 13:16-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23, 24.
