The chief publican was clearly not popular, and probably the priestly tone of the place (see Note on <a href="/luke/19-5.htm" title="And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at your house.">Luke 19:5</a>) gave additional strength to all caste feelings.

Christ invited himself to Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him. Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. He does not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by his good works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of his faith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he is turned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he brings salvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to save it. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other. He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Murmured - Found fault, complained.<p>To be a guest - To remain with, or to be entertained by.<p>A man that is a sinner - All publicans they regarded as great sinners, and the "chief" of the publicans, therefore, they regarded as especially wicked. It would appear also from Zacchaeus' confession that his character "had been" that of an oppressive man. But the people seemed to forget that he might be a penitent, and that the Messiah came to save that which was lost. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. to be guest&#8212;or lodge: something more than "eating with" such (Lu 15:2).<p>a sinner&#8212;that was one but a minute ago, but now is not.

But of what sort of people were these murmurers? The voice is the voice of Pharisees, who had often quarrelled at Christ for this, and of their disciples; for there were multitudes of the Jews that had drunk in the superstitions of that faction, and were more afraid of keeping company with sinners, than themselves being so; of having fellowship with their excommunicates in their houses, than of having fellowship with their, or greater, works of darkness. Our Saviour had before answered this cavil, he will now come to show them they were mistaken in the man; that he whom they counted a sinner, was a better man than themselves generally were. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they saw it,....
