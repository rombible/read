Surely those cannot be right who take up any doctrines of truth, so as to be hardened towards their fellow-sinners. But let every one remember, that though Jesus wept over Jerusalem, he executed awful vengeance upon it. Though he delights not in the death of a sinner, yet he will surely bring to pass his awful threatenings on those who neglect his salvation. The Son of God did not weep vain and causeless tears, nor for a light matter, nor for himself. He knows the value of souls, the weight of guilt, and how low it will press and sink mankind. May he then come and cleanse our hearts by his Spirit, from all that defiles. May sinners, on every side, become attentive to the words of truth and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 19:45-48.

Of the former we have but a slight and colourless presentation from Lk., whose editorial solicitudes, now well known to us, here come into play. The story as told by Mt. and Mk. shows passion (of the true Divine prophetic type) and action bordering on violence. This disappears from Lk.’s page in favour of a decorous but neutral picture. J. Weiss thinks it incredible that Lk. should have given us so inadequate a statement had he had such an account as that in Mk. before him (Meyer, eighth edition, note, p. 584). It is perfectly intelligible, once we understand Lk.’s method of handling his material. Equally groundless, for the same reason, is the inference of Hahn from the omissions of Lk. between <a href="/context/luke/19-44.htm" title="And shall lay you even with the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone on another; because you knew not the time of your visitation....">Luke 19:44-45</a> (<a href="/context/matthew/21-10.htm" title="And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?...">Matthew 21:10-11</a>, <a href="/context/mark/11-11.htm" title="And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about on all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve....">Mark 11:11-14</a>) that he cannot have known either Mt. or Mk.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">45, 46. </span>Final Cleansing of the Temple.<span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>45</span>. <span class="ital">he went into the temple</span>] The procession of Galilaean pilgrims would leave Jesus at the foot of Mount Moriah—(the ‘Mountain of the House,’ <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>), beyond which none might advance with dusty feet or stained by travel.

The needs of the pilgrims—the money which had to be changed—the purchase of cattle for sacrifice, &c.—had made the cloisters, precincts, and even the outer court of the Temple a scene of noisy and greedy barter, as the nave of St Paul’s used to be a few generations ago.

The recital of St. Luke here is more general and less precise than that of the other two synoptists. The Lord on that "Palm Sunday" evening simply went into the temple, ,, and when he had looked round about upon all things" it was then evening, and he returned to his lodging at Bethany with the twelve (<a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>). The expulsion of the money-changers, mentioned in the next verse (46), took place on the following day. St. Matthew adds another interesting detail respecting the excitement caused by the presence of Jesus in the city. "When he was come into <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?" (<a href="/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span> This visit of the Lord to the temple, in which he spoke and acted as King Messiah, was a fulfilment of <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1, 2</a>. In the outer court of the temple stalls had been erected in which money-changers were located (<span class="accented">geld-wechsel comptoir</span> - <span class="accented">change de monnaies</span>), in order that pilgrims from foreign lands might be able to exchange their foreign coins for the purchase of sacrificial victims. These also seem to have been sold in the precincts. All this made the courts of the Lord's house a scene of noise and tumult, and, from the Master's stern words, a scene often of cheating and overreaching. The words of Jesus were taken from <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>. </body></html>
