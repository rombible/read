Zaccheus, it seems, was in Jericho when Jesus passed through, though his house was farther on the road to Jerusalem. This accounts for his running before the multitude on this occasion. His desire to see Jesus was, no doubt, increased by the account which he had received in Jericho, of the miracle performed on the blind beggars; for the news of so extraordinary a transaction would be quickly spread abroad.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 Those who sincerely desire a sight of Christ, like Zaccheus, will break through opposition, and take pains to see him. Christ invited himself to Zaccheus' house. Wherever Christ comes he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him. Zaccheus gave proofs publicly that he was become a true convert. He does not look to be justified by his works, as the Pharisee; but by his good works he will, through the grace of God, show the sincerity of his faith and repentance. Zaccheus is declared to be a happy man, now he is turned from sin to God. Now that he is saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the power of them, all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come to his house, and where Christ comes he brings salvation with him. He came into this lost world to seek and to save it. His design was to save, when there was no salvation in any other. He seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who he was - Rather "what sort of person," he was, or how he appeared. He had that curiosity which is natural to people to see one of whom they have heard much. It would seem, also, that in this case mere "curiosity" led to his conversion and that of his family. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm">1 Corinthians 14:23-25</a>. God makes use of every principle - of curiosity, or sympathy, or affection, or hope, or fear - to lead people in the way of salvation, and to impress truth on the minds of sinners.<p>The press - The crowd; the multitude that surrounded Jesus. Earthly princes are often borne in splendid equipages, or even carried, as in Eastern nations, in palanquins on the shoulders of people. Jesus mingled with the multitude, not seeking distinctions of that sort, and perhaps, "in appearance," not distinguished from thousands that followed him.<p>Little of stature - Short.

All this was but curiosity; he saw a great crowd passing by, and asks what was the matter. The people tell him, that it was Jesus of Nazareth, that famous Prophet, whose fame had filled Judea as well as Galilee. He hath a great curiosity to see him, and runs before to find out a convenient station; but perceiving the crowd was great, and knowing that he was too low of stature to look over all their heads so well as to satisfy himself, he climbeth up upon a sycamore tree, by the way side in which he knew that he must pass. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sought to see Jesus who he was,.... What sort of a person he was for complexion, stature, and age: having heard much of him, he was very desirous of indulging his curiosity with a sight of him; having, as yet, nothing else that induced him to desire to see him: his desire to see Jesus was not of the same kind with the kings and prophets, <a href="/matthew/13-16.htm">Matthew 13:16</a> but rather like that of Herod,  <a href="/luke/23-8.htm">Luke 23:8</a><p>and could not for the press; the multitude of people that were flocking to meet Jesus, or who came before him, or were about him; for one part of the multitude went before him, and the other followed after him; so that he was in the crowd, and therefore could not easily be seen; <p>because he was little of stature. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "because Zacchaeus was little of stature", lest it should be thought that this is said of Jesus; for the reason why Zacchaeus could not see him for the crowd, was not because Christ was little of stature, and was hid among them, but because Zacchaeus was little of stature, and could not see over their heads. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/19.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/luke/19-3.htm" title="And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature....">Luke 19:3-4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τίς ἐστι</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> which among those who were passing by is Jesus. “<span class="ital">Fama</span> notum <span class="ital">vultu</span> noscere cupiebat,” Grotius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προδραμὼν ἔμπροσθεν</span>] Comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/11-2.htm" title="Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thou didst leave thy father:">Tob 11:2</a>; Plat. <span class="ital">Gorg</span>. p. 497 A; Xen. <span class="ital">Cyrop</span>. iv. 2. 23.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συκομορέαν</span>] The form <span class="greekheb">μορέα</span> occurs in Nicander as quoted by Athen.
