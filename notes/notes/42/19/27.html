Like the earlier portions of the outer framework of the story, it had an historical groundwork in the conduct of Archelaus on his return from Rome (Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars, ii.</span> 7, § 3). Spiritually, it represents, in bold figures drawn from the acts of tyrant kings, the ultimate victory of the Christ over the unbelieving and rebellious. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1Corinthians 15:25</a>.) They who will not have Him to reign over them will learn that He does reign, and having shut Love out, will themselves be shut out from Love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/luke/19-27.htm" title="But those my enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.">Luke 19:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">But those mine enemies, </span>&c. — Having thus inquired into the conduct of his servants, and treated them according to the different use they made of what had been intrusted with them, he then proceeded to pass sentence on his rebellious citizens, who had refused to have him for their king; and with a just resentment of their base ingratitude, he commanded them to be brought thither immediately, and slain in his presence, that others might learn a more dutiful submission by the execution of these rebels. The word <span class="greekheb">κατασφαξατε</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">slay them, </span>properly signifies, <span class="ital">slay them with the sword, </span>and seems first to refer to the dreadful slaughter of the impenitent Jews, by the sword of each other and of the Romans. But that does not seem to be the chief design of the passage; it more especially relates to the far more terrible execution which shall be done on all impenitent sinners in the great day, when the faithful servants of Christ shall be rewarded. Now all this was as if our Lord had said, Thus shall I at length appear, not as a temporal sovereign, but as the great eternal Judge and victorious Ruler over all; when, having received power and dominion from my Father, I shall bring all to their final account, and with infinite ease triumph over those who reject and affront my authority: take heed, therefore, that you be not found in their wretched number, as many will be who pretend most eagerly to desire the Messiah’s appearance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:11-27 This parable is like that of the talents, Mt 25. Those that are called to Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and from those to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe 4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of the talents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well as of false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that the pound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which is the same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less, seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men, by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I say ... - These are the words of the "nobleman" declaring the principles on which he would distribute the rewards of his kingdom.<p>But those mine enemies - By the punishment of those who would not that he should reign over them is denoted the ruin that was to come upon the Jewish nation for rejecting the Messiah, and also upon all sinners for not receiving him as their king.

The Messiah thus appears in a twofold relation: to His perverse people and to His servants. <span class="ital">The latter</span> are to be called to account at the <span class="ital">Parousia</span>, and according to the measure of the actual discharge of official duty committed equally to all, will be exalted to a proportionally high degree of participation in the Messianic dominion (comp. <a href="/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17</a>; <a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1 Corinthians 4:8</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2 Timothy 2:12</a>). This happiness, however, will be so far from falling to the lot of the indolent servant, who in any case is inexcusable,[234] that he was rather to be deprived of the official position of service which he had received, and consequently was to receive no kind of share in the future glory of the kingdom, to which, nevertheless, he also had been appointed.

Yet this feature is not inapposite, for there were likely to be three classes of people to be dealt with by the king: the honest and capable, the incapable and useless, and the disaffected. The chief objection to the part refening to the second class is that it gives the parable a too didactic aspect, aiming at theoretic exhaustiveness rather than insisting on the main points: how the king will deal with his friends and how with his foes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">mine enemies</span>] They had once been ‘citizens,’ <a href="/luke/19-14.htm" title="But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.">Luke 19:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">slay them before me</span>] Archelaus had similarly put some of his political opponents to death.
