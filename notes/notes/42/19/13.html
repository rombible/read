The <span class= "ital">pound,</span> or <span class= "ital">mna,</span> was, in Greek numismatics, not a coin, but a sum equal to the sixtieth part of a talent. The Greek name was probably derived from the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Maneh.</span> According to another estimate it was equal to 25 shekels, or 100 <span class= "ital">drachmœ?</span> or <span class= "ital">denarii.</span> The word meets us, as far as the New Testament is concerned, in this parable only.<p><span class= "bld">Occupy till I come.</span>—The better MSS. give, “while I am coming.” The Greek verb for “occupy” occurs in this passage only in the New Testament. A compound form of it is rendered, in <a href="/luke/19-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.">Luke 19:15</a>, by “gained in trading.” The English verb meets us in <a href="/ezekiel/27-9.htm" title="The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/27-16.htm" title="Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/27-21.htm" title="Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:21-22</a>, in the sense of “trading,” in which it is used here. (See also the Prayer Book version of <a href="/psalms/107-23.htm" title="They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;">Psalm 107:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/luke/19-13.htm" title="And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said to them, Occupy till I come.">Luke 19:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he called his ten servants </span>— This translation implies, he had neither more nor fewer than ten servants, and that they were all called: but Dr. Campbell thinks the original expression, <span class="greekheb">καλεσας δε δεκα δουλους εαυτου</span>, should rather be rendered, <span class="ital">having called ten of his servants, </span>and that if the sense had been as given in our translation, the expression must have been, <span class="greekheb">καλεσας δε τους δεκα δουλους εαυτου</span>. <span class="ital">And delivered them ten pounds </span>— Before he departed he gave each of these servants a sum of money, to be employed in trade, until he should return. The word <span class="greekheb">μνα</span>, or <span class="ital">mina, </span>as it is commonly called, here rendered <span class="ital">pound, </span>contained sixty shekels, (<a href="/ezekiel/45-12.htm" title="And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.">Ezekiel 45:12</a>,) and therefore, according to the common calculation of the worth of a shekel, placing it at two shillings sixpence of our money, it was seven pounds ten shillings; but according to Dr. Prideaux, who sets the shekel at three shillings, the <span class="ital">mina </span>was nine pounds sterling. Our Lord probably chose to mention this small sum, to illustrate the munificence of the master, in bestowing on the faithful servant so great and noble a reward. The impropriety of rendering the word <span class="ital">pound, </span>must strike every intelligent reader. The original word should have been retained, as it is in the parable of the talents, <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.">Matthew 25:14</a>, &c., to which parable this is very similar; and the notes on which the reader is desired to consult, for the more perfect elucidation of this. By the <span class="ital">ten servants, </span>(a certain number being put for an uncertain,) we are to understand; 1st, The apostles and first preachers of the gospel, to whom Jesus gave endowments fitting them for their work, and from whom he expected a due improvement of those endowments in the propagation of the gospel. 2d, Those whom he should call and qualify for the work of the ministry in future ages: and, 3d, All who did or should hereafter profess to receive his gospel, and to be his disciples and servants; conferring upon them the means of grace, encouragements and advantages for improvement in holiness, and gifts and abilities for usefulness to mankind. <span class="ital">And said unto them, Occupy till I come </span>— Till I return to take an account of the use you have made of what has been intrusted to your management. The spiritual sense is, Use your endowments, gifts, and graces, with all your privileges and advantages, for the good of your fellow-creatures, and the glory of God, till I come to visit the nation; to destroy Jerusalem; to execute judgment on my enemies, and on those of my people in successive ages; to require your souls of you by death, and to judge mankind in the day of final accounts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:11-27 This parable is like that of the talents, Mt 25. Those that are called to Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and from those to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe 4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of the talents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well as of false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that the pound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which is the same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less, seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men, by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ten servants - Nothing in particular is denoted by the number "ten." It is a circumstance intended to keep up the narrative. In general, by these servants our Saviour denotes his disciples, and intends to teach us that talents are given us to be improved, for which we must give an account at his return.<p>Ten pounds - The word translated "pound" here denotes the Hebrew "minah," which was equal to about 15 dollars, or 3 British pounds. The pounds here denote the talents which God has given to his servants on earth to improve, and for which they must give all account in the day of judgment.<p>Occupy till I come - The word "occupy" here means not merely to "possess," as it often does in our language, but to "improve," to employ "in business," for the purpose of increasing it or of making "profit" on it. The direction was to use this money so as to gain "more" against his return. So Jesus commands his disciples to "improve" their talents; to make the most of them; to increase their capability of doing good, and to do it "until" he comes to call us hence, by death, to meet him.

By whom are meant, not all mankind; for though these are all his servants of right, yet not in fact; nor the elect of God, who are called by grace; for though these are the servants of Christ, and are peculiarly his, yet all that received the pound were not such, for one of them was a wicked man; but the ministers of the Gospel, who are eminently, and in a special manner, the servants of the most high God: but as for the number "ten", this cannot regard the apostles, for they were twelve; and though they are sometimes called the eleven, after the apostasy and death of Judas, yet not the ten; and besides, there was another chose in his room; but this number being a large and perfect one, a round number, it is sometimes made use of as a certain number, for an uncertain one; see <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>. The call of these by their Lord, is not to be understood of the call of them by his grace, but of a call of them to the office and work of the ministry: <p>and delivered them ten pounds; every one a pound: the  "Maneh", or pound of the Hebrews, if of gold, which contained an hundred drachmas, was of the value of our money, "seventy five pounds"; if of silver, the old "Maneh", or pound, which contained sixty shekels, <a href="/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a> amounted to "seven pounds ten shillings"; but the "Maneh", or pound, mentioned in the Misna (k), and which was in use in our Lord's time, contained an hundred pence, and was of the value of our money, "three pounds two shillings and six pence": and by these pounds are designed, not special grace; for they intend not any thing wrought in these servants, but something delivered to them, and what might be taken away again, which cannot be said of special grace; and besides, it is certain, that one of these servants that had the pound, was destitute of that: but gifts are meant, and these not merely natural, or the gifts of providence, as health, riches, wisdom, &amp;c. nor only the outward means of grace, as the word and ordinances, but ministerial gifts, which are the greatest in the church, and are therefore signified by pounds; and are what may be improved or neglected, and be lost or taken away; and for which those that have them, are accountable: but though each of these servants are represented, as having every man a pound delivered to him, this must not be understood, as if the gifts of ministers were equal and alike, any more than the inequality of their rewards proves degrees in glory; for which sometimes this parable is produced: <p>and said unto him, occupy; negotiate, or trade, that is, with the pounds; make use of the ministerial gifts, exercise them, lay them out, and trade with them: the ministry is a trade and merchandise, to be carried on, not in the name of the ministers of Christ, nor on their own stock, nor for themselves, but for Christ, and for the good of souls; which shows, that they must not be slothful, but laborious and diligent: <p>till I:come: which suggests the certainty of Christ's coming, the continuance of the Gospel ministry to that time; and that there is no rest nor ease for Christ's ministers, but a continued series of labour and service, until then; when, for their encouragement, they shall receive their reward. <p>(k) Peah, c. 8. sect. 5. &amp; Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in ib. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</span><p>(5) There are three sorts of men in the Church: the one sort fall from Christ whom they do not see; the other, according to their God given position, bestow the gifts which they have received from God to his glory, with great pains and diligence; the third live idly and do no good.

But in Matthew, the Lord transfers to his servant his whole property; here he has only devoted a definite sum of money to the purpose of putting his servants to the proof therewith; and the smallness of the amount corresponds to what is so carefully emphasized in our parable, viz., the relation of faithfulness in the least to its great recompense (<a href="/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>); which relation is less regarded in the parable in Matthew" ("Commentary on Luke").<p>Occupy (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>The word occupy has lost the sense which it conveyed to the makers of the A.
