The parallelism between the shouts of the multitude before the Passion, and the song of the angels at the Nativity (<a href="/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>) is, in many ways, suggestive.

He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ's triumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, who are enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children.
