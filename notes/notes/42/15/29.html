The obedience had all along been servile, prompted by fear and hope, even as the slave’s obedience is. The language put into the mouth of the elder son is clearly meant to represent the habitual thoughts of the Pharisees. They are taken, as it were, after our Lord’s manner, as seen in the previous parables, at their own valuation of themselves. They are conscious of no transgressions; but in that very unconsciousness lies the secret of the absence of any sense of joy in being forgiven, of any power to sympathise with the joy of others, even of any satisfaction in the service in which they pride themselves. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/luke/7-47.htm" title="Why I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.">Luke 7:47-50</a>.) They are scandalised at the gladness which others feel when a penitent returns to God. It seems like an insult and wrong to themselves. Their life has been one of uniform obedience; they have performed their religious duties. Why is so much stir made about those who have fallen as they never fell?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/15-29.htm" title="And he answering said to his father, See, these many years do I serve you, neither transgressed I at any time your commandment: and yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:...">Luke 15:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">But he answering, said to his father </span>— The kindness and respect which his father showed him on this occasion, did not soften him in the least. He stubbornly persisted in his anger, and answered the affectionate speeches of his parent with nothing but loud and haughty accusations of his conduct. <span class="ital">These many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time </span>— This branch of the parable is finely contrived to express the high opinion which the Pharisees, here represented by the elder brother, entertained of their own righteousness and merit. <span class="ital">Yet thou never gavest me a kid, </span>&c. — Perhaps God does not usually give much consolation to those who never felt the deep sorrows of repentance. <span class="ital">But as soon as this thy son was come </span>— The ungracious youth disdained to call him his brother, and at the same time insolently insinuated, that his father seemed to despise all his other children, and to reckon this prodigal only his son; <span class="ital">which hath devoured thy living with harlots </span>— Hath wasted thy property in a long course of scandalous debaucheries, to his own ruin, and the infamy of the family. <span class="ital">Thou hast killed for him the fatted calf </span>— And made him as welcome as if he had been the most dutiful child upon earth. <span class="ital">And he said </span>— With great gentleness, when he might have taken offence at his son’s unbecoming reply, <span class="ital">Son, thou art ever with me </span>— And art every day receiving some token of my kindness. By calling him his son, after the insolent speech he had made, the father insinuated, that he acknowledged him likewise for his son, and that neither the undutifulness of the one, nor the frowardness of the other of his children, had extinguished his affection, or cancelled the relation subsisting between them. <span class="ital">All that I have is thine</span> — As thou hast formerly lived in my family, and hast had the command of my property, as far as thy exigencies required; so thou art at present heir to the bulk of my estate. This is a material intimation, and suggests a strong reason against murmuring at the indulgence shown to the greatest sinners. As the father’s receiving the youngest son did not cause him to disinherit the elder, so God’s receiving notorious sinners will be no loss to those who have always served him: neither will he raise these to a state of glory equal to that of those who have always served him, if they have, upon the whole, made a greater progress in inward as well as outward holiness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:25-32 In the latter part of this parable we have the character of the Pharisees, though not of them alone. It sets forth the kindness of the Lord, and the proud manner in which his gracious kindness is often received. The Jews, in general, showed the same spirit towards the converted Gentiles; and numbers in every age object to the gospel and its preachers, on the same ground. What must that temper be, which stirs up a man to despise and abhor those for whom the Saviour shed his precious blood, who are objects of the Father's choice, and temples of the Holy Ghost! This springs from pride, self-preference, and ignorance of a man's own heart. The mercy and grace of our God in Christ, shine almost as bright in his tender and gentle bearing with peevish saints, as his receiving prodigal sinners upon their repentance. It is the unspeakable happiness of all the children of God, who keep close to their Father's house, that they are, and shall be ever with him. Happy will it be for those who thankfully accept Christ's invitation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A kid - A young goat.

The respectable Jews, sunk in the complacency of formalism and letter-worshipping orthodoxy, had lost all conception that they were, at the best, but unprofitable servants. Like this elder son they “went about to establish their own righteousness” (<a href="/romans/9-14.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.">Romans 9:14</a>); and though they kept many formal commandments they ‘transgressed’ the love of God (<a href="/luke/11-42.htm" title="But woe to you, Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Luke 11:42</a>). Observe that while the younger son confesses with no excuse, the elder son boasts with no confession. This at once proves his hollowness, for the confessions of the holiest are ever the most bitter. The <span class="ital">antitheses</span> in the verse are striking, ‘You never <span class="ital">gave</span> me a <span class="ital">kid,</span> much less <span class="ital">sacrificed</span> a <span class="ital">fatted calf;</span>—not even for my <span class="ital">friends,</span> much less for <span class="ital">harlots</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou never gavest me a kid</span>] The reward of a life near his father’s presence, and in the safety of the old home, was nothing to him.

The same thought was in the mind, too, of him who thus prayed in the temple: "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are," etc. (<a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yet thou never gavest me a kid...

For this thy brother was dead.</span> The angry elder son will not even acknowledge the prodigal as <span class="accented">his</span> brother; with bitter scorn and some disrespect he speaks of him to his father as "thy son." The father throughout the scene is never incensed. He pleads rather than reproaches, and to this insolence he simply retorts, "Thy brother was dead to us, but now - <span class="cmt_word">It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad</span>." What was the end of this strange scene? The last words, breathing forgiveness and joy, leave a sweet sense of hope upon the reader that all would yet be well in that divided household, and that the brothers, friends again, would clasp hands before the loving father's eyes. But when Jesus told the parable to the crowds, the story was not yet played out. It depended on the Pharisees and rulers how the scene was to end. What happened at Jerusalem a <span class="accented">few weeks later</span>, when the Passion-drama was acted, and some <span class="accented">forty years later</span>, when the city was sacked, tells <span class="accented">us</span> something of what subsequently happened to the elder son of the Lord's parable. But the end has yet to come. We shall yet see the brothers, Jew and Gentile, clasp hands in loving friendship before the father, when the long-lost elder son comes home. There will be joy then indeed in the presence of the angels of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Kid (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Some read the diminutive, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, "a little kid."
