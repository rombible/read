This begins by his coming to himself. That is a turning point in the sinner's conversion. The Lord opens his eyes, and convinces him of sin; then he views himself and every object, in a different light from what he did before. Thus the convinced sinner perceives that the meanest servant of God is happier than he is. To look unto God as a Father, and our Father, will be of great use in our repentance and return to him. The prodigal arose, nor stopped till he reached his home. Thus the repenting sinner resolutely quits the bondage of Satan and his lusts, and returns to God by prayer, notwithstanding fears and discouragements. The Lord meets him with unexpected tokens of his forgiving love. Again; the reception of the humbled sinner is like that of the prodigal. He is clothed in the robe of the Redeemer's righteousness, made partaker of the Spirit of adoption, prepared by peace of conscience and gospel grace to walk in the ways of holiness, and feasted with Divine consolations. Principles of grace and holiness are wrought in him, to do, as well as to will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No more worthy ... - "Such has been my conduct that I have been a disgrace to my father.

Let me come again into your family, but I do not ask to be treated as a son. I am willing to come in if you will give me only the support that you give to a servant." This evinced,<p>1. Deep humility - such as a sinner should have.<p>2. Love for his father's house - such as all penitents should have toward God's dwelling-place in heaven.<p>3. Confidence in his father that he would treat him kindly, even if he treated him as a servant. Such confidence all returning penitents feel in God. They are assured that God will treat them kindly that whatever he gives them will be more than they deserve, and they are, therefore, willing to be in his hands. Yet,<p>4. He had no adequate sense of his father's kindness. He did not fully appreciate his character. He was far more kind than he had dared to hope he would be; just as all sinners undervalue the character of God, and find him always more kind than they had supposed. No sinner comes to God with a just and adequate view of his character, but "always" finds him more merciful than he had dared to hope. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. I will arise and go to my FATHER&#8212;The change has come at last, and what a change!&#8212;couched in terms of such exquisite simplicity and power as if expressly framed for all heart-broken penitents.<p>Father, &c.&#8212;Mark the term. Though "no more worthy to be called his son," the prodigal sinner is taught to claim the defiled, but still existing relationship, asking not to be made a servant, but remaining a son to be made "as a servant," willing to take the lowest place and do the meanest work. Ah! and is it come to this? Once it was, "Any place rather than home." Now, "Oh, that home! Could I but dare to hope that the door of it would not be closed against me, how gladly would I take any place and do any worK, happy only to be there at all." Well, that is conversion&#8212;nothing absolutely new, yet all new; old familiar things seen in a new light and for the first time as realities of overwhelming magnitude and power. How this is brought about the parable says not. (We have that abundantly elsewhere, Php 2:13, &c.). Its one object is to paint the welcome home of the greatest sinners, when (no matter for the present how) they "arise and go to their Father."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/15-18.htm" title="I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before you,">Luke 15:18</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And am no more worthy to be called thy son,....
