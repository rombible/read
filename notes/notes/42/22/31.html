The two-fold utterance of the name, as in the case of Martha (<a href="/luke/10-41.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things:">Luke 10:41</a>), is significant of the emphasis of sadness.<p><span class= "bld">Satan hath desired to have you.</span>—Both this verb, and the “I have prayed,” are in the Greek tense which indicates an act thought of as belonging entirely to the past. The Lord speaks as though He had taken part in some scene like that in the opening of Job (<a href="/context/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6-12</a>; <a href="/context/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.">Job 2:1-6</a>), or that which had come in vision before the prophet Zechariah (<a href="/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-5</a>), and had prevailed by His intercession against the Tempter and Accuser.<p><span class= "bld">That he may sift you as wheat.</span>—The word and the figure are peculiar to St. Luke’s record. The main idea is, however, the same as that of the winnowing fan in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>; the word for “sift” implying a like process working on a smaller scale. The word for “you” is plural. The fiery trial by which the wheat was to be separated from the chaff was to embrace the whole company of the disciples as a body. There is a latent encouragement in the very word chosen. They were “to be sifted as <span class= "ital">wheat.”</span> The good grain was there. They were not altogether as the chaff.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:...">Luke 22:31-34</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the Lord said, </span>&c. — To make his disciples humble and watchful, and kindly affectionate one to another, Christ assured them, that Satan was seeking to destroy them all by his temptations. As if he had said, <span class="ital">O Simon, Simon, behold Satan </span>— As in the case of Job; (<a href="/context/job/2-4.htm" title="And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has will he give for his life....">Job 2:4-5</a>;) <span class="ital">hath desired to have you </span>— My apostles, <span class="greekheb">εξητησατο υμας</span>, <span class="ital">hath required you, </span>or <span class="ital">sought you out; </span>or <span class="ital">requested permission, </span>as Dr. Campbell translates it; <span class="ital">to sift you as wheat </span>— To assault you by furious and violent temptations, or to try you to the uttermost. I must assure thee, therefore, that an hour of terrible trial is just at hand, which will press harder than thou art aware, on thee and all thy companions here. <span class="ital">But I </span>— Forseeing the danger to which thou, Peter, wilt be peculiarly exposed, I have graciously prevented thee with my watchful care; and <span class="ital">have prayed for thee — </span>For thou wilt be in the greatest danger of all my disciples; in order <span class="ital">that thy faith fail not </span>— Altogether. <span class="ital">And when thou art converted </span>— Renewed to repentance, or <span class="ital">hast returned </span>to thy duty, as <span class="greekheb">επιστρεψας </span>may be rendered; when thou art recovered from thy fall, and confirmed again in faith and holiness; <span class="ital">strengthen thy brethren </span>— All that are weak in faith, or shaken in mind by the approaching trial, and ready to relinquish the service they have undertaken. When thou art recovered by the grace of God, do what thou canst to recover others; when thy own faith is strengthened, labour to confirm the faith of others, and to establish them; when thou hast found mercy, encourage others to hope that they also shall find it. And do thine utmost, all the remainder of thy days, by word and deed, to engage all, over whom thou hast any influence, to a steady adherence to my cause in the midst of the greatest difficulties, and especially by setting them an example of eminent faith and fortitude. <span class="ital">And he said, Lord, I am ready to go with thee to prison and to death </span>— So Peter thought at this time: and such was his present intention and resolution; but he was not sufficiently acquainted with himself, nor aware of his own weakness. See on <a href="/context/matthew/26-33.htm" title="Peter answered and said to him, Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended....">Matthew 26:33-35</a>. <span class="ital">And he saith, I tell thee, Peter </span>— I most assuredly say unto thee; <span class="ital">the cock shall not crow this day </span>— Or rather, it shall not be the time of cock-crowing to-day, see on <a href="/mark/14-39.htm" title="And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words.">Mark 14:39</a>; <span class="ital">before thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me </span>— And shalt solemnly disclaim all regard to me.

In other words, notwithstanding thy pretended affection and fortitude, <span class="ital">a few </span>hours shall not pass till, in great consternation at the dangers with which I and my disciples shall be threatened, thou shalt basely deny, three several times, that thou art my disciple. Peter therefore had no reason to be elated, though on a former occasion he had confessed Jesus to be the Son of God. And his behaviour in this instance affords a very affecting example of human vanity, in the midst of the greatest weakness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:21-38 How unbecoming is the worldly ambition of being the greatest, to the character of a follower of Jesus, who took upon him the form of a servant, and humbled himself to the death of the cross! In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Simon - Peter. Jesus, foreseeing the danger of Peter, and knowing that he was about to deny him, took occasion to forewarn him and put him on his guard, and also to furnish him with a solace when he should be brought to repentance.<p>Satan hath desired - Satan is the prince of evil. One of his works is to try the faith of believers to place temptations and trials in their way, that they may be tested. Thus God gave Job into his hands, that it might be seen whether he would be found faithful, or would apostatize. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7-12</a>. So Satan desired to have Peter in his hands, that he might also try him.<p>May sift you as wheat - Grain was agitated or shaken in a kind of fan or sieve. The grain remained in the fan, and the chaff and dust were thrown off. So Christ says that Satan desired to try Peter; to place trials and temptations before him; "to agitate him" to see whether anything of faith would remain, or whether all would not be found to be chaff - mere natural ordor and false professions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31-34.

Our Lord directeth his speech to Peter, as one who (as it will by and by appear) had a greater confidence of himself than the rest expressed, and as one who he foresaw would fall more foully than the rest; though it appears, that in his speech he had a respect to them all, for the word <span class="ital">you</span> is in the plural number. The devil had a mind to disturb them all by his temptations (that is here called sifting). Christ hath his fan in his hand, and will sift his church, but his sifting is to purge his floor; he sifts a particular soul, to purify it from its lusts and corruptions; but Satan sifts the soul and the church merely to give them trouble, and to keep them from rest and quiet by continual motion and agitation. This we are all concerned to take notice of, that we may both be continually prepared for the time of our siftings, and bless God who doth not satisfy Satan’s desires to sift his; for he hath the same mind to winnow us now, that he had to sift Peter and the rest of the apostles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But</span> (saith our Saviour) <span class="bld">I have prayed that thy faith fail not.</span> There is a total and a partial failing of faith. Peter’s faith did fail in part; but the seed of God did yet abide in him, his faith did not wholly fail: so will it be with the faith of every true disciple of Christ. In hours of great temptation and trial, their faith may, as to some degrees, fail, but totally it shall not: they may be perverted, but they shall again be converted. As the apostles saith of the bodies of the saints, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>,11</span>, <span class="ital">And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you:</span> may also be said of their souls. They have in them a body of death, and they may in act hour of great temptations fail, and their gracious habits may seem to die. But if the Spirit of God dwelleth in the soul, he will again quicken their souls by his Spirit which dwelleth in them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren; </span> that is, when God hath recovered thee from thy fall, and made thee to see thy error, make an improvement of thy recovery out of the snare of the devil, by admonishing others to take heed of too much confidence in themselves, and encouraging them not to despair, though they also may fall into temptation; but that the grace of God shall be sufficient for them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon,.... Peter is particularly, and by name, spoken to, either because he might be a principal person in the debate and contention about superiority, mentioned in the context; or because he was chiefly to suffer in the following temptation of Satan; or because he was generally the mouth of the rest of the apostles; and he is addressed, not by the name of Peter, the name Christ gave him, when he first called him, signifying his future solidity, firmness, and steadfastness; because in this instance, he would not give any proof of it; but by his former name, Simon, and which is repeated, partly to show the earnestness of Christ in the delivery of what follows, and partly to express his affectionate concern for him; so the Jews observe (s) concerning God's calling, "Moses, Moses", <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> that  , "the doubling of the word", is expressive "of love", and finding grace and favour; even as it is said, "Abraham, Abraham",  <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a> or it may be to excite attention to what Christ was about to say. Though the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read the first of these, "to Simon", thus: Jesus said to Simon, <p>Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you; not only Peter, but all the apostles; for the word  "you", is plural: Satan, the enemy of the woman's seed, the accuser of the brethren, the wicked one, and the tempter, desired, asked leave of God, for he can do nothing without permission; that he might have these disciples under his power, and in his hand; just as he got leave to have the goods, and even the body of Job in his hand, and fain would have had his life, and soul too, could he have obtained it; and he would have the lives and souls of others; for he goes about, seeking to devour whom he may; and he had now an evil eye upon the apostles, and wanted an opportunity to gratify his malice and envy: his end in desiring to have them in his power was, <p>that he may sift you as wheat; not to separate the chaff from the wheat, but to make them look like all chaff, by covering the wheat of grace with the chaff of sin and corruption; or to destroy the wheat, was it possible; or to toss them to and fro as wheat is in a sieve; that is, to afflict and distress them; see <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a> by scattering them both from Christ, and one another; by filling them with doubts about Jesus being the Messiah and Redeemer: and by frightening them with the fears of enemies and of death, which end he obtained; see <a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>. <p>(s) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 38. 4.

The conversation with Peter concerning his denial is found in John also at the supper, while Matthew and Mark, on the other hand, place it on the way to Gethsemane. But how possible it is that the momentous word, which had already been spoken at the supper, was returned to again on the journey by night! so that in this way both narratives are correct in regard to the point of time. The words addressed to Peter in <a href="/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:">Luke 22:31</a> f. are peculiar to Luke, and are so characteristic in substance and in form, that they seem to be original, and not the offspring of tradition. The words <span class="greekheb">εἶπε δὲ ὁ κύριος</span> (which, nevertheless, are not found in B L T, Copt. Sahid., and are hence suspicious, and deleted by Tischendorf), if they are genuine, separate what follows from what precedes as a special opening of a discourse the occasion of which Luke does not state, and probably, moreover, could not, and hence the question at issue cannot be decided.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Σίμων</span>, <span class="greekheb">Σίμων</span>] <span class="ital">urgently</span> warning, as <a href="/luke/10-41.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things:">Luke 10:41</a>; <a href="/acts/11-4.htm" title="But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order to them, saying,">Acts 11:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐξῃτήσατο ὑμᾶς</span>] <span class="ital">he has demanded you</span> (thee and thy fellow-disciples) <span class="ital">for himself, longed for you into his power</span>, sibi tendendos postulavit; namely, <span class="ital">from God</span>, as he once did in the case of Job (Job 1.).

It is introduced more abruptly here than in any of the other accounts. The <span class="greekheb">εἶπε δὲ ὁ κύριος</span> of the T.R. is a natural attempt to mitigate the abruptness, but the passage is more effective without it.

But Jesus by preserving Peter, the ruin of whom would have carried with it the ruin of the rest, preserved them all. In fact this whole discourse of our Lord takes for granted, that Peter is the first of the apostles, by whose standing (maintenance of his ground as a believer), or else fall, the rest of them would either escape the risk, or else be the more endangered. But it was in respect of faith that he was the first, not in respect of authority and power. Whereas the pretended successor of Peter, after that he revolted from the pure simplicity of the faith, and yet claimed to himself alone the primacy in the faith and in authority, fell wholly and miserably into the ‘sieve’ [of Satan]. Those in the foremost van are generally followed by the rest of their fellow-soldiers: the foremost soldiers are imperilled more than the rest: the foremost need especially to be fortified with the care and prayers of themselves and of the ‘watchmen.’—<span class="greekheb">σινιάσαι</span>) <span class="greekheb">σίνιον</span>, <span class="ital">a sieve</span>.

But Satan’s sifting was for the sake of utterly destroying the faith of the apostles, whilst making them come into collision with one another, by means of raising agitations from without and from within, in things high and low alike.—<span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, <span class="ital">as</span>) with as much ease [as one would, wheat].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[236] The forcible repetition of the same word in the same sentence.

The majority of the more ancient authorities omit the words, "and the Lord said." These words were possibly inserted at an early date to obviate the abruptness of this sudden change in the subject-matter of the Lord's discourse. The more accurate translation would be, "Satan obtained you by asking that he," etc. Bengel comments with "<span class="accented">not</span> <span class="accented">content with Judas."</span> This saying of Jesus is a very mysterious one; it reveals to us something of what is going on in the unseen world. A similar request was made by the same bitter, powerful the in the case or Job (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>). Are we to understand that these are examples of what is constantly going on in that world so close to us, but from which no whisper ever reaches our mortal ears? Such grave thoughts lend especial intensity to those words in the prayer of prayers, where we ask "our Father which is in heaven" <span class="accented">to deliver us from evil</span>, or <span class="accented">the evil one</span>, as so many of our best scholars prefer to translate <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Satan asks that he may test and try the apostles. Judas he had already tempted, and he had won him. Possibly this signal victory emboldened him to proffer this request. We may imagine the evil one arguing thus before the Eternal: "These chosen ones who are appointed to work in the future so tremendous a work in thy Name, are utterly unworthy. Let me just try to lure them away with my lures. Lo, they will surely fall.
