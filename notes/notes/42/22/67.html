In his answer Jesus evidently refers to something which had preceded this interrogation on the part of the Sanhedrim He referred, no doubt, to that night examination before Caiaphas and certain chosen members of the council - the meeting passed over by St. Luke, but recounted by SS. Matthew and Mark. In this earlier trial, which we (see above) term the second, a similar question had been put to Jesus, but, as Lange and Stier point out, <span class="accented">now</span> the political significance of the charge, the claim to Messianic royalty, is brought into prominence. They were desirous to formulate an accusation which they could bring before the Roman tribunal of Pilate. The words, "Son <span class="accented">of God</span>," which the fury of jealous anger had wrung from Caiaphas (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>), is here left out of sight, and is only brought forward again by the fierce Jewish wrath excited by the Lord's quiet words telling of his "session at the right hand" (vers. 69, 70). <span class="accented">If I tell you, ye will not be-liege.</span> If you, who have seen my life, have heard my words, and seen my works, believe not, to what end is it to say it again now? </body></html>
