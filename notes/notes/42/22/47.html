Many instances there are, of Christ's being betrayed by those who, under the form of godliness, fight against the power of it. Jesus here gave an illustrious example of his own rule of doing good to those that hate us, as afterwards he did of praying for those that despitefully use us. Corrupt nature warps our conduct to extremes; we should seek for the Lord's direction before we act in difficult circumstances. Christ was willing to wait for his triumphs till his warfare was accomplished, and we must be so too. But the hour and the power of darkness were short, and such the triumphs of the wicked always will be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48-56</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 22:47-54.

To this it stands opposed that herein is found no disapproval of the blow with the sword, but only the prohibition to go any further; and, moreover, this not at all negatively expressed, as it would have most obviously occurred by means of some such expression as <span class="greekheb">μὴ ποῤῥωτέρω</span> or the like. Others take the words as an address to those who were <span class="ital">taking Him prisoner</span>, and thus <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span> either as <span class="ital">neuter</span> and <span class="ital">temporal:</span> “<span class="ital">missum facite me usque ad id tempus</span>, quo vulnus illius hominis sanavero” (Bornemann, so also Hammond, Kypke, de Wette, Lange, II. 3, p. 1461, III. p. 512), or <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span> as neuter, indeed, but <span class="ital">local:</span> let me go <span class="ital">thither</span> where the wounded man is (Paulus), or <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span> as <span class="ital">masculine:</span> let me go <span class="ital">to this man</span> in order to heal him (Stolz, Baumgarten-Crusius). Against these views the objection is that the context in the word <span class="greekheb">ἀποκριθείς</span> shows nothing else than a reply <span class="ital">to the disciples</span>, as Jesus does not turn to His enemies till <a href="/luke/22-52.htm" title="Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be you come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?">Luke 22:52</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἁψάμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] On account of <span class="greekheb">ἀφεῖλεν</span>, <a href="/luke/22-50.htm" title="And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.">Luke 22:50</a>, this is to be referred to the <span class="ital">place and the remains of the ear that had been cut off;</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἰάσατο αὐτόν</span> to the healing of the <span class="ital">wound</span> (not: replacing of the ear). With desperate arbitrariness Paulus says that He touched the wound in order to examine it, and told the man what he must do to heal it! Luke alone records the healing; and it can the less be cleared of the suspicion of being a legendary accretion (comp. Strauss, II. p. 461; Baumgarten-Crusius, Holtzmann, and others), like <a href="/context/luke/22-43.htm" title="And there appeared an angel to him from heaven, strengthening him....">Luke 22:43-44</a>, that even John, who narrates the blow with the sword so circumstantially, says nothing about it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/luke/22-52.htm" title="Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be you come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?">Luke 22:52</a>. <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τοὺς παραγενομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] These chief priests, etc., were therefore, according to Luke, associated with that <span class="greekheb">ὄχλος</span>, <a href="/luke/22-47.htm" title="And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.">Luke 22:47</a>.

For the terror which seized the multitude, the precipitate entrance of Judas into the garden, and our Lord’s first words to him, see <a href="/context/john/18-3.htm" title="Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and weapons....">John 18:3-9</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/22.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/22-47.htm" title="And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.">Luke 22:47</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προήρχετο αὐτοὺς</span>) Some read <span class="greekheb">προήρχετο αὐτῶν</span>. But the same phrase occurs in <a href="/mark/6-33.htm" title="And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and preceded them, and came together to him.">Mark 6:33</a>, <span class="greekheb">προῆλθον αὐτοὺς</span> <span class="ital">they outwent them</span>: by comparing this passage with the present, it is evident that the traitor reached our Lord more quickly than the band which accompanied him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 47-53.</span> - <span class="accented">The arrest of the Redeemer.</span> All the four evangelists tell the story of the last hours, in the main the same, though the language is often quite different, and fresh and important details appear in each memoir. The general effect on the thoughtful reader is that the Crucifixion and the events leading up to it were very far from being the result of the counsels of the Jewish leaders, the outcome of their relentless enmity. The death and all the attendant circumstances took place in their solemn order, then, when the public teaching of the Redeemer was finished, <span class="accented">because</span> it had been determined by some higher and grander power than was possessed by Jerusalem Sanhedrin or Roman Senate. So St. Matthew, in his account, twice (Matthew 26:54, 56) gives the ground for the arrest, "That the Scriptures might be fulfilled." And the Scriptures were but the echoes of that other and grander power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he yet spake, behold a multitude</span>. Different to his disciples, their Master, who had prayed and received as an answer to his prayer the angel's visit, was now, when the hour of mortal danger struck, in possession of the profoundest calm. No. thing disturbed his serenity any more. With calm majesty he advanced to meet the traitor as he guided his Master's deadly enemies into the garden. From this hour Jesus welcomes the cross, from which for a brief moment he had seemed to shrink. The corn-pony who was thus guided to Gethsemane to effect the arrest in the dead of the night was composed of Roman legionaries detailed for this duty from a cohort on guard in the Antonia Fort by the temple, and of Levitical guards belonging to the temple - an armed force of police, part of the temple watch at the disposal of the priests. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that was called Judas, one of the twelve.</span>  Each of the evangelists mention the presence of the traitor. It was evidently a strange and startling detail for the writers of these memoirs that one of the chosen twelve should have been the betrayer! And drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. This was the sign agreed upon between Judas and his employers. They knew that it would be night, and that Gethsemane was shaded with olives, and that therefore some conspicuous sign would be necessary to indicate to the guards which of the company of twelve was the Master whom they were to seize. But the signal was superfluous, for, as St. John tells us, Jesus of his own accord advanced before the others, telling those who came for him who he was. Because of this kiss the early Christian Church discontinued the customary brotherly kiss on Good Friday. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Multitude - one of the twelve<p>See on <a href="/matthew/26-47.htm">Matthew 26:47</a><p>To kiss<p>See on <a href="/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>. </body></html>
