And when they had blindfolded him, struck him on the face </span>— These circumstances are placed by Matthew and Mark after the council’s condemning him. Perhaps he was abused in the same manner both before and after his condemnation. Certainly “his judges and their retinue were abundantly capable of being thus unjust and barbarous toward him. Nevertheless, what Luke has said here, does not necessarily oblige us to suppose this. He might conclude his account of Peter’s denials with relating what followed upon our Lord’s being condemned, because it happened immediately after the last denial; and to show what a load of indignity was laid at once on the Son of God; namely, that while the most zealous of all his disciples was denying him with oaths and imprecations, the servants and others were insulting him in the most barbarous manner.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? </span>— “This usage of Christ,” says Dr. Hammond, “refers to that sport so ordinary among children, called <span class="greekheb">μυινδα</span>, in which it is the manner, first to blindfold, then to strike, (<a href="/luke/22-63.htm" title="And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.">Luke 22:63</a>,) then to ask who gave the blow, and not to let the person go till he had named the right man who had struck him. It was used on this occasion to reproach our blessed Lord, and to expose him to ridicule.” <span class="ital">Many other things spake they blasphemously against him </span>— The expression is remarkable.

He referred them to his second coming, for the full proof of his being the Christ, to their confusion, since they would not admit the proof of it to their conviction. He owns himself to be the Son of God, though he knew he should suffer for it. Upon this they ground his condemnation. Their eyes being blinded, they rush on.

Luke follows an entirely different tradition—different in respect of the time, the place, and the persons who were engaged in the mockery. The same characteristic ill-treatment (smiting—demand for prophecy), the original connection of which is in Matthew and Mark (in opposition to Schleiermacher), had arranged itself variously in tradition.

There both Annas and Caiaphas apparently lodged. In the first instance, Jesus was brought before Annas, who was evidently the leading personage of the Sanhedrin of that day. Details of the preliminary examination are given apparently by <a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13, 19-24</a>. In this first and informal trial Caiaphas was evidently present, and took part (ver. 19). At the close of this unofficial but important proceeding, Annas sent him to Caiaphas. The true reading in <a href="/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a> is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, "Annas therefore sent him." That is, at the close of the first <span class="accented">unofficial</span> examination, which took place in Annas's apartments in the palace of the high priest, Annas sent him to be examined <span class="accented">officially</span> before Caiaphas, the reigning high priest, and a committee of the Sanhedrim This, the second trial of Jesus, is related at some length by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-66</a>) and St. Mark (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55 64</a>). The priests on that occasion sought false witnesses, but their witness did not, we know, agree. Jesus kept silence until Caiaphas arose, and with  awful solemnity adjured him to say whether he was the Christ, the Son of God. So adjured, Jesus answered definitely in the affirmative. Then Caiaphas rent his robe, and appealed to the assembly, who answered the appeal by a unanimous cry," He is guilty of death." After this hearing before Caiapnas and a committee of the Sanhedrin, the condemned One was conducted before the full assembly of the Sanhedrim While being led across the court, he heard Peter's third denial. It was during the interval which elapsed before the great council assembled, that the mocking related in these verses (63-65) took place. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Smote (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Originally to flay; thence to cudgel.
