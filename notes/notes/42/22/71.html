He referred them to his second coming, for the full proof of his being the Christ, to their confusion, since they would not admit the proof of it to their conviction. He owns himself to be the Son of God, though he knew he should suffer for it. Upon this they ground his condemnation. Their eyes being blinded, they rush on.

Weiss (in Meyer, eighth edition) finds in this section clear evidence of the use of a Jewish-Christian source from the correspondence between the account it gives of the questions put to Jesus and His replies and the Jewish-Christian ideas regarding the Messiahship. These he conceives to have been as follows: In His earthly state Jesus was not Messiah or Son of Man; only a claimant to these honours. He became both in the state of exaltation (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a> : “God hath made Him both Lord and Christ”). He <span class="ital">was God’s Son</span> in the earthly state because He was conscious of God’s peculiar love and of a Messianic commission. So here: Jesus is <span class="ital">to become</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἔσται</span>) Messianic Son of Man with glory and power (<span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> and <span class="greekheb">δύναμις</span>); He is Son of God (<span class="greekheb">ἐγώ εἰμι</span>). On this view Sonship is lower than Christhood. Was that Lk.’s idea? On the contrary, he evidently treats the Christ question as one of subordinate importance on which it was hardly worth debating. The wider, larger question was that as to Sonship, which, once settled, settled also the narrower question. If Son, then Christ and more: not only the Jewish Messiah, but Saviour of the world. The account of the trial runs on the same lines as the genealogy, in which <span class="ital">Davidic</span> descent is dwarfed into insignificance by <span class="ital">Divine</span> descent (<span class="greekheb">υἱὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span>).</body></html>
