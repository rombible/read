Those who go upon Christ's word, need not fear disappointment. According to the orders given them, the disciples got all ready for the passover. Jesus bids this passover welcome. He desired it, though he knew his sufferings would follow, because it was in order to his Father's glory and man's redemption. He takes his leave of all passovers, signifying thereby his doing away all the ordinances of the ceremonial law, of which the passover was one of the earliest and chief. That type was laid aside, because now in the kingdom of God the substance was come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17-19</a> notes, and <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-16</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13. when ye are entered the city&#8212;He Himself probably stayed at Bethany during the day.<p>there shall a man, &c.&#8212;(See on [1720]Lu 19:29-32).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/22-3.htm" title="Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.">Luke 22:3</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they went,....
