Those who go upon Christ's word, need not fear disappointment. According to the orders given them, the disciples got all ready for the passover. Jesus bids this passover welcome. He desired it, though he knew his sufferings would follow, because it was in order to his Father's glory and man's redemption. He takes his leave of all passovers, signifying thereby his doing away all the ordinances of the ceremonial law, of which the passover was one of the earliest and chief.

Jesus takes the initiative; in Mt. and Mk. the disciples introduce the subject. Various reasons have been suggested for this change. Lk. simply states the fact as it was (Schanz). He thought it unsuitable that Jesus should seem to need reminding (Meyer, seventh edition). The change of day, from 14th to 13th Nisan, required Jesus to take the initiative (J. Weiss, Meyer, eighth edition).—<span class="greekheb">Πέτρον καὶ Ἰ</span>.: the two disciples sent out not named in parallels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">he sent Peter and John</span>] Apparently our Lord, now withdrawn from His active work, said nothing about the Passover till the disciples questioned Him as to His wishes. The old law that the Paschal Lamb must be chosen ten days beforehand had long fallen into desuetude. Its observance would have been impossible for the myriads of pilgrims who came from all parts of the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/22.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πέτρον καὶ Ἰωάννην</span>, <span class="ital">Peter and John</span>) Peter took precedency in point of dignity (‘amplitudine’); and yet John was, of the two, the more intimate with the Lord. [Whilst both of these were executing His commands, Jesus was still able, now that the traitor was put away from their company, the more to confirm the remaining nine in the faith.—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go and prepare us the Passover, that we may eat</span>. The three synoptists unite in describing this solemn meal, for which Peter and John were sent to prepare, as the ordinary Paschal Supper. But, on comparing the record of the same Supper given by St. John, we are irresistibly led to a different conclusion; for we read that on the following day those who led Jesus into the Praetorium went not in themselves, "lest they should be defiled; <span class="accented">but that they might eat the Passover"</span> (<a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>); and again it is said of the same day, that "it was the preparation of the Passover" (<a href="/john/19-14.htm">John 19:14</a>). So the time of the Supper is described by St. John (<a href="/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>) as "before the Feast of the Passover." It appears that our Lord was crucified on the 14th of Nisan, <span class="accented">on the very day of the sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb</span>, a few hours before the time of the Paschal Supper, and that his own Last Supper was eaten the night before, that is, twenty-four hours before the general time of eating the Passover Supper. The most venerable of the Fathers preserved this as a sacred tradition. So Justin Martyr: "On the day of the Passover ye took him, and om the day of the Passover ye crucified him"  ('Dial. cum Trypho,' ch. 3.). To the same effect write Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:23) and Tertullian ('Adv. Judaeos,' ch. 8). Clement of Alexandria is most definite: "The Lord did not cat his last Passover on the legal day of the Passover, but on the previous day, the 13th, and suffered on the day following, being himself the Passover" (Fragment from 'Chron. Paschal.,' p. 14, edit. Dindorf). Hippolytus of Portus bears similar testimony. The question - as to whether the famous Last Supper was the actual Passover Supper, or the anticipatory Paschal Feast, which we believe it to have been - is important; for thus the language of St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>), "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us," is justified. "The apostle regarded not the Last Supper, but the death of Christ, as the antitype of the Paschal sacrifice, and the correspondence of type and antitype would be incomplete unless the sacrifice of the Redeemer took place at the time on which alone that of the Paschal lamb could legally be offered" (Dean Mansel). </body></html>
