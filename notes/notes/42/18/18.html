Many who are loth to leave Christ, yet do leave him. After a long struggle between their convictions and their corruptions, their corruptions carry the day. They are very sorry that they cannot serve both; but if one must be quitted, it shall be their God, not their wordly gain. Their boasted obedience will be found mere outside show; the love of the world in some form or other lies at the root. Men are apt to speak too much of what they have left and lost, of what they have done and suffered for Christ, as Peter did.

(3) Unlike the "rulers," to whose class he belonged (Lu 18:18), he so far believed in Jesus as to be persuaded He could authoritatively direct him on this vital point.

The history is of great use to us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To show how far a man may go, that yet is a great way short of a truly good and spiritual state. He may know that nothing in this life will make him perfectly happy. He may desire eternal life, and salvation. He may go a great way in keeping the commandments of God, as to the letter of them. He may come to the ministers of the gospel to be further instructed. But herein he will fail, he will not come to Christ that he may have life, but fancy he should do something meritorious of it; he doth not aright understand the law, and that there is no going to heaven that way, but by the perfect observation of it, and therefore fancies himself in a much better state than he is. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It instructs us in this, that there is no coming to heaven by works, but by a full and perfect obedience to the whole revealed will of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That every hypocrite hath some lust or other, in which he cannot deny himself. This ruler’s lust was his immoderate love of the world, and the things thereof. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That it is a mighty difficult thing for any persons, but especially such as have great possessions on earth, to get to heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. As difficult and almost impossible as it may appear to men, yet nothing is impossible with God. He can change the heart of the rich, and incline it to himself; as well as the, heart of the poor. The rich man hath more impediments; but be men rich or poor, without the powerful influence of God upon the heart, without his free grace, no soul will be saved. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And a certain ruler asked him,....

The Marcionite reading: <span class="greekheb">ὁ γὰρ ἀγαθὸς εἷς ἐστὶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεὸς ὁ πατήρ</span>, is nothing but an old gloss (in opposition to Volkmar, Hilgenfeld), not more Marcionite than the reading of the text, and this latter is no anti-Marcionite alteration.

The touch added by St Mark (<a href="/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17</a>), that he suddenly ran up and fell on his knees before Him, seems to imply that he was eager to catch the opportunity of speaking to Jesus before He started on a journey, probably the journey from the Peraean Bethany, beyond Jordan (<a href="/context/john/10-41.htm" title="And many resorted to him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true....">John 10:41-42</a>), to the Bethany near Jerusalem, to raise Lazarus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Good Master</span>] This title was an impropriety, almost an impertinence; for the title ‘good’ was never addressed to Rabbis by their pupils.

St. Matthew speaks of him as the young man. St. Luke here styles him a ruler; by some the title is supposed simply to denote that he was the ruler of a synagogue or congregation; others, however, consider that it denotes that the subject of the narrative was a ruler of the Jews, and possibly, but this is of course doubtful, a member of the Sanhedrin. His youth (<a href="/matthew/19-20.htm">Matthew 19:20</a>) is not at variance with this inference. Youth is defined by Philo as including the period between twenty-one and twenty-eight. All the three evangelists mention his great wealth. Dean Plumptre suggests that his large possessions and evident devotion had probably opened to him, at a comparatively early age, a place in the great council. His question concerning eternal life indicates that he was a Pharisee, and he evidently represented the noblest phase of this religious party. He had sedulously followed out the precepts of the best rabbinic schools of his day, but there was something lacking, he felt, and his intercourse with Jesus and the influence of the Master's words led him to take this question point-blank to the famous Teacher, who he felt - alone of any master whom he had met - was able to satisfy this longing desire of his heart. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ruler<p>Peculiar to Luke. </body></html>
