It meets us in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>, and is there rendered “I k<span class= "ital">eep under</span> my body.” Literally, however, it expresses the act of the pugilist when he strikes a blow which leaves a livid bruise on his opponent’s face, and it would seem to have been transferred, in the natural transition of popular metaphor into the forms of colloquial language, from the arena to common life. So we talk of men “hitting hard” or “giving a knock-down blow” in controversy or debate. What is described here is the continuous shower of blows, each of which is short of a “knock-down,” while their accumulative effect is, in the nearest equivalent of modern English, that the man is so “punished” that he is glad to give over at any price.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 All God's people are praying people. Here earnest steadiness in prayer for spiritual mercies is taught. The widow's earnestness prevailed even with the unjust judge: she might fear lest it should set him more against her; but our earnest prayer is pleasing to our God. Even to the end there will still be ground for the same complaint of weakness of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For a while - Probably this means for a "considerable" time. It was his duty to attend to the claims of justice, but this was long delayed.<p>Within himself - He thought, or came to a conclusion.<p>Though I fear not ... - This contains the reason why he attended to the case at all. It was not from any regard to justice, or to the duties of his office. It was simply to avoid "trouble." And yet his conduct in this case might have appeared very upright, and possibly might have been strictly according to law and to justice. How many actions are performed that "appear well," when the doers of those actions know that they are mere hypocrisy! and how many actions are performed from the basest and lowest motives of "selfishness," that have the appearance of external propriety and even of goodness!<p>She weary me - The word used here, in the original, is that which was employed to denote the wounds and bruises caused by "boxers," who beat each other, and blacken their eyes, and disable them. See the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>. Hence, it means any vexatious and troublesome importunity that takes the time, and disables from other employment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. continual coming&#8212;coming for ever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/18-2.htm" title="Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:">Luke 18:2</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet because this widow troubleth me,....

The character of this judge, his reasoning with himself upon it, his principles from which he acted, and the ends he had in view, are wholly to be left out in the accommodation of this parable; and no farther to be considered than as the argument from the lesser to the greater may be strengthened by them; the intention of the parable being only to show the force, efficacy, and usefulness of importunity in prayer, as appears by the application of it, by our Lord, in the verses following. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> weary me.</span><p>(c) Literally, beat me down with her blows, and it is a metaphor taken of wrestlers who beat their adversaries with their fists or clubs: in the same way those that are persistent beat the judge's ears with their crying out, even as it were with blows.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/18.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/18-5.htm" title="Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.">Luke 18:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">διά γε</span>, etc.: similar expression in <a href="/luke/11-8.htm" title="I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.">Luke 11:8</a>. The parable before us is a companion to that of the <span class="ital">Selfish Neighbour</span>. The two should be studied together—<span class="ital">vide The Parabolic Teaching of Christ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">κόπον</span>: the power of the petitioner in both parables lies in their ability and determination to disturb the comfort of those they address. The neighbour and the judge are both selfish, care only for their own ease, and it is that very quality that gives the suppliants their opportunity. They can annoy the reluctant into granting their requests—success certain.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τέλος</span>: interpreters differ as to the meaning of this phrase, and whether it should be connected with <span class="greekheb">ἐρχομένη</span> or with <span class="greekheb">ὑπωπιάζῃ</span>. The two ways of rendering the last clause of <a href="/luke/18-5.htm" title="Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.">Luke 18:5</a> are: lest coming <span class="ital">continually</span>, she weary me to death, or lest coming and coming, she <span class="ital">at last</span> give me black eyes; of course meant in a humorous sense. The latter rendering does more justice to the humour of the situation, but the other seems more in harmony with the scope of the parable, which is to enforce <span class="ital">persistence</span> in prayer—continual coming. The present tense in participle and verb also seems to demand the first rendering: it points to a process in the coming and in its effect on the judge, the two keeping pace with each other. As she keeps coming, he gets more and more bored. If a final act, the use of fists (seriously or humorously meant) were pointed at by <span class="greekheb">ὑπωπ</span>., the aorist would have been more suitable. (So Field in <span class="ital">Ot. Nor.</span>) The philological commentators differ in regard to the sense of <span class="greekheb">εἰς τέλος</span>, some taking it = <span class="ital">perpetuo, indesinenter</span> (Grotius, Kypke); others = <span class="ital">tandem</span> (Palairet); others = <span class="ital">omnino</span> (Raphel); all citing examples.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">troubleth me</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">gives me trouble.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lest by her continual coming</span>] Literally, “<span class="ital">coming to the end,”</span> “<span class="ital">coming for ever</span>”—another colloquialism.<span class="ital"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>she weary me</span>] The original has the curious word <span class="ital">hupopiaze; </span>literally, “<span class="ital">should blacken me under the eyes.”</span> Some have supposed that he is afraid lest the widow should be driven by desperation to make an assault on him <span class="ital">(ne sugillet me,</span> Vulg.; ne <span class="ital">obtundat</span> me, Beza<span class="ital">); </span>but undoubtedly the word is a colloquialism (Ar. <span class="ital">Pax,</span> 519) retained in Hellenistic Greek, and found also in St Paul in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, where it is rendered, “I <span class="ital">keep tinder</span> my body.” It is like the English colloquialism “to <span class="ital">plague</span> a person.” Comp. <a href="/matthew/15-23.htm" title="But he answered her not a word.

That word is from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the part of the face under the eyes, and means to strike under the eye; to give one a black eye. It is used only once again, by Paul, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, and in its literal sense: "I buffet my body;" treat it as the boxer does his adversary. The more literal sense of this word, and of &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, in the end, or finally, give a sound and much livelier meaning here. "Lest at last she come and assault me." So Goebel and Meyer, and so Wyc., "Lest at the last she, coming, strangle me;" and Tynd., "Lest at the last she come and rail on me." The judge fears lest importunity may culminate in personal violence. Perhaps, also, as Goebel suggests, he intentionally exaggerates his fear. </body></html>
