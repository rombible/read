It is the mind of Christ, that little children should be brought to him. The promise is to us, and to our seed; therefore He will bid them welcome to him with us. And we must receive his kingdom as children, not by purchase, and must call it our Father's gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. But Jesus&#8212;"much displeased," says Mark (Mr 10:14); and invaluable addition.<p>said&#8212;"Suffer the little children to come unto Me"&#8212;"AND FORBID THEM NOT," is the important addition of Matthew (Mt 19:14) and Mark (Mr 10:14). What words are these from the lips of Christ! The price of them is above rubies. But the reason assigned, "For of such is the Kingdom of God," or "of heaven," as in Mt 19:14, completes the previous information here conveyed; especially as interpreted by what immediately follows: "And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them" (Mr 10:16). It is surely not to be conceived that all our Lord meant was to inform us, that seeing grown people must become childlike in order to be capable of the Kingdom of God, therefore they should not hinder infants from coming to Him, and therefore He took up and blessed the infants themselves. Was it not just the grave mistake of the disciples that infants should not be brought to Christ, because only grown people could profit by Him, which "much displeased" our Lord? And though He took the irresistible opportunity of lowering their pride of reason, by informing them that, in order to enter the Kingdom, "instead of the children first becoming like them, they must themselves become like the children" [Richter in Stier], this was but by the way; and, returning to the children themselves, He took them up in His gracious arms, put His hands upon them and blessed them, for no conceivable reason but to show that they were thereby made capable, AS INFANTS, of the Kingdom of God. And if so, then "Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?" (Ac 10:47). But such application of the baptismal water can have no warrant here, save where the infants have been previously brought to Christ Himself for His benediction, and only as the sign and seal of that benediction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/18-15.htm" title="And they brought to him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.">Luke 18:15</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Verily I say unto you,...., Christ takes an occasion from hence to teach his disciples humility, and guard them against pride and vanity: <p>whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God; the King Messiah, the doctrines of the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, even the whole Gospel dispensation; <p>as a little child; without prejudice, pride, ambition, and vanity, with meekness, and humility: <p>shall in no wise enter therein; a very unfit and improper person to be a professor of the Gospel; or to be admitted to Gospel ordinances: or be a member of a Gospel church; or be reckoned a subject of the Messiah's kingdom, which is of a spiritual nature; and as he has not a meetness for, and a right unto the kingdom of glory, he shall never see it, and enjoy it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</span><p>(6) Childlike innocence is an ornament of Christians.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/18.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/18-17.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.">Luke 18:17</a>, as in <a href="/mark/10-15.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.">Mark 10:15</a>.
