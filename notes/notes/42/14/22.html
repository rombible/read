All found some pretence to put off their attendance. This reproves the Jewish nation for their neglect of the offers of Christ's grace. It shows also the backwardness there is to close with the gospel call. The want of gratitude in those who slight gospel offers, and the contempt put upon the God of heaven thereby, justly provoke him. The apostles were to turn to the Gentiles, when the Jews refused the offer; and with them the church was filled. The provision made for precious souls in the gospel of Christ, has not been made in vain; for if some reject, others will thankfully accept the offer. The very poor and low in the world, shall be as welcome to Christ as the rich and great; and many times the gospel has the greatest success among those that labour under worldly disadvantages and bodily infirmities. Christ's house shall at last be filled; it will be so when the number of the elect is completed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet there is room - He went out and invited all he found in the lanes, and yet the table was not full. This he also reported to his master. "There is room!" What a glorious declaration is this in regard to the gospel! There yet is room. Millions have been saved, but there yet is room. Millions have been invited, and have come, and have gone to heaven, but heaven is not yet full. There is a banquet there which no number can exhaust; there are fountains which no number can drink dry; there are harps there which other hands may strike; and there are seats there which others may occupy. Heaven is not full, and there yet is room. The Sunday school teacher may say to his class, there yet is room; the parent may say to his children, there yet is room; the minister of the gospel may go and say to the wide world, there yet is room. The mercy of God is not exhausted; the blood of the atonement has not lost its efficacy; heaven is not full. What a sad message it "would" be if we were compelled to go and say, "There is no more room - heaven is full - not another one can be saved. No matter what their prayers, or tears, or sighs, they cannot be saved. Every place is filled; every seat is occupied." But, thanks be to God, this is not the message which we are to bear; and if there yet is room, come, sinners, young and old, and enter into heaven. Fill up that room, that heaven may be full of the happy and the blessed. If any part of the universe is to be vacant, O let it be the dark world of woe! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. yet there is room&#8212;implying that these classes had embraced the invitation (Mt 21:32; Mr 12:37, last clause; Joh 7:48, 49); and beautifully expressing the longing that should fill the hearts of ministers to see their Master's table filled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/14-16.htm" title="Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:">Luke 14:16</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the servant said,....
