The occasion of the question was the object before him, whom Christ had a compassionate regard to, and determined to cure; but knowing that these men were catching at every thing, to traduce him, was desirous of having their sentiments first; not but that he knew full well, what was agreeable to the law of God, and what was not; and what also were the traditions of their elders, which they held, and which allowed of healing on the sabbath day, where life was in danger. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/14-3.htm" title="And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?">Luke 14:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀποκριθεὶς</span>: Jesus addresses Himself to the double situation; on the one hand a sick man dumbly appealing for help, on the other jealous religionists aware of His free habit and expecting eccentric speech and action open to censure.—<span class="greekheb">ἔξεστιν</span>, etc.: first He asks a question as to the legality of Sabbatic healing in a tone which amounts to an affirmative assertion, allowed to pass uncontradicted (<span class="greekheb">ἡσύχασαν</span>); then He proceeds to answer His own question by healing the man (<a href="/luke/14-4.htm" title="And they held their peace.
