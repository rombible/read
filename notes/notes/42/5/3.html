Time spent on week days in public exercises of religion, need be but little hinderance in time, and may be great furtherance to us in temper of mind, as to our worldly business. With what cheerfulness may we go about the duties of our calling, when we have been with God, and thus have our worldly employments sanctified to us by the word and prayer! Though they had taken nothing, yet Christ told them to let down their nets again. We must not abruptly quit our callings because we have not the success in them we desire. We are likely to speed well, when we follow the guidance of Christ's word. The draught of fishes was by a miracle. We must all, like Peter, own ourselves to be sinful men, therefore Jesus Christ might justly depart from us. But we must beseech him that he would not depart; for woe unto us if the Saviour depart from sinners! Rather let us entreat him to come and dwell in our hearts by faith, that he may transform and cleanse them. These fishermen forsook all, and followed Jesus, when their calling prospered. When riches increase, and we are tempted to set our hearts upon them, then to quit them for Christ is thankworthy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which was Simon's - Simon Peter's.<p>Prayed him - Asked him.<p>He sat down - This was the common posture of Jewish teachers. They seldom or never spoke to the people "standing." Compare <a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>. It may be somewhat difficult to conceive why Jesus should go into a boat and put off from the shore in order to speak to the multitude; but it is probable that this was a small bay or cove, and that when he was "in" the boat, the people on the shore stood round him in the form of an amphitheater. It is not improbable that the lake was still; that scarcely a breeze passed over it; that all was silence on the shore, and that there was nothing to disturb his voice. In such a situation he could be heard by multitudes; and no spectacle could be more sublime than that of the Son of God - the Redeemer of the world - thus speaking from the bosom of a placid lake - the emblem of the peaceful influence of his own doctrines - to the poor, the ignorant, and the attentive multitudes assembled on the shore. Oh how much "more" effect may we suppose the gospel would have in such circumstances, than when proclaimed among the proud, the joyful, the honored, even when assembled in the most splendid edifice that wealth and art could finish! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. taught &#8230; out of the ship&#8212;(See on [1571]Mt 13:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 3-11. Here is a plain and orderly story, related with many circumstances, tending to show us the power and influence of God upon men’s successes, in their honest and ordinary callings, and also that God hath a command upon the fish in the sea; together with an account of Christ’s call of Simon Peter to be a preacher of the gospel. The only difficulty is to reconcile this to what Matthew tells us, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18</a>,19</span>, &c. Matthew’s words are these: <span class="ital">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. And they immediately left the ship, and their father, and followed him.</span> Mark’s relation doth much agree with Matthew’s. The differences are in these things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Matthew and Mark speak of Christ’s calling these disciples as he was walking by the sea. Luke seems to mention it as done in the ship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer:</span> Luke doth not say that Christ spake so to Simon in the ship, though he doth indeed mention those words to Simon, before he mentions their bringing the ship to land, because possibly he would give account of all that Christ did or spake together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. a) They might be out of the ship, walking by the sea, before he called James and John, whose call Luke doth not mention, but Matthew and Mark alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) Matthew and Mark mention no ships, nor going of Christ into any, nor any draught of fishes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer:</span> Matthew saith that he saw Simon and Andrew casting their nets into the sea. But there is nothing more ordinary than for one evangelist to relate more fully what another repeateth summarily. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Matthew and Mark speak of Andrew being with Simon; Luke mentions Simon alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer:</span> Luke denies not that Andrew was there, and we are sure Simon alone could not manage the nets with such a draught of fishes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Matthew and Mark speak of the calling of Simon, Andrew, James, and John; Luke only of the calling of Simon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer:</span> It doth not follow from thence that they were not called during Christ’s walk by the sea after he came out of the ship: Matthew and Mark assure us they were. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. Matthew and Mark say that James and John were mending their nets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer:</span> Luke saith nothing to the contrary, for he doth not mention their call at that instant when Simon was. That immediately after such a draught of fishes their nets should want mending, and they be so employed, is nothing at all strange. So as it was like there was a little distance of time between the call of Peter and the others; yet Luke, omitting some circumstances mentioned by Matthew and Mark, as well as adding much to this history by them omitted, saith (at least) of more than one, <span class="ital">they forsook all, and followed him.</span> Hence appeareth that there may be a coherent history, taking in what all three evangelists say, only allowing that Christ came upon the shore, and walked by the sea side some short time, before he called James and John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The history instructs us: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. How good a thing it is for men to be employed in their honest callings, though never so mean. There God meets people with blessings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. How much it is our duty to yield obedience to God’s commands, and how advantageous it will prove, how contrary soever they appear to our sense and reason. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Upon whom our blessing depends, let our labour be what it will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That it is the work of the ministers of the gospel to catch men, to gain souls to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. How powerful God’s calls are: <span class="ital">They forsook all, and followed him</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the difference between what John saith, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>,41</span>, of the call of Andrew and Simon, from what the other three evangelists say, we have spoken something in our notes: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18</a>"</span>, and shall add more when we come to that place in John. In short, John speaketh of another time, before that either of them were called to follow Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's,....
