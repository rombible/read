It is to them as a tale that is told them, not as a message that is sent to them. Observe the duties taught and recommended to us by the history of the paralytic. In applying to Christ, we must be very pressing and urgent; that is an evidence of faith, and is very pleasing to Christ, and prevailing with him. Give us, Lord, the same kind of faith with respect to thy ability and willingness to heal our souls. Give us to desire the pardon of sin more than any earthly blessing, or life itself. Enable us to believe thy power to forgive sins; then will our souls cheerfully arise and go where thou pleasest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tiling - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. housetop&#8212;the flat roof.<p>through the tiling &#8230; before Jesus&#8212;(See on [1575]Mr 2:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,">Luke 5:1</a>8"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason,.... To think and say within themselves, and it may be to one another, in a private manner: <p>saying, who is this which speaketh blasphemies? what vain boaster, and blaspheming creature is this, who assumes that to himself, which is the prerogative of God? <p>Who can forgive sins but God alone? against whom they are committed, whose law is transgressed, and his will disobeyed, and his justice injured and affronted. Certain it is, that none can forgive sins but God; not any of the angels in heaven, or men on earth; not holy good men, nor ministers of the Gospel; and if Christ had been a mere man, though ever so good a man, even a sinless one, or ever so great a prophet, he could not have forgiven sin; but he is truly and properly God, as his being a discerner of the thoughts of these men, and his healing the paralytic man in the manner he did, are sufficient proofs. The Scribes and Pharisees therefore, though they rightly ascribe forgiveness of sin to God alone, yet grievously sinned, in imputing blasphemy to Christ: they had wrong notions of Christ, concluding him to be but a mere man, against the light and evidence of his works and miracles; and also of his office as a Redeemer, who came to save his people from their sins; and seem to restrain the power of forgiving sin to God the Father, whereas the Son of God, being equal with him, had the same power, and that even on earth, to forgive sin; See Gill on <a href="/mark/2-7.htm">Mark 2:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies?
