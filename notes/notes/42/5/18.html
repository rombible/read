It is to them as a tale that is told them, not as a message that is sent to them. Observe the duties taught and recommended to us by the history of the paralytic. In applying to Christ, we must be very pressing and urgent; that is an evidence of faith, and is very pleasing to Christ, and prevailing with him. Give us, Lord, the same kind of faith with respect to thy ability and willingness to heal our souls. Give us to desire the pardon of sin more than any earthly blessing, or life itself.

Both those evangelists record the same story with very small alterations in the phrase, nothing in the sense. Instead of the last words, <span class="ital">We have seen strange things today</span>, Matthew saith, <span class="ital">they glorified God, who had given such power unto men</span>. By which appeareth that all the effect this miracle had was, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Amazement. A thing was done; they understood not how it could be effected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. They apprehended a Divine power as to the effect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They therefore <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">glorified God, who had given such power unto men.</span> So as it is plain they only looked upon Christ as a great Prophet, to whom God had communicated such a Divine power, as of old he had communicated to Elijah, and then to Elisha. Lest any should stumble at what is said, that they uncovered the house, and let him down through the tiling, fancying the roofs of their houses built as ours, they must know, that the most of their houses were built (like some amongst us) with flat roofs, which were covered with some slates or stones, so as they might easily be uncovered; and this appeareth by the command of God, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/22-8.htm" title="When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you bring not blood on your house, if any man fall from there.">Deu 22:8</a></span>, concerning making battlements on the tops of their houses, to prevent casualties. The object of the faith here mentioned, was plainly the Divine power and goodness, but not as coming from Christ originally, as eternal God, but as an instrument by which God conveyed it to men under such miserable circumstances as this poor man was. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy,....

These healings must have been of common occurrence with our Lord. The poor sufferer and his friends, intensely anxious for an interview with One whom they justly regarded as the great Physician, were rightly confident that they had but to see the Master, to state their case, and to receive the blessing which they sought. On this occasion it seemed impossible to get at the merciful Healer. Now or never, they thought. He might, as he had done before, withdraw himself. The chance might never recur. So they accomplished their purpose in the way narrated by the evangelist. It was evidently nothing very extraordinary - an ingenious device, nothing more; only by it the friends of the sufferer showed that they were intensely in earnest, that they were confident that the Master had both the power and the will to do what they wanted, Much has been written on the device employed on this occasion by the friends of the paralytic. Delitzsch, in his 'A Day at Capernaum,' graphically describes what must have taken place. Two bearers ascend the roof by a ladder, and by means of cords they draw up by the same way the sick man after them, assisted by two other bearers. In the middle of the terrace was a square place, open in summer to give light and air to the house, but closed with tiles during the rainy season. Having opened this passage, the bearers let down the sick man into the large inner court immediately below, where Jesus was teaching, near the cistern fixed as usual in this court. The trap-stairs, which led down from the terrace into the court, would have been too narrow for their use, and would not have taken them into the court, but into the apartments which overlooked it from all sides. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Taken with a palsy (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., more neatly, palsied.
