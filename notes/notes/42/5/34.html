It was a wonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction of sinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of his grace, that he fixed the services of his disciples according to their strength and standing.

Fasting.<p>(See on [1577]Mt 9:14-17.)<p>The incongruities mentioned in Lu 5:36-38 were intended to illustrate the difference between the genius of the old and new economies, and the danger of mixing up the one with the other. As in the one case supposed, "the rent is made worse," and in the other, "the new wine is spilled," so by a mongrel mixture of the ascetic ritualism of the old with the spiritual freedom of the new economy, both are disfigured and destroyed. The additional parable in Lu 5:39, which is peculiar to Luke, has been variously interpreted. But the "new wine" seems plainly to be the evangelical freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be expected "straightway"&#8212;all at once&#8212;to take a liking for the former; that is, "These inquiries about the difference between My disciples and the Pharisees," and even John's, are not surprising; they are the effect of a natural revulsion against sudden change, which time will cure; the new wine will itself in time become old, and so acquire all the added charms of antiquity. What lessons does this teach, on the one hand, to those who unreasonably cling to what is getting antiquated; and, on the other, to hasty reformers who have no patience with the timidity of their weaker brethren!   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/5-33.htm" title="And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but your eat and drink?">Luke 5:33</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them,....

But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span> On this reply of the Lord Jesus Godet very beautifully writes. "In the midst of this feast of publicans, the heart of Jesus is overflowing with joy; it is one of the hours when his earthly life seems to his feeling like a marriage-day. But suddenly his countenance becomes overcast: the shadow of a painful vision passes across his brow: 'The days will come,'...  said he, in a solemn tone. At the close of this nuptial week, the Bridegroom himself will be suddenly smitten and cut off; then will come the time of fasting for those who to-day are rejoicing; there will be no necessity to enjoin it. In this striking and poetic answer Jesus evidently announces his violent death." The imagery of the bridegroom is drawn from <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>, and perhaps also from the more mystical Scripture, <a href="/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>. and the Song of Songs. Jesus here clearly regards himself as the Christ, as identical with the long looked-for Divine Deliverer; but at this comparatively early stage of his public career he was fully conscious that in his Person, with the triumphant would be joined the suffering Messiah. The word rendered "shall be taken away from (them)," <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;</span>, only occurs here in the New Testament; it points evidently to a death of violence. While the intimation given to Nicodemus (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>) was the first <span class="accented">private</span>, so this seems to have been the first <span class="accented">public</span> announcement of the last scene of the earth-life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Children of the bride-chamber<p>Better, as Rev., sons (&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;).
