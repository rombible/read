Time spent on week days in public exercises of religion, need be but little hinderance in time, and may be great furtherance to us in temper of mind, as to our worldly business. With what cheerfulness may we go about the duties of our calling, when we have been with God, and thus have our worldly employments sanctified to us by the word and prayer! Though they had taken nothing, yet Christ told them to let down their nets again. We must not abruptly quit our callings because we have not the success in them we desire. We are likely to speed well, when we follow the guidance of Christ's word. The draught of fishes was by a miracle. We must all, like Peter, own ourselves to be sinful men, therefore Jesus Christ might justly depart from us. But we must beseech him that he would not depart; for woe unto us if the Saviour depart from sinners! Rather let us entreat him to come and dwell in our hearts by faith, that he may transform and cleanse them. These fishermen forsook all, and followed Jesus, when their calling prospered. When riches increase, and we are tempted to set our hearts upon them, then to quit them for Christ is thankworthy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fear not - He calmed their fears.

From this and the parable of the seine or haulingnet (<a href="/matthew/13-47.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:">Matthew 13:47</a>) came the favorite early Christian symbol of the ‘Fish.’ “We little fishes,” says Tertullian, “after our Fish (<span class="greekheb">ΙΧΘΥΣ</span>, i. e. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ</span>) are born in the water (of baptism).” The prophecy was first fulfilled to Peter, when 3000 were converted by his words at the first Pentecost. In a hymn of St Clement of Alexandria we find “O fisher of mortals who are being saved, Enticing pure fish for sweet life from the hostile wave.” Thus, He who “spread the fisher’s net over the palaces of Tyre and Sidon, gave into the fisher’s hand the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” “He caught orators by fishermen, and made out of fishermen his orators.” We find a similar metaphor used by Socrates, Xen. <span class="ital">Mem.</span> ii. 6, “Try to be good and to catch the good.

A feeling of intense overpowering awe on a sudden came on Simon after listening to the words and seeing this last act of power which so closely affected him. The very fish of his native lake, then, were subject to this strange holy Man! This was no mortal, thought the fisherman, and he fell at the Master's feet. "Finding as it does its parallel in almost all manifestations of a Divine or even an angelic presence, it (this awful fear) must be owned to contain a mighty, because an instructive, witness for the sinfulness of man's nature, out of which it comes to pass that any near revelation from the heavenly world fills the children of men, even the holiest among them, with terror and amazement, yea, sometimes with the expectation of death itself" (Archbishop Trench, 'Introduction to the Epistles to the Seven Churches'). The same "Fear not" ("Be not afraid") was uttered on like occasions to Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm">Isaiah 6:7</a>), to Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>), and several times during the earthly ministry was said to the disciples, and for the last time the reassuring words were spoken by the Redeemer after the Ascension to his own dear follower, John, who could  not bear the sight of the glorious majesty of his risen Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">shalt catch men</span>. The imagery contained in these words of the Master to his fishermen-followers was, of course, drawn from the late scene. Their failure in catching fish, their Teacher's marvellous success, the net bursting with the great catch of silvery fish; the Lord's strange prophetic words which accompanied their call to his service, - all would in after-years often come up before the disciples in their hours of alternating failure and success in the mighty task he had set them to do. The great Fisherman, Christ; his imitators and servants, fishers; the world of men pictured as fish, - were ever favourite images for the pencil, the graving tool, and the pen of the Christian artist and writer of the first ages of the faith. One of the earliest extant hymns, for instance, of the Church, by Clement of Alexandria, dwells on the image. The words are addressed to Christ - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Fisher of men, the blest,<br />Out of the world's unrest,<br />Out of sin's troubled sea,<br />Taking us, Lord, to thee</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Out of the waves of strife<br />With bait of blissful life;<br />Drawing thy nets to shore,<br />With choicest fish, good store."</span><br /><br />(Hymn of Clement of Alexandria.) The favourite Christian monogram of the fish, carved on so many tombs in the Catacombs, belongs to the same imagery - the <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Partners (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>In <a href="/luke/5-7.htm">Luke 5:7</a> the word rendered partners is &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;; from &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, with, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;, to have. The word here denotes a closer association, a common interest. The kindred noun, &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, fellowship, is used of the fellowship of believers with Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>); the communion of the body and blood of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>); the communion of the Holy Ghost (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a>). The persons referred to in <a href="/luke/5-7.htm">Luke 5:7</a> might have been only hired workmen (<a href="/mark/1-20.htm">Mark 1:20</a>), temporarily associated with the principals.<p>Thou shalt catch (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., thou shalt be catching, the participle and finite verb denoting that this is to be his habitual calling. Both Matthew and Mark make the promise to be addressed to Peter and his companions; Luke to Peter alone. The verb &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to catch, is compounded of &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, living, and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to catch or take. Hence, lit., to take alive: in war, to take captive, instead of killing. Thus Homer, when Menelaus threatens the prostrate Adrastus:<p>"Adrastus clasped the warrior's knees and said,<p>O son of Atreus, take me prisoner" (&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;).<p>Iliad, vi., 45, 6; compare Iliad, x., 378.<p>So Herodotus: "The Persians took Sardis, and captured Croesus himself alive" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;). - I., 86.<p>There is certainly a reason for the use of this term, as indicating that Christ's ministers are called to win men to life. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>, where, according to the best supported rendering, the servant of God is represented as taking men alive out of the power of Satan, to be preserved unto the will of God; i.e., as instruments of his will (compare A. V. and Rev.). The word thus contains in itself an answer to the sneering remark of the Apostate Julian, that Christ aptly termed his apostles fishers; "for, as the fisherman draws out the fish from waters where they were free and happy, to an element in which they cannot breathe, but must presently perish, so did these."</body></html>
