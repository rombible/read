Fasting.<p>(See on [1577]Mt 9:14-17.)<p>The incongruities mentioned in Lu 5:36-38 were intended to illustrate the difference between the genius of the old and new economies, and the danger of mixing up the one with the other. As in the one case supposed, "the rent is made worse," and in the other, "the new wine is spilled," so by a mongrel mixture of the ascetic ritualism of the old with the spiritual freedom of the new economy, both are disfigured and destroyed. The additional parable in Lu 5:39, which is peculiar to Luke, has been variously interpreted. But the "new wine" seems plainly to be the evangelical freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be expected "straightway"&#8212;all at once&#8212;to take a liking for the former; that is, "These inquiries about the difference between My disciples and the Pharisees," and even John's, are not surprising; they are the effect of a natural revulsion against sudden change, which time will cure; the new wine will itself in time become old, and so acquire all the added charms of antiquity. What lessons does this teach, on the one hand, to those who unreasonably cling to what is getting antiquated; and, on the other, to hasty reformers who have no patience with the timidity of their weaker brethren!   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/5-33.htm" title="And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but your eat and drink?">Luke 5:33</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he spake also a parable unto them,.... The Scribes and Pharisees; illustrating what he had just now said: <p>no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; by "a piece of a new garment" meaning the new and upstart notions and traditions of the elders, which were so in comparison of the law of Moses; and by the "old", the robe of their own righteousness, wrought out in obedience to the moral and ceremonial law: and Christ suggests, that to join these together, in order to patch up a garment of righteousness, to appear in before God, was equally as weak and ridiculous, as to put a piece of new and undressed cloth into a garment that was old, and wore threadbare. <p>If otherwise, then both the new, maketh the rent; that is, much worse than it was, as it is expressed both in Matthew and Mark; the old and new cloth being unsuitable, and not of equal strength to hold together: by this Christ intimates, that the Jews, by being directed to the observance of the traditions of the elders, were drawn off from a regard to the commandments of God; so that instead of having a better righteousness, they had one much the worse, a ragged, and a rent one. <p>And the piece that was taken out of the new, agreeth not with the old; and so the statutes of men, and the ordinances of God, or the traditions of the elders, and the commands of God, are no more like one another, than the piece of a new and an old garment, and as unlike is obedience to the one, and to the other; <p>See Gill on <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a>.

The first of these, as given by Lk., varies in form from the version in the parallels, suggests somewhat different ideas, and is in itself by no means clear. Much depends on whether we omit or retain <span class="greekheb">σχίσας</span> in the first clause. If, with [52] [53] [54] [55], we retain it, the case put is: a piece cut out of a new garment to patch an old one, the evil results being: the new spoiled, and the old patched with the new piece presenting an incongruous appearance (<span class="greekheb">οὐ συμφωνήσει</span>). If, with [56] [57], etc., we omit <span class="greekheb">σχίσας</span>, the case put may be: a new piece not cut out of a new garment, but a <span class="ital">remnant</span> (Hahn) used to patch an old, this new piece making a rent in the old garment; <span class="greekheb">τὸ καινὸν</span> in second clause not object of, but nominative to, <span class="greekheb">σχίσει</span>, and the contrast between the new patch and old garment presenting a grotesque appearance. The objection to this latter view is that there is no reason in the case supposed why the new patch should make a rent. In Mt. and Mk. the patch is made with unfulled cloth, which will contract. But the remnant of cloth with which a new garment is made would not be unfulled, and it would not contract. The sole evil in that case would be a piebald appearance. On the whole it seems best to retain <span class="greekheb">σχίσας</span>, and to render <span class="greekheb">τὸ καινὸν σχίσει</span>, he (the man who does so foolish a thing) will rend the new. Kypke suggests as an alternative rendering: the new is rent, taking <span class="greekheb">σχίζει</span> intransitively, of which use he cites an instance from the Testament of the twelve patriarchs. The sense on this rendering remains the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[52] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[53] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[54] Codex Bezae<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] Codex Regius--eighth century, represents an ancient text, and is often in agreement with א and B.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] Codex Alexandrinus of the fifth century, a chief representative of the “Syrian” text, that is, the revised text formed by judicious eclectic use of all existing texts, and meant to be <span class="ital">the</span> authoritative New Testament.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] Codex Ephraemi<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">36</span>. <span class="ital">a piece of a new garment upon an old</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">no one rending a patch from a new garment putteth it upon an old garment</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">σχίσας</span> ‘rending’ though omitted in our version is found in <span class="greekheb">א</span>, A, B, D, L. Our Lord delighted in using these homely metaphors which brought the truth within the comprehension of his humblest hearers. St Matthew (<a href="/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.">Matthew 9:16</a>) has ‘a patch of unteazled cloth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">both the new maketh a rent</span>] Rather, with the best uncials, <span class="bld">he will both rend the new</span>. The inferior readings adopted by the E. V. make us lose sight of the fact that there is a <span class="ital">treble</span> mischief implied, namely, (1) the rending of the new to patch the old; (2) the incongruity of the mixture; (3) the increase of the rent of the old. The latter is mentioned only by St Matthew, but is implied by the bursten skins of the next similitude. Our Lord is referring to the proposal to enforce the ascetic leanings of the forerunner, and the Pharisaic regulations which had become a parasitic growth on the old dispensation, upon the glad simplicity of the new dispensation. To act thus, was much the same thing as using the Gospel by way of a mere adjunct to—a mere purple patch upon—the old garment of the Law. The teaching of Christ was a new and seamless robe which would only be spoilt by being rent. It was impossible to tear a few doctrines and precepts from Christianity, and use them as ornaments and improvements of Mosaism. If this were attempted (1) the Gospel would be maimed by the rending from its entirety; (2) the <span class="ital">contrast</span> between the new and the old system would be made more glaring; (3) the decay of the evanescent institutions would only be violently accelerated. Notice how distinctly these comparisons imply the ultimate abrogation of the Law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">agreeth not</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">will not agree</span> (<span class="ital">sumphonesei</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/5-36.htm" title="And he spoke also a parable to them; No man puts a piece of a new garment on an old; if otherwise, then both the new makes a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agrees not with the old.">Luke 5:36</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παραβολὴν</span>, <span class="ital">a parable</span>) From a garment, and from wine: a kind of parable especially appropriate at a banquet [<a href="/luke/5-29.htm" title="And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.">Luke 5:29</a>]: comp. ch. <a href="/luke/14-7.htm" title="And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying to them.">Luke 14:7</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ καινὸν</span>) <span class="ital">new</span>.[57]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] In the sense, <span class="ital">not worn out</span> by use, <span class="ital">different</span> from the old worn-out garments: but <span class="greekheb">νέον</span> applied to the wine, <span class="ital">new</span>, in the sense of <span class="ital">fresh, recent</span>, opposed to wine mellowed by age; <span class="greekheb">νέος</span> <span class="ital">is lately</span> originated, as opposed to that originated some time back; <span class="greekheb">καινὸς</span>, <span class="ital">not yet used, new</span>, and <span class="ital">different</span>, as opposed to that which was formerly: hence Jesus does not say <span class="greekheb">νέους ἀσκούς</span>, nor <span class="greekheb">ἱμάτιον νέον</span>, nor <span class="greekheb">οἶνον καινόν</span>, but <span class="greekheb">καινοὺς ἀσκούς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵματιον καινόν</span>, and <span class="greekheb">οἶνον νέον</span>.

Oriental teaching has ever delighted in using these vivid and picturesque metaphors and parables taken from the everyday life of the people; here the reference is, of course, to the question put by the. Pharisees and John's disciples respecting fasting. This and the following little parable, and the curious simile which he added directly after, is part of the Lord's answer to his questioners. They charged him in their query with throwing (by the neglect of fasting) a slur on the time-honoured practices and observances of the most religious men of Israel. His reply acknowledged that, as far as he was concerned, they were right. He had quietly put aside the rigidly appointed fasts and other ceremonial rites by means of which the great Jewish teachers - to use their own expression - had put a hedge about the Law. They were right, too, in the conclusion they had come to, implied but not expressed, in their evidently hostile questioning. His <span class="accented">was</span> a totally new form of the old Hebrew' religon - new altogether in the grandeur of its conception and in the breadth of its influence. His was a totally new garment that he was about to offer to the people; now to patch up the beautiful new work with the old one would be surely to mar both. In the older authorities the text is slightly longer and more vivid than the text from which our own more corrupt Authorized Version was translated. It would run thus: "No one rending a patch from a new garment putteth it upon an old garment." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A parable<p>"From a garment and from wine, especially appropriate at a banquet" (Bengel).<p>Putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>The best texts, however, insert &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, having rent, which directly governs &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, piece; so that the rendering is, No man having rent a piece from, a new garment, putteth it, etc. So Rev., No man tendeth a piece and putteth.
