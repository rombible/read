Strong confidence and deep humility are united in the words of this leper. And if any sinner, from a deep sense of vileness, says, I know the Lord can cleanse, but will he look upon such a one as me? will he apply his own precious blood for my cleansing and healing? Yes, he will. Speak not as doubting, but as humbly referring the matter to Christ. And being saved from the guilt and power of our sins, let us spread abroad Christ's fame, and bring others to hear him and to be healed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 5:12-16.

In order to prevent the accidental violation of this law, lepers, until the final stage of the disease, were then as now secluded from all living contact with others, “differing in nothing from a dead man” (Jos. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> iii. 11 § 3), and only appeared in public with the cry <span class="ital">Tamê, Tamê</span>—‘Unclean! Unclean!’ But Jesus, “because He is the Lord of the Law, does not obey the Law, but makes the Law” (St Ambrose); or rather, he obeys that divine eternal Law of Compassion, in its sudden impulse (<span class="greekheb">σπλαγχνισθεὶς</span>, <a href="/mark/1-40.htm" title="And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean.">Mark 1:40</a>), which is older and grander than the written Law. (So Elijah and Elisha had not scrupled to touch the dead, <a href="/1_kings/17-21.htm" title="And he stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray you, let this child's soul come into him again.">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm" title="And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and stretched himself on the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.">2 Kings 4:34</a>.) His touching the leper, yet remaining clean, is a type of His taking our humanity upon Him, remaining undefiled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I will: be thou clean</span>] Two words in the original—“a prompt echo to the ripe faith of the leper”—which are accurately preserved by all three Evangelists. Our Lord’s first miracles were done with a glad spontaneity in answer to faith. But when men had ceased to believe in Him, then lack of faith rendered His later miracles more sad and more delayed (<a href="/mark/6-5.htm" title="And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.">Mark 6:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a>). We never however hear of a moment s delay in attending to the cry of a leper. When the sinner cries from his heart, “I have sinned against the Lord,” the answer comes instantly, “The Lord also hath put away thy sin” (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm" title="And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.">2 Samuel 12:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the leprosy departed</span>] Jesus was not polluted by the touch, but the leper was cleansed. Even so he touched our sinful nature, yet without sin (H. de St Victore).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/5-13.htm" title="And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be you clean.

And immediately the leprosy departed from him</span>. St. Mark adds here, "being touched with compassion." The Redeemer, at the sight of the man's awful wretchedness - wasting away, shunned by all men, dragging on a hopeless, aimless, weary life - in his Divine pity, with a sudden impulse tosses aside all considerations of ceremonial uncleanness or contagion, and lays his hand on the miserable sufferer from whom all shrank, with his word of power exclaimed, "I will: be thou clean." St. Ambrose writes here how "Jesus, because he is the Lord of the Law, does not obey the Law, but makes the Law." "Here Jesus obeys that Divine eternal law of compassion, in its sudden impulse, which is older and grander than the written Law" (Farrar). It is observable that in these sudden cases, in which the common brotherhood of man was involved, the nobler spirits of  Israel ever rose above all consideration of law and custom, and, putting aside all legal, orthodox restriction, obeyed at once the sovereign dictates of the heart. So Elijah and Elisha, those true saints of God, shrank not from touching the dead. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I will (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;)<p>See on <a href="/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>.<p>Be thou clean (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., more accurately, gives the force of the passive voice, be thou made clean. </body></html>
