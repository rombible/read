Strong confidence and deep humility are united in the words of this leper. And if any sinner, from a deep sense of vileness, says, I know the Lord can cleanse, but will he look upon such a one as me? will he apply his own precious blood for my cleansing and healing? Yes, he will. Speak not as doubting, but as humbly referring the matter to Christ. And being saved from the guilt and power of our sins, let us spread abroad Christ's fame, and bring others to hear him and to be healed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

It is possible also that he withdrew into desert places oft times to avoid all show of ostentation, or dangers of tumults, and to obtain a little rest for himself. But suppose that the reason of his motion, yet the spending of his leisure hours in communion with his Father is very imitable for us. Christ had no idle hours, he was always either preaching or healing, thereby doing good to others; or praying, thereby paying a homage to God. If it could be said of the Roman, (with respect to his studies), it should be much more said of Christians, They should never be less alone than when they are alone, nor less idle than when they are most at leisure from their public employments. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness,.... Into a desert place, that he might have rest from the fatigues of preaching and healing diseases; and being alone, and free from company, might have an opportunity for private prayer to God, for so it lows: <p>and prayed; this is to be understood of Christ, as man: as God, he is the object of prayer, and petitions are often addressed unto him; and as mediator, he offers up the prayers of all saints, and presents them to his Father; which are acceptable to him, through the incense of his mediation; and as man, he prayed himself: what he now prayed for, is not known; sometimes he prayed for his disciples, and for all that should believe; for their conversion, sanctification, union, perseverance, and glorification; and sometimes for himself, that the cup might pass from him, and he be saved from death; but always with submission to the will of his Father. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/5-16.htm" title="And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.">Luke 5:16</a>.
