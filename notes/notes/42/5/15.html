Strong confidence and deep humility are united in the words of this leper. And if any sinner, from a deep sense of vileness, says, I know the Lord can cleanse, but will he look upon such a one as me? will he apply his own precious blood for my cleansing and healing? Yes, he will. Speak not as doubting, but as humbly referring the matter to Christ. And being saved from the guilt and power of our sins, let us spread abroad Christ's fame, and bring others to hear him and to be healed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

It is evident that his wishes and commands were neglected, possibly out of a mistaken feeling of gratitude. The result was that his work of teaching was hindered by the crowds who resorted to him at once as a Physician of extraordinary power. But he had graver and much more important work before him than even the blessed task of relieving suffering. So he withdrew himself, says our evangelist, and again spent a short season in solitude and prayer. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Went abroad (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; throughout the region.
