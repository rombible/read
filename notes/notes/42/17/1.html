This term skandala is used in the New Testament very variously; in general it signifies any thing which may be an occasion of mischief to another. Man, consisting of body and soul, may by something be made to stumble and fall, either with reference to the one, or to the other: thus, <span class="bld"><a href="/leviticus/19-14.htm" title="You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou</span> <span class="ital">shalt not put a stumblingblock before the blind:</span> lyvbm Hebrew: so <span class="bld"><a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm" title="Rejoice not when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles:">Proverbs 24:17</a></span>. The mischief done to our souls is by sin; so as in the New Testament it often signifies any action of ours by which our brother is made to sin: which actions may be, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Good and necessary, and then the scandal is taken, not given. Or: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Wicked and abominable; hence we call some sins scandalous sins, such as give offence to others, and are examples alluring them to sin. Or: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Actions which in themselves are of an indifferent nature, neither commanded nor forbidden in the word. Our taking one part in these actions, rather than another, may be a scandal, that is, an offence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What our Saviour here saith is certainly true concerning all these kinds of offences: considering the complexion of the world, and the corruption which is in man’s hearts, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">it is impossible but that offences will come.</span> But I must confess that I incline to think, that the <span class="bld">offences</span> primarily intended by our Saviour here are those of the second sort; and that by them are meant persecutions of the people of God; to the authors of which our Saviour denounces woe. So that our Saviour by this lets the world know, the special protection under which he hath taken his people; so as though he knew there would arise those who would hurt and destroy in his holy mountain, yet he declares that they shall not go unpunished, but they had better die the most certain death imaginable, (such must be the death of him who is thrown into the sea with a millstone about his neck), than to that degree expose himself to the vengeance of God; a guilt of that nature that there is not much more hope for him to escape God’s vengeance, than there would be of a man escaping with his life whom we should see thrown into the sea with a millstone appendant to him. I do very well know that it is also highly dangerous to tempt or solicit a child of God to sin, either by our words or actions; but I do not think it the design of our Lord in this place so much to express that as the other. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said he unto his disciples,....

The thread of connection here is not very obvious, and many expositors are content with regarding this seventeenth chapter as simply containing certain lessons of teaching placed here by St. Luke without regard to anything which preceded or succeeded them in the narrative, these expositors regarding the contents of this chapter as well authenticated sayings of the Master, which were repeated to Luke or Paul without any precise note of time or place, and which appeared to them too important for them to omit in these memoirs of the Divine life. Notwithstanding this deliberate opinion, endorsed by Godet and others, there does seem a clear connection here with the narrative immediately preceding. The Divine Master, while mourning over the sorrowful certainty of offences being committed in the present confused and disordered state of things, yet pronounces a bitter woe on the soul of the man through whose agency the offences were wrought. The "little cues" whom these offences would injure are clearly in this instance not children, although, of course, the words would include the very young, for whom Jesus ever showed the tenderest love; but the reference is clearly to disciples whose faith was only as yet weak and wavering - to men and women who would be easily influenced either for good or evil. The offences, then, especially alluded to were no doubt the worldliness and selfishness of professors of godliness. The sight of these, professedly serving God and all the while serving mammon more earnestly, would bring the very name of God's service into evil odour with some; while with others such conduct would serve as an example to be imitated. The selfish rich man of the great parable just spoken, professedly a religious man, one who evidently prided himself on his descent from Abraham the friend of God, and yet lived as a heartless, selfish sinner, who was eventually condemned for inhumanity, was probably in the Lord's mind when he spoke thus. What fatal injury to the cause of true religion would be caused by one such life as <span class="accented">that</span>! <span class="accented">It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he east into the sea.</span> This was a punishment not unknown among the ancients. The ancient Latin Version, and Marcion in his  recension of St. Luke, read here, "It were better for him that he had never been born, or that a millstone." etc. The awful sequel to a life which apparently had given the offence to which the Lord referred, endorses this terrible alternative. Yes; better indeed for him had that evil life been cut short even by such a death of horror as the Master pictures here, when he speaks of the living being cast into the sea bound to a millstone. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Impossible (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Inadmissible.
