It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-40.htm">Matthew 24:40-41</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. two in one bed&#8212;the prepared and unprepared mingled in closest intercourse together in the ordinary walks and fellowships of life, when the moment of severance arrives.

Very ancient authorities exhibit this versicle in Luke also, as well as in Matt. (<a href="/luke/24-40.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.">Luke 24:40</a>). Moreover, that it was not transferred here from Matthew, is evident from the difference of the words in Luke, as compared with those in Matthew, as also from the different order of the versicles in each Evangelist. [This is the reason for the change of the opinion which is found in the larger Ed. For both the margin of the Ed. 2 and of the Vers. Germ., following the example of the Gnomon, receive that clause concerning the two men in the field.—E. B.] Matthew has two paragraphs, viz. the one concerning the <span class="ital">field</span>, and that concerning the grinding at the <span class="ital">mill</span>: Luke adds a third, concerning the two men in one <span class="ital">bed</span>: just as on another occasion Matthew has two paragraphs concerning ‘following’ Jesus Christ, ch. <a href="/context/luke/8-19.htm" title="Then came to him his mother and his brothers, and could not come at him for the press....">Luke 8:19-20</a>; to which Luke adds a third, ch. <a href="/context/luke/9-61.htm" title="And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house....">Luke 9:61-62</a> [“Let me first go bid them farewell which are at home—No man having put his hand to the plough,” etc.]. So likewise the former Evangelist has two paragraphs or clauses, viz. concerning ‘bread,’ and concerning “a fish,” ch. <a href="/context/luke/7-9.htm" title="When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned him about, and said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel....">Luke 7:9-10</a> : the latter Evangelist adds a third, viz. that concerning an ‘egg’, ch. <a href="/luke/11-12.htm" title="Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?">Luke 11:12</a>.[194]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[194] D<span class="ital">abc</span> Vulg.

It was subsequently inserted in this place by copyists from <a href="/matthew/24-40.htm">Matthew 24:40</a>  - a passage in which much of the imagery here used was repeated by the Master. In one important feature this discourse differs from that delivered at Jerusalem a little later, and reported at length by St. Matthew in his twenty-fourth chapter. There is no reference here (in St. Luke) to the siege of Jerusalem; the whole teaching is purely teleological, and deals exclusively with what will take place at the close of this age. </body></html>
