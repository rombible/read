In our evangelist (where it is swma, not ptwma, as in Matthew, the word there properly signifying a dead body, the word here a living body) it seems to be applied to Christ’s glorious coming to judgment: Where I shall be, who am to be the Judge both of the quick and the dead, thither shall all the world be gathered before me, but my saints especially, who have eagles eyes, senses exercised to discern betwixt good and evil, to discern me as their Redeemer, and the true Messiah; according to that, <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/1-5.htm" title="Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.">Psalm 1:5</a>,6</span>. <span class="ital">Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

That is, either the Pharisees put this question to Christ, who demanded of him when the kingdom of God would come, <a href="/luke/17-20.htm">Luke 17:20</a> or rather the disciples, to whom Christ more especially directed his discourse, <a href="/luke/17-22.htm">Luke 17:22</a> who hearing of the distinction that would be made of persons in these dismal times, ask where it should be; not where the persons would be left, but whither the others would be taken, and by whom: and he said unto them, <p>wheresoever the body is; the carcass of the Jewish nation, as at Jerusalem chiefly, and in whatsoever place: <p>thither will the eagles be gathered together; the Roman army, whose ensign was the eagle; these will come, seize upon them, and take them and devour them, as they did: the Persic version renders it, "vultures"; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. These words can by no means be understood of sinners fleeing to Christ for eternal life and salvation; nor of the gathering of saints to him, at the last day; for how fitly soever such persons may be compared to "eagles", the word "body", or "carcass", as in <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a> and which is so read in some copies here, is not so suitable to Christ; and especially at his glorious appearing; and besides, the words are an answer to a question, where such persons would be, who would be taken and destroyed, when others would be left, or preserved; and manifestly refer to the body, or carcass of the Jewish people at Jerusalem, and other fortified places; where they should think themselves safe, but should not be so, the Roman armies gathering about them, and seizing them as their prey: it is yet a more strange interpretation, which is proposed by a very learned man (i); that by the "eagle" is meant, Christ; and by "the body", or "carcass", the church in the times of antichrist; and by "gathering" to it, the coming of Christ: for though Christ may be said to bear and carry his people, as the eagle bears and carries its young upon its wings, which he observes from <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a> yet not a single eagle, but "eagles", in the plural number, are here mentioned; which shows, that not a single person, as Christ, but many are here intended, even legions of Roman soldiers: nor can the church of Christ be compared to a dead and filthy carcass, in the worst of times, even in the times of antichrist; for however forlorn, distressed, and afflicted her condition is, she is kept alive, and in some measure pure from antichristian pollutions; and is represented by a woman, to whom two wings of a great eagle are given (wherefore she should rather be designed by the eagles) to fly with into the wilderness, where she is preserved and nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>. Nor is Christ's coming ever expressed by the gathering of him to his people; but on the other hand, they are always said to be gathered unto him; see <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>. <p>(i) Teelmaunus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?

Luke 21), some have attributed (Schleiermacher, p. 215 ff., 265 ff., Neander, Olshausen, Bleek), others have denied (de Wette), <span class="ital">originality</span> to Luke. The latter view depends upon the assertion of a want of connection, and partial inappropriateness of the expressions in Luke, which assumption, however, is not justified by the exposition. But the former cannot be allowed at the expense of Matthew (see especially Schleiermacher, who supposes in Matthew a mingling of the originally separate discourses, <a href="/luke/17-22.htm" title="And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.">Luke 17:22</a> ff; <a href="/luke/21-5.htm" title="And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,">Luke 21:5</a> ff.), since even in Matthew everything stands in strictly linked connection; but Luke 21, in the same way as Matthew, places the <span class="ital">Parousia</span> in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem, <a href="/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25</a> ff.

That the substance of its contents was repeated by Jesus Himself in the great discourse of Matthew 24, is, in respect of the similarity of the material, intelligible enough, and this holds good especially of the characteristic words—lightning, deluge, eagles. But it cannot be decided how much in the execution and form is carried over from the one discourse into the other by the mingling processes of reminiscence and tradition, the rather that in general we can ascribe to the discourses in the synoptic Gospels on the end of the world originality only within certain limits, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> originality modified by the reflection and expectation of the church (see on Matthew 24, Remarks).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/17-37.htm" title="And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord?

Some commentators both ancient and modern have interpreted ‘the body’ to mean Christ, and ‘the eagles’ His gathering Saints. Scriptural usage seems to make such an interpretation impossible, especially as there is probably a direct allusion to <a href="/job/39-30.htm" title="Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.">Job 39:30</a>, “Her young ones also suck up blood: <span class="ital">and where the slain are</span>, <span class="ital">there is she.”</span> See too <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm" title="Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm" title="Set the trumpet to your mouth.

Sometimes a reference is supposed to the eagle-standards of Rome. (Comp. <a href="/context/deuteronomy/28-49.htm" title="The LORD shall bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;...">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>; <a href="/john/11-48.htm" title="If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.">John 11:48</a>.) This is very possible especially as the Jews were very familiar with the Roman eagle, and so strongly detested it that the mere erection of the symbol in Jerusalem was sufficient to lash them into insurrection (Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xvii. 6, § 3).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the proverb has a far wider significance, and is illustrated by the rush of avenging forces whenever the life of a nation has fallen into dissolution and decay. See the vision of the eagle in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/11-45.htm" title="And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers nor thy malicious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body:">2Es 11:45</a>, “And therefore appear no more, O eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers, nor thy malicious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/17.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/17-37.htm" title="And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord?

"Where, Lord, will all this take place which thou hast been telling us about?" <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together</span>. The imagery is taken from <a href="/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>, "Where the slain are, there is she" (the eagle); the bird intended being most probably the great vulture, well known in Syria. It is seen, for instance, travellers tell us, in hundreds on the Plain of Gennesaret; it is a hideous looking bird, equal to the eagle in size and strength, and acts as a scavenger to purify the earth from the putrid carcases with which it would otherwise be encumbered. "Do you ask where all this will take place? As the curtain of the future rolls up be fore my inward eye, I see the vultures of Divine vengeance flying in flocks athwart the whole area of the earth; the sky is darkened with their numbers; far as my eye can reach, I still see them. Alas l for the habitable earth, my Father's goodly world...  it is rank everywhere with corruption..., wheresoever the carcase is, there the vultures will gather together" (Dr. Morrison). The Lord's answer to the question - "Where?" was that his words applied to the whole earth. The terrible and awful scenes he had pictured would take place everywhere. The carcase, as Godet phrases it, is "humanity, entirely secular and destitute of the life of God The eagles (vultures) represent punishment alighting on such a society." There is another interpretation of these words, which, although many great expositors favour it, must be rejected as improbable, being so alien to the context of the whole passage." The dead body (the carcase), according to these interpreters, is the body of Christ, and the eagles are his saints, who flock to his presence, and who feed upon him, especially in the act of Holy Communion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Eagles<p>See on <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. </body></html>
