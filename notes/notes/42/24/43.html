Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Honey-comb - Honey abounded in Palestine, and was a very common article of food.

That Jesus ate is carefully stated. The materiality thus evinced seems inconsistent with the pneumatic nature of Christ’s body as suggested by sudden appearing and departure, and with the immortal form of embodied life generally. Hahn suggests that the materiality was assumed by Jesus for the moment to satisfy the disciples that He had a body, and that He was risen. Euthy. Zig. expresses a similar view, stating that Jesus ate and digested supernaturally (<span class="greekheb">ὑπερφυῶς</span>), and that what He did to help the faith of the disciples was exceptional in reference to the immortal condition of the body, which can have nothing to do with wounds or food (<span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἕτερος μετὰ τὴν ἀφθαρσίαν τοῦ σώματος ὠτειλὰς ἕξει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ βρῶσιν προσήσεται</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">43.</span> <span class="ital">and did eat before them</span>] This was one of the ‘infallible proofs’ appealed to in <a href="/acts/1-3.htm" title="To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:">Acts 1:3</a>; comp. <a href="/context/john/21-12.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Come and dine.
