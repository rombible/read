Observe their surprise when they found the stone rolled away, and the grave empty. Christians often perplex themselves about that with which they should comfort and encourage themselves. They look rather to find their Master in his grave-clothes, than angels in their shining garments. The angels assure them that he is risen from the dead; is risen by his own power. These angels from heaven bring not any new gospel, but remind the women of Christ's words, and teach them how to apply them. We may wonder that these disciples, who believed Jesus to be the Son of God and the true Messiah, who had been so often told that he must die, and rise again, and then enter into his glory, who had seen him more than once raise the dead, yet should be so backward to believe his raising himself. But all our mistakes in religion spring from ignorance or forgetfulness of the words Christ has spoken. Peter now ran to the sepulchre, who so lately ran from his Master. He was amazed. There are many things puzzling and perplexing to us, which would be plain and profitable, if we rightly understood the words of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1-11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. in Galilee&#8212;to which these women themselves belonged (Lu 23:55).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/24-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:">Luke 24:4</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He is not here, but is risen,....
