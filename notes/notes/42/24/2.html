It does not imply that the angels, at their first appearing, were close by the women, as may be proved from the Greek translation of <a href="/genesis/18-2.htm" title="And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, see, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,">Genesis 18:2</a>, where, though it be said, that <span class="ital">Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, lo, three men </span>(<span class="greekheb">ειστηκεισαν επανω αυτω</span>) <span class="ital">stood by him, </span>it is added, that <span class="ital">when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, </span>which shows that they were at some distance from him. It is probable that both these angels were in a sitting posture when they first showed themselves to the women, because Mark affirms it expressly of the one whom he mentions, (<a href="/luke/24-5.htm" title="And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek you the living among the dead?">Luke 24:5</a>,) and because they showed themselves in this posture afterward to Mary Magdalene, <a href="/john/20-12.htm" title="And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.">John 20:12</a>. Or, the evangelists may be reconciled by supposing that the angel of whom Mark speaks, arose when the women went down into the sepulchre. See on <a href="/context/mark/16-3.htm" title="And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?...">Mark 16:3-6</a>. <span class="ital">And as they were afraid </span>— Mark says, <span class="greekheb">εξεθαμβηθησαν</span>, <span class="ital">affrighted, </span>or <span class="ital">terrified, </span>at this extraordinary and surprising sight; <span class="ital">and bowed down their faces to the earth</span> — Fixed their eyes upon it, in token of the profoundest respect; <span class="ital">they </span>— Namely, the angels; <span class="ital">said unto them </span>— This evangelist, having no intention to tell which of the angels spake, attributes to them both words, which, in the nature of the thing, could be spoken only by one of them, probably the one mentioned by Matthew and Mark, it being the custom, as has been just observed, of the sacred historians to mention one person or thing only, even in cases where more were concerned. <span class="ital">Why seek ye the living among the dead? </span>— Why are you come hither with materials for embalming one who is possessed of an immortal life? <span class="ital">He is not here, but is risen </span>— He has quitted the grave to return no more to it. <span class="ital">Remember how he spake when he was yet in Galilee </span>— Thus they refer the women to his own words, which if they and his other disciples had duly believed and observed, they would more easily have credited the fact when it took place. That the tidings, therefore, might not be such a surprise to them as they seemed to be, the angels repeat to them what Christ had often said in their hearing. <span class="ital">And they remembered his words </span>— When they were thus reminded of them. And now, doubtless, they were ashamed of the preparations they had made to embalm him on the third day, who had so often said, he would on the third day rise again.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 See the affection and respect the women showed to Christ, after he was dead and buried. Observe their surprise when they found the stone rolled away, and the grave empty. Christians often perplex themselves about that with which they should comfort and encourage themselves. They look rather to find their Master in his grave-clothes, than angels in their shining garments. The angels assure them that he is risen from the dead; is risen by his own power. These angels from heaven bring not any new gospel, but remind the women of Christ's words, and teach them how to apply them. We may wonder that these disciples, who believed Jesus to be the Son of God and the true Messiah, who had been so often told that he must die, and rise again, and then enter into his glory, who had seen him more than once raise the dead, yet should be so backward to believe his raising himself. But all our mistakes in religion spring from ignorance or forgetfulness of the words Christ has spoken. Peter now ran to the sepulchre, who so lately ran from his Master. He was amazed. There are many things puzzling and perplexing to us, which would be plain and profitable, if we rightly understood the words of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1-11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Lu 24:1-12.

It had been recently hewn out of a rock, the low ridge opposite the slight ascent of Calvary. "In front of a tomb belonging to a rich family there was generally a vestibule open to the air, then a low entrance sometimes, as in this case, on the side of a rock, leading into a square chamber of moderate dimensions, on one side of which was a place for the body, either cut some seven feet into the rock, or lengthways, three feet deep, with a low arch over it... The tomb had been lately made, and the door which closed the entrance, the only aperture into the tomb, was a large stone" ('Speaker's Commentary,' on <a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>). Recent investigations in Jerusalem serve to confirm the accuracy of the original traditional sites. (comp. Williams, 'Holy City,' 2:240; Professor Willis, 'Treatise on the Holy Sepulchre,' etc.). We find the following passage in the Bordeaux Pilgrim (A.D. 333): "On the left side (of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre) is the hillock Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified. Thence about a stone-throw distance is the crypt where his body was deposited." St. Cyril of Jerusalem makes several references to the spot. In the days of Eusebius (first half of the fourth century) there was no doubt as to the site. </body></html>
