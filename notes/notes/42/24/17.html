It well becomes the disciples of Christ to talk together of his death and resurrection; thus they may improve one another's knowledge, refresh one another's memory, and stir up each other's devout affections. And where but two together are well employed in work of that kind, he will come to them, and make a third. Those who seek Christ, shall find him: he will manifest himself to those that inquire after him; and give knowledge to those who use the helps for knowledge which they have. No matter how it was, but so it was, they did not know him; he so ordering it, that they might the more freely discourse with him. Christ's disciples are often sad and sorrowful, even when they have reason to rejoice; but through the weakness of their faith, they cannot take the comfort offered to them. Though Christ is entered into his state of exaltation, yet he notices the sorrows of his disciples, and is afflicted in their afflictions. Those are strangers in Jerusalem, that know not of the death and sufferings of Jesus. Those who have the knowledge of Christ crucified, should seek to spread that knowledge. Our Lord Jesus reproved them for the weakness of their faith in the Scriptures of the Old Testament. Did we know more of the Divine counsels as far as they are made known in the Scriptures, we should not be subject to the perplexities we often entangle ourselves in. He shows them that the sufferings of Christ were really the appointed way to his glory; but the cross of Christ was that to which they could not reconcile themselves. Beginning at Moses, the first inspired writer of the Old Testament, Jesus expounded to them the things concerning himself. There are many passages throughout all the Scriptures concerning Christ, which it is of great advantage to put together. We cannot go far in any part, but we meet with something that has reference to Christ, some prophecy, some promise, some prayer, some type or other. A golden thread of gospel grace runs through the whole web of the Old Testament. Christ is the best expositor of Scripture; and even after his resurrection, he led people to know the mystery concerning himself, not by advancing new notions, but by showing how the Scripture was fulfilled, and turning them to the earnest study of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What manner of communications ... - What is the subject of your conversation?

The relative clause <span class="greekheb">οὓς ἀντιβάλλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλ</span>. corresponds to the idea of <span class="greekheb">συζητεῖν</span> (disputare).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σὺ μόνος παροικεῖς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">Dost thou alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not learned</span>, etc.? In respect of this question of surprise, it is to be considered—(1) that the destiny of Jesus is so entirely the only thought in the soul of the two disciples, and appears to them now so absolutely as the only possible subject of their conversation and their sadness, that <span class="ital">from their standpoint</span> they instantly conclude from the question of the unknown one that he cannot at all <span class="ital">know</span> what has come to pass, since otherwise he would not begin by <span class="ital">asking</span> of what they speak and why they look sad; (2) that <span class="greekheb">μόνος</span> belongs to <span class="greekheb">παροικεῖς</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἔγνως</span>; so that thus <span class="greekheb">παροικεῖς Ἱερ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἔγνως</span> (there is no comma to be placed before <span class="greekheb">καί</span>), <span class="ital">taken together</span>, constitute the ground of their question, whether it is he alone in whose experience this is the case.
