Had St. Matthew given the two, it might have been urged by adverse critics that this duplication of phenomena, as in the case of the demoniacs (<a href="/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>), and the blind men at Jericho (<a href="/matthew/20-30.htm" title="And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.">Matthew 20:30</a>), was an idiosyncrasy of his. As it is, we must suppose that each set of informants—the two Maries, and the “others” from whom it seems probable that St. Luke’s report was derived—described what they themselves had seen. At such moments of terror and astonishment, perception and memory are not always very definite in their reports.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 See the affection and respect the women showed to Christ, after he was dead and buried. Observe their surprise when they found the stone rolled away, and the grave empty. Christians often perplex themselves about that with which they should comfort and encourage themselves. They look rather to find their Master in his grave-clothes, than angels in their shining garments. The angels assure them that he is risen from the dead; is risen by his own power. These angels from heaven bring not any new gospel, but remind the women of Christ's words, and teach them how to apply them. We may wonder that these disciples, who believed Jesus to be the Son of God and the true Messiah, who had been so often told that he must die, and rise again, and then enter into his glory, who had seen him more than once raise the dead, yet should be so backward to believe his raising himself. But all our mistakes in religion spring from ignorance or forgetfulness of the words Christ has spoken. Peter now ran to the sepulchre, who so lately ran from his Master. He was amazed. There are many things puzzling and perplexing to us, which would be plain and profitable, if we rightly understood the words of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1-11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Lu 24:1-12.

Matthew and Mark take notice but of one; but John makes mention of two, as here, seen by Mary Magdalene, though in a different posture; they were sitting, the one at the head, the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain; but when the rest of the women came, they were risen up, and stood close by them, on a sudden, at an unawares, being arrayed in white raiment, as white as snow, as a token of their purity and innocence, and as bringers of good tidings; and as joining in the triumph of their Lord's resurrection: their garments were bright and glittering like lightning, to set forth the glory and majesty of these celestial spirits, and that they might be known to be what they were. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/24.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/24-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:">Luke 24:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἄνδρες</span>, two <span class="ital">men</span> in appearance, but with angelic raiment (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐσθῆτι ἀστραπτούσῃ</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4.</span> <span class="ital">much perplexed</span>] The word means ‘utterly at a loss.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in shining garments</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">“flashing as with lightning</span>,which recalls the expression of <a href="/matthew/28-3.htm" title="His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:">Matthew 28:3</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/9-29.htm" title="And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.">Luke 9:29</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/24-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:">Luke 24:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄνδρες</span>, <span class="ital">men</span>) viz. angels.

Mary Magdalene, a little later, saw two angels in white sitting, as it were keeping watch and ward over the sepulchre for a short time after the sacred form had left it. The words which these beings from another sphere spoke to the mourning women were slightly different, but the teaching was the same in each case: "He is not here, but is risen. Do you not remember what he told you when he was yet with you?" Van Oosterzee and Farrar repeat a beautiful passage from Lessing on this: "Cold discrepancy-mongers, do you not, then, see that the evangelists do not count the angels?... There were not only two angels - there were millions of them. They appeared not always one and the same, not always the same two; sometimes this one appeared, sometimes that; sometimes on this place,- sometimes on that; sometimes alone, sometimes in company; sometimes they said this, sometimes they said that." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shining (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here and <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/17-24.htm">Luke 17:24</a>, Akin to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;, lightning.
