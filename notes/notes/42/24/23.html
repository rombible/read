It well becomes the disciples of Christ to talk together of his death and resurrection; thus they may improve one another's knowledge, refresh one another's memory, and stir up each other's devout affections. And where but two together are well employed in work of that kind, he will come to them, and make a third. Those who seek Christ, shall find him: he will manifest himself to those that inquire after him; and give knowledge to those who use the helps for knowledge which they have. No matter how it was, but so it was, they did not know him; he so ordering it, that they might the more freely discourse with him. Christ's disciples are often sad and sorrowful, even when they have reason to rejoice; but through the weakness of their faith, they cannot take the comfort offered to them. Though Christ is entered into his state of exaltation, yet he notices the sorrows of his disciples, and is afflicted in their afflictions. Those are strangers in Jerusalem, that know not of the death and sufferings of Jesus. Those who have the knowledge of Christ crucified, should seek to spread that knowledge. Our Lord Jesus reproved them for the weakness of their faith in the Scriptures of the Old Testament. Did we know more of the Divine counsels as far as they are made known in the Scriptures, we should not be subject to the perplexities we often entangle ourselves in. He shows them that the sufferings of Christ were really the appointed way to his glory; but the cross of Christ was that to which they could not reconcile themselves. Beginning at Moses, the first inspired writer of the Old Testament, Jesus expounded to them the things concerning himself. There are many passages throughout all the Scriptures concerning Christ, which it is of great advantage to put together. We cannot go far in any part, but we meet with something that has reference to Christ, some prophecy, some promise, some prayer, some type or other. A golden thread of gospel grace runs through the whole web of the Old Testament. Christ is the best expositor of Scripture; and even after his resurrection, he led people to know the mystery concerning himself, not by advancing new notions, but by showing how the Scripture was fulfilled, and turning them to the earnest study of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Certain women - See <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1-7</a>; <a href="/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>.<p>A vision of angels - An appearance of angels, or they had seen angels.

It is true, they add, some of our women gave us a surprise, telling us of a vision of angels they had at the empty grave this morning that said He was alive, and some of ourselves who went thither confirmed their statement; but then Himself they saw not.

In the sepulchre, as they expected, and so could not do what they intended: <p>they came; they returned from the sepulchre with great haste, and in a very great fright, and came to the disciples, where they were assembled; <p>saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels. The Syriac and Persic versions add, "there"; at the sepulchre, for there were two of them at least, if not three; see <a href="/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>. They not only reported, that they could not find the body of Jesus, but also that they had seen some angels: or the sense may be, that they told them, that though they could not find the dead body of their Lord, yet they had seen him alive, as they did by the way, as they were returning, <a href="/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a> and also that a vision of angels had appeared to them: <p>which said that he was alive; see <a href="/luke/24-5.htm">Luke 24:5</a>. So that it was not a deception of their sight, they certainly saw both Christ and the angels; and were assured from their testimony, as well as by their own eyes and ears, that he was certainly risen: now, though this was so clear a point, and so well attested, the disciples knew not how to believe it; they were perplexed about it; they could neither receive it, nor discredit it; they hoped it might be so, but feared it was not. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/24.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/24-23.htm" title="And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.">Luke 24:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">μὴ εὑροῦσαι</span>, etc.: that part of the women’s story—the body gone—is accepted as a fact; their explanation of the fact is regarded as doubtful, as appears from the cautious manner of expression.—<span class="greekheb">λέγουσαι</span>, etc., they came <span class="ital">saying</span> that they had also seen a <span class="ital">vision</span> of angels who <span class="ital">say</span>.
