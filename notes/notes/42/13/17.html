Even bodily infirmities, unless very grievous, should not keep us from public worship on sabbath days. This woman came to Christ to be taught, and to get good to her soul, and then he relieved her bodily infirmity. This cure represents the work of Christ's grace upon the soul. And when crooked souls are made straight, they will show it by glorifying God. Christ knew that this ruler had a real enmity to him and to his gospel, and that he did but cloak it with a pretended zeal for the sabbath day; he really would not have them be healed any day; but if Jesus speaks the word, and puts forth his healing power, sinners are set free. This deliverance is often wrought on the Lord's day; and whatever labour tends to put men in the way of receiving the blessing, agrees with the design of that day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Adversaries - The ruler of the synagogue, and those who felt as he did.<p>All the people - The persons who attended the synagogue, and who had witnessed the miracle. It is to be remarked:<p>1. That those who opposed Christ were chiefly the "rulers." They had an "interest" in doing it. Their popularity was at stake. They were afraid that he would draw off the people from them.<p>2. The common people heard him gladly. Many of them believed in him. The condition of the poor, and of those in humble life, is by far the most favorable for religion, and most of the disciples of Jesus have been found there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. ought not, &c.&#8212;How gloriously the Lord vindicates the superior claims of this woman, in consideration of the sadness and long duration of her suffering, and of her dignity notwithstanding, as an heir of the promise!<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is one thing to be ashamed, another thing to be convinced, so as to confess an error; they were ashamed that they were so put to silence before the people, but we read of no confession of their error and mistake, and begging Christ’s pardon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The people rejoiced</span> and gave thanks to God <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">for all the glorious things that were done</span> by our Saviour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he had said these things,.... Had argued with them from their own practices, and in a way so strong and rational, that carried such evidence and conviction with it: <p>all his adversaries were ashamed; not only the ruler of the synagogue, but the Scribes and Pharisees, that were present, who followed him wherever he went, and were his implacable enemies; these were confounded and silenced; shame appeared in their countenances; they could not lift up their heads, and look him in the face. <p>And all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him; for the doctrines he taught, and the miracles he wrought, and his wise and close reasonings at this time, to the shame and confusion of all that opposed him: for his audience consisted of different sorts, and what he said, and did, had different effects upon them. Some were filled with joy, and others with wrath, malice, and envy. And this is true with respect to spiritual and eternal things. Glorious things have been done by Christ in eternity, by becoming the surety of his people, by entering into a covenant with his Father on their account, and by taking the care and charge of their persons, and of all grace, blessings, and promises for them; and in time, by assuming their nature, fulfilling the law, bringing in an everlasting righteousness, making peace and reconciliation, procuring pardon, and finishing the work of redemption and salvation; and now in heaven, by entering as the forerunner for them, appearing in the presence of God on their account, presenting their prayers, and making intercession for them: and these are glorious things; they make for the glory of all the divine perfections; they issue in the glory of Christ himself; and in consequence of them, the saints enjoy eternal glory and happiness: these are things of the greatest importance, are wonderful and amazing, and for which saints and angels will glorify God both here and hereafter; and these occasion joy, and gladness in the Lord's people now. For not carnal and profane persons, or hypocrites, and formal professors, or Pharisees, and self-righteous persons rejoice at these things; but such as are the Lord's own people, who are openly his; who have passed under a work of the Spirit of God, who have seen their need of these things, and are sensible of the value of them; who know Christ, and love him, and believe in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/13-17.htm" title="And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.">Luke 13:17</a>.
