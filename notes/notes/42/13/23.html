And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.">Acts 2:47</a>, where the English version gives, with a singular infelicity, “such as should be saved.”<p>We are left to conjecture to what class the questioner belonged, and what feelings prompted the question. Was he thinking of salvation in the higher Christian sense of the term, or of safety from that destruction of which Christ had spoken as coming on the impenitent people? In the mind of the questioner the two things may have been blended together, but the answer clearly points to the former, and we have sufficient evidence that such questions were agitating men’s minds in the apocryphal Revelation known as the Second Book of Esdras. This book is probably (in part, at least, certainly, see <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-28.htm" title="Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before thee: but remember them, which according to thy will have known thy fear.">2 Esdras 8:28-29</a>), post-Christian, and has been assigned to the time of Nero, or Domitian, or Trajan; but it reflects with a wonderful fulness the fevered, anxious thoughts that were working among both Jews and Gentiles, and among those none is so prominent as that “many are created, but few shall be saved” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-1.htm" title="And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few.">2 Esdras 8:1</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-3.htm" title="There be many created, but few shall be saved.">2 Esdras 8:3</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-55.htm" title="And therefore ask thou no more questions concerning the multitude of them that perish.">2 Esdras 8:55</a>). Among the strange cabbalistic fancies of the Rabbis, one was an attempt to fix the number of the saved by the numerical value of the letters of this or that text that prophesied of the Kingdom of Heaven. Assuming the question to be of this nature, its form indicates that it was a speculative inquiry. A man anxious and in earnest would have asked, “What must I do to be saved?” And, being a speculative question, our Lord put it aside, gave no direct answer, and sought to force the man back on the thought of what was needed that he himself might take his place in that company.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:23-30 Our Saviour came to guide men's consciences, not to gratify their curiosity. Ask not, How many shall be saved? But, Shall I be one of them? Not, What shall become of such and such? But, What shall I do, and what will become of me? Strive to enter in at the strait gate. This is directed to each of us; it is, Strive ye. All that will be saved, must enter in at the strait gate, must undergo a change of the whole man. Those that would enter in, must strive to enter. Here are awakening considerations, to enforce this exhortation. Oh that we may be all awakened by them! They answer the question, Are there few that shall be saved? But let none despond either as to themselves or others, for there are last who shall be first, and first who shall be last. If we reach heaven, we shall meet many there whom we little thought to meet, and miss many whom we expected to find.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then said one - Who this was does not appear. It is probable that he was not one of the disciples, but one of the Jews, who came either to perplex him, or to involve him in a controversy with the Pharisees.<p>Are there few that be saved? - It was the prevalent opinion among the Jews that few would enter heaven. As but two of all the hosts that came out of Egypt entered into the land of Canaan, so some of them maintained that a proportionally small number would enter into heaven (Lightfoot). On this subject the man wished the opinion of Jesus. It was a question of idle curiosity. The answer to it would have done little good. It was far more important for the man to secure his own salvation, than to indulge in such idle inquiries and vain speculations. Our Lord therefore advised "him," as he does "all, to strive" to enter into heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

By this speech of our Saviour’s he diverts them from that curious question, about the number of those that shall be saved.

Not one of his disciples, but one of the company, in some one of the cities or villages he passed through, or as he was in the road to Jerusalem: <p>are there few that be saved? It is a received opinion among the Jews (z), that all Israel shall have a part in the world to come; and this man might put the question to know whether Christ was of this sentiment or not. And by some things he had observed drop from him, and it may be the foregoing parables, which express the small beginnings of his kingdom, and seem to signify, that at first his Gospel should be received but by a few, though it should afterwards spread, he might collect, that his sense was, there would be but a few saved; or this might be a question of mere curiosity and speculation, as it seems to be, by Christ's treatment of it, who does not give a direct answer to it, but puts him and others upon showing a concern for their own salvation. <p>And he said unto them; not to the man only that put the question, but to the whole company; though the Persic and Ethiopic versions read, "he said unto him", as follows. <p>(z) Misn.

There is nothing to shew whether it was suggested by speculative curiosity, or by despondent pity. But without directly rebuking such questions, our Lord, as in other instances, strove to place the questioners in a wiser frame of mind (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm" title="The secret things belong to the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>). The answer is a direct discouragement to all pitiless, and especially to all self-righteous, eschatologies. It is a solemn assertion of the necessity for earnest, personal endeavour. Thus to all idle attempts to define the certainties of the future, our Lord says, Consider the question with reference to <span class="ital">yourself,</span> not with reference to <span class="ital">others.</span> Look at it in the spirit of the publican, not in the spirit of the Pharisee. The wisdom and necessity of the answer may be seen from 2 Esdras 8., where the question is discussed, and where it is <span class="ital">assumed</span> that few only will be saved, “The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/8-1.htm" title="And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few.">2Es 8:1</a>). “There are many more of them which perish than of them which shall be saved; like as a wave is greater than a drop” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/9-15.htm" title="I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved:...">2Es 9:15-16</a>). “Let the multitude perish then” (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/9-22.htm" title="Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect.">2Es 9:22</a>). Part, at least, of the Book of Esdras is probably post-Christian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that be saved</span>] Literally, “<span class="ital">who are being saved,</span><span class="bld">”</span> i.e. who are in the way of salvation. The same word occurs in <a href="/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.">Acts 2:47</a>, and is the opposite to <span class="ital">apollumenoi,</span> ‘those that are perishing,’ <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/13-23.htm" title="Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that be saved?

The words of the Second Book of Esdras, written perhaps forty or fifty years after this time, well reflect this selfish spirit of harsh exclusiveness, peculiarly a characteristic of the Jew in the days of our Lord. "The Most High hath made this world for many, but the world to come for few" (2 Esdr. 8:1). "There be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved: like as a wave is greater than a drop" (2 Esdr. 9:15, 16). Other passages breathing a similar spirit might be quoted. What relics we possess of Jewish literature of this period all reflect the same stern, jealous, exclusive spirit. The questioner here either hoped to get from the popular Master some statement which might be construed into an approval of this national spirit of hatred of everything that was not Jewish, or, if Jesus chose to combat these selfish hopes, the Master's words might then be quoted to the people as unpatriotic. </body></html>
