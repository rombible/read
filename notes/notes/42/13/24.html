Ask not, How many shall be saved? But, Shall I be one of them? Not, What shall become of such and such? But, What shall I do, and what will become of me? Strive to enter in at the strait gate. This is directed to each of us; it is, Strive ye. All that will be saved, must enter in at the strait gate, must undergo a change of the whole man. Those that would enter in, must strive to enter. Here are awakening considerations, to enforce this exhortation. Oh that we may be all awakened by them! They answer the question, Are there few that shall be saved? But let none despond either as to themselves or others, for there are last who shall be first, and first who shall be last. If we reach heaven, we shall meet many there whom we little thought to meet, and miss many whom we expected to find.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Strive - Literally, "agonize." The word is taken from the Grecian games. In their races, and wrestlings, and various athletic exercises, they "strove or agonized," or put forth all their powers to gain the victory. Thousands witnessed them. They were long trained for the conflict, and the honor of victory was one of the highest honors among the people. So Jesus says that we should strive to enter in; and he means by it that we should be diligent, be active, be earnest; that we should make it our first and chief business to overcome our sinful propensities, and to endeavor to enter into heaven. This same figure or allusion to the Grecian games is often used in the New Testament, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-26</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>.<p>Strait gate - See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13-14</a>. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 32) says: "I have seen these strait gates and narrow ways, 'with here and there a traveler.' They are in retired corners, and must be sought for, and are opened only to those who knock; and when the sun goes down and the night comes on, they are shut and locked. It is then too late."<p>Will seek to enter in - Many in various ways manifest some desire to be saved. They seek it, but do not agonize for it, and hence, they are shut out. But a more probable meaning of this passage is that which refers this "seeking" to a time that shall be "too late;" to the time when the master has risen up, etc. In this life they neglect religion, and are engaged about other things. At death, or at the judgment, they will seek to enter in; but it will be too late - the door will be shut; and because they did not make religion the chief business of their life, they cannot "then" enter in.<p>Shall not be able - This is not designed to affirm anything respecting the inability of the sinner, provided he seeks salvation in a proper time and manner. It means that at the time when many will seek - when the door is shut - they will not be able then to enter in, agreeable to <a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>. In the proper time, when the day of grace was lengthened out, they "might" have entered in; but there "will be" a time when it will be too late. The day of mercy will be ended, and death will come, and the doors of heaven barred against them. How important, then, to strive to enter in while we have opportunity, and before it shall be too late! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

What is meant by the strait gate, and by entering in at it; see Gill on <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13</a>. To "strive", is to be diligent in the use of means; to search the Scriptures with care; to attend on the preaching of the word with constancy, neglecting no opportunity; to pray earnestly for spiritual light, knowledge, and grace; to contend with every enemy that opposes the salvation of the soul, as sin, Satan, and the world; to bear all reproaches and persecutions, and press through all difficulties, for the prize of the incorruptible crown: the metaphor seems to be taken from the striving, wrestling, and combat in the Olympic games, for a corruptible crown: <p>for many I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able: either when it is too late, when the door is shut; or else before, very faintly, in a superficial manner, from a mere natural affection, from a principle of self-love, which leads every one to desire happiness; and by very indirect and improper methods, by their own civility, morality, and righteousness; by works of the law, moral, or ceremonial; or by a profession of religion, and an outward compliance with the ordinances of the Gospel, and not by Christ, and faith in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/luke/13-24.htm" title="Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.">Luke 13:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πρὸς αὐτούς</span>] refers to those who were present, of whom the questioner was one.

Therein is implied: “Instead of concerning yourselves with the question whether they who attain to salvation are only <span class="ital">few</span>, reflect rather that <span class="ital">many shall not</span> attain it, and set out therefore on the right road to attaining it.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς στενῆς θύρας</span>] (see the critical remarks) reminds us of a house which has, besides the usual door, also a distinct <span class="ital">small</span> one, and only by means of this is admission possible: so the attainment of salvation is possible only by means of the <span class="greekheb">μετάνοια</span>. The figurative representation, which Jesus has already made use of in the Sermon on the Mount, <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm" title="Enter you in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:">Matthew 7:13</a>, is here repeated and modified; the <span class="ital">simple</span> <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς στεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">θύρ</span>., without any more definite explanation (comp., on the other hand, Matt. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>), bears the stamp of a reference to something already previously propounded (in opposition to de Wette, Weiss, and others, who are in doubt as to the originality of the saying in this place).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ζητήσουσιν</span>] weaker than <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνίζεσθε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰσελθεῖν</span>] in general; <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς στενῆς θύρας</span> is not repeated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἰσχύσουσιν</span>] because they omit <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνίζεσθαι εἰσελθεῖν διὰ τῆς στενῆς θύρας</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> they have not repented.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/13-24.htm" title="Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.">Luke 13:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνίζεσθε εἰς</span>.: stronger than Mt.’s <span class="greekheb">εἰσέλθετε</span>, suggesting the idea of a struggle or prize-fight (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm" title="And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things.

The Kingdom of Heaven is here conceived of as a house.—<span class="greekheb">πολλοί</span>: the idea is that many shall desire admission and shall not obtain it.

The Master, as was frequently his custom, gave no direct answer to his questioner, but his teaching which immediately follows contained the answer to the query. The older authorities, in place of "at the strait gate," read "through the narrow door." The meaning of the image, however, is the same, whichever reading be adopted. The image was not a new one. It had been used before by the Lord, perhaps more than once (see <a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>), and not improbably had been suggested by some town or fortress hard by the spot where he was teaching - a fort on a hill with a narrow road winding up to a narrow door. In the rabbinical schools he frequented in his youth, he might, too, have heard some adaptation of the beautiful allegory known as the 'Tablet' of Cebes, the disciple of Socrates: "Dost thou not perceive a narrow door, and a pathway before the door, in no way crowded, but few, very few, go in thereat?" The teaching of the Master here is, that the door of salvation is a narrow one, and, to pass through it, the man must <span class="accented">strive</span> in real earnest. "See," he seems to say; "if only few are saved, it will not be because the Jews are few and the Gentile nations many, but because, of the Jews and Gentiles, only <span class="accented">a few</span> really strive. Something different from race or national privileges will be the test at that narrow door which leads to life. "Many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able." The reason for the exclusion of these many is to be sought in themselves. They <span class="accented">wished to</span> enter in, but confined themselves to wishes. They made no strong, vigorous efforts. Theirs was no life of stern self-surrender, of painful self-sacrifice. To wish to pass through that narrow door is not enough. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Strive<p>Used only by Luke and Paul, except <a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>.
