It now seems as if he left things at large, and made no distinction between his faithful servants and those who falsely pretend to be such. But the time is coming when he will rise up <span class="ital">and shut to the door </span>— Namely, a door of distinction and separation between hypocrites and true believers; between formalists, who have only a name to live, and such as are truly alive to God. Now in the temple of the church there are carnal professors, who worship in the outer court, and spiritual worshippers, who worship within the veil; between these the door is now open, and they meet promiscuously in the same external performances; but when the <span class="ital">master of the house is risen up, </span>the door will be shut between them, and those who are in the outer court shall be kept out, and remain excluded for ever. Alas! how many that were very confident they should be saved, will be rejected in the day of trial! <span class="ital">And ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door </span>— Then, neither asking, nor seeking, nor knocking, nay, nor agonizing, will avail any thing. Let us now, therefore, strive and agonize, by faith, prayer, holiness, patience. Observe, reader, many are ruined by an ill-grounded hope of heaven, which they never once distrusted or called in question; and they conclude their state as good, because they never doubted the goodness of it. They call Christ, <span class="ital">Lord, </span>as if they were his servants; nay, in token of their confidence and importunity, they double the expression, <span class="ital">Lord, Lord; </span>and are now desirous to enter in by that door which they formerly slighted, and would now gladly have a place among those serious Christians whom they formerly despised! <span class="ital">And he shall answer and say, I know you not, </span>&c. <span class="ital">— I know my sheep, and am known of mine; </span>but I know not you; you do not belong to my family; you are neither my servants nor my subjects; I have neither employed nor governed you. Alas! how new, how late, how lasting will be the sense which they will now have of their misery! <span class="ital">Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, </span>&c. — Over and above the privileges which you have enjoyed by the Mosaic dispensation, you shall plead, on that occasion, the peculiar favour which I showed you in the days of my flesh, by exercising my ministry among you, and by conversing familiarly with you. <span class="ital">But he shall say, </span>&c. — He will persist in disowning you, whatever acquaintance with him you may pretend to; declaring again, <span class="ital">I know you not whence ye are </span>— All the former relations to which you refer, are, as it were, blotted from my remembrance, since your hearts were still insincere, or unchanged, and your lives unsuitable to your fair professions; <span class="ital">depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity </span>— For none like you can ever be admitted here. In the character which he here gives them, we have the reason of their doom: they were, and continued to be, <span class="ital">workers of iniquity, </span>and under a pretence of piety, persisted, though perhaps secretly, in the practice of sin.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:23-30 Our Saviour came to guide men's consciences, not to gratify their curiosity. Ask not, How many shall be saved? But, Shall I be one of them? Not, What shall become of such and such? But, What shall I do, and what will become of me? Strive to enter in at the strait gate. This is directed to each of us; it is, Strive ye. All that will be saved, must enter in at the strait gate, must undergo a change of the whole man. Those that would enter in, must strive to enter. Here are awakening considerations, to enforce this exhortation. Oh that we may be all awakened by them! They answer the question, Are there few that shall be saved? But let none despond either as to themselves or others, for there are last who shall be first, and first who shall be last. If we reach heaven, we shall meet many there whom we little thought to meet, and miss many whom we expected to find.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When once the master ... - The figure here used is taken from the conduct of a housekeeper, who is willing to see his friends, and who at the proper time keeps his doors open. But there is a proper time for closing them, when he will not see his guests. At night it would be improper and vain to seek an entrance - the house would be shut. So there is a proper time to seek an entrance into heaven; but there will be a time when it will be too late.

We are also further instructed, that no outward privileges though Christ hath taught in our streets; no external acts of communion with Christ, though we can say we have ate and drunk with him; will justify our hopes of entrance into heaven, if in the mean time we be workers of iniquity.

The Persic version adds, "nay, but be ye gone hence", for the following reason, <p>I know you not, whence you are: not but that Christ being the omniscient God, will know who they are, from whence they come, of what country and place they be, and to whom they belong; but the sense is, that he will not own them, and express any approbation of them, as his; but will treat them as strangers, that come, it is not known, from whence; he will reject them, as not being born from above, as not being the sheep of his fold, or members of his true church: they did not come from heaven, they were not heaven born souls, or partakers of the heavenly calling, and therefore shall not be received there; they belonged to the men of the world, and were of their father the devil, and shall be sent to him: so the foolish virgins, or formal professors of religion, and such as have been preachers of the Gospel, will entreat Christ at the last day, and shall have such an answer as this returned to them, which will be very awful and startling; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/7-23.htm">Matthew 7:23</a>, <a href="/matthew/25-12.htm">Matthew 25:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/luke/13-25.htm" title="When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not from where you are:...">Luke 13:25-27</a>.[163] If you are <span class="ital">excluded</span> from the kingdom of Messiah, you shall then in vain urge your external connection with me! <span class="greekheb">Πλάττει γὰρ οἰκοδεσπότην τινὰ καθήμενον κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὐποδεχόμενον</span> (at the repast, <a href="/luke/13-29.htm" title="And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.">Luke 13:29</a>) <span class="greekheb">τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ</span> (rather his family; see subsequently on <span class="greekheb">πόθεν</span>), <span class="greekheb">εἶτα ἐγειρόμενον κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀποκλείοντα τὴν θύραν τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μὴ συγχωροῦντα τοῖς ἄλλοις εἰσελθεῖν</span>, Euthymius Zigabenus.

Here begins a new parable and a new sentence, though some (Beza, Lachmann, W. and H[115]) connect with what goes before, putting a comma after <span class="greekheb">ἰσχύσουσιν</span>. Against this is not only the change from the third person to the second (<span class="greekheb">ἄρξησθε</span>), but the fact that the cause of exclusion is different: not the narrowness of the door, but <span class="ital">coming too late</span>. The case put now is that of the master of a house who is giving an entertainment. He waits for a certain time to receive his guests. At length, deeming that all are, or ought to be, present, he rises and shuts the door, after which no one can be admitted. Some, however, come later, knock at the door, and are refused admission. The moral of this parable is distinct; of the former parable it was: be in earnest; of this it is: be not too late.—<span class="greekheb">ἑστάναι καὶ κρούειν</span>: both verbs depend on <span class="greekheb">ἄρξησθε</span>: ye begin to stand without and to knock. Some take <span class="greekheb">ἑστάναι</span> as = a participle, but it is better to take it as denoting a first stage in the action of those arriving late. At first they expect that the door will be opened soon as a matter of course, and that they have nothing to do but to step in. By-and-by they find it will be necessary to knock, and finally, being refused admission even when the door is opened, they are fain to plead (<a href="/luke/13-26.htm" title="Then shall you begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets.">Luke 13:26</a>).—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς</span>: the <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> here has the force of <span class="ital">then</span>.

The great Teacher here slightly changes the imagery. The narrow door no longer is the centre of the picture; one, called the "master of the house," becomes the principal figure. The door now shut may still be, most probably is, the narrow fort or hill-city entrance, and the one called the master is the governor of the Place of Arms, into which the door or gate led. It is now too late even for the earnest striver to enter in. Sunset probably  - the shades of night, had the Divine Painter furnished the imagery - would have been the signal for the final closing of the door of the fortress. Death is the period when the door of salvation is shut to the children of men. It has been asked - To what time does the Master refer in the words" when once"? It cannot be the epoch of the ruin of Jerusalem and the breaking up of the Jewish nationality, for then there was nothing in the attitude of the doomed people to answer to the standing without, to the knocking at the door, and to the imploring cries, "Lord, Lord, open unto us," portrayed here. It cannot be the second coming of the Lord; surely then his people will not call on him in vain. It refers, without doubt, to the day of judgment, when the dread award will be pronounced upon the unbelieving, the selfish, and the evil-liver. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>When once (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;' ou)<p>Lit., from the time that.
