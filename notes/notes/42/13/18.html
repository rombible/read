The first impression with most readers, in the absence of any apparent trace of sequence, is that we have an isolated fragment of our Lord’s teaching, torn from the context in which we find it in St. Matthew. On the other hand, we must remember (1) that our Lord was in the synagogue, and it was on the Sabbath day, and that so both time and place called for teaching of some kind; and (2) that the parables that follow may well be regarded but as samples of the teaching which those who were in the synagogue had treasured up in their memories. They were fit and edifying parables at any time; not least so, assuredly, at this. When proof had been given that the Kingdom of God had indeed come nigh unto men, it was well to set before them something as to its nature, its extent, its mode of working inwardly and outwardly; and the fact that the similitudes which did this had been used before, did not necessarily make them inapplicable or unprofitable when used again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/13-18.htm" title="Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?...">Luke 13:18-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? </span>— After the Lord had thus silenced the ruler of the synagogue, and while he observed the rejoicings of the people, he reflected with pleasure on the reason and truth which so effectually supported his kingdom. For he delivered a second time the parables of the grain of mustard-seed, and of the leaven, to show the efficacious operation of the gospel upon the minds of men, and its speedy propagation through the world in spite of all opposition.

The parable of "the Leaven" sets forth, perhaps, rather the inward growth of the kingdom, while "the Mustard Seed" seems to point chiefly to the outward. It being a woman's work to knead, it seems a refinement to say that "the woman" here represents the Church, as the instrument of depositing the leaven. Nor does it yield much satisfaction to understand the "three measures of meal" of that threefold division of our nature into "spirit, soul, and body," (alluded to in 1Th 5:23) or of the threefold partition of the world among the three sons of Noah (Ge 10:32), as some do. It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief parable just the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all institutions and tribes of men, and exhibit over the whole earth one "Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ."

This is how we find it in Luke; and his mode of connecting them with the context is so consistent with the facts, that from this quarter there is no opposition to our assuming as original in this place what, if not an exact repetition of the two parables already spoken at Matthew 13 and Mark 4, was at least an express reference to them. Even in the source of his narrative of the journey from which Luke draws from <a href="/luke/9-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,">Luke 9:51</a> onwards, they might have been connected with the foregoing section, <a href="/context/luke/13-10.htm" title="And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath....">Luke 13:10-17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/luke/13-19.htm" title="It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.">Luke 13:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς κῆπον ἑαυτοῦ</span>] <span class="ital">into a garden belonging to himself</span>, where it was protected, where he could observe and foster it, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/luke/13-20.htm" title="And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?">Luke 13:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>] <span class="ital">once more</span>; for the question of <a href="/luke/13-18.htm" title="Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?">Luke 13:18</a> is <span class="ital">repeated</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/luke/13-18.htm" title="Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?...">Luke 13:18-21</a>. <span class="ital">The parables of the mustard seed and the leaven</span> (<a href="/context/matthew/13-31.htm" title="Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:...">Matthew 13:31-33</a>, <a href="/context/mark/4-30.htm" title="And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?...">Mark 4:30-32</a>). Lk. may have introduced these parables here either because the joy of the people was in his view the occasion of their being spoken, Jesus taking it as a good omen for the future, or because he found in his source the two things, the cure and the parabolic speech, recorded together as incidents of the same meeting in the synagogue. In either case it is implied that the parables were spoken in a synagogue, in the latter case as a part of a regular synagogue address. This is the interesting feature in Lk.’s report of these parables. It is the only instance in which parables are connected with synagogue addresses as their occasion. The connection is every way credible, both from the nature of the two parables, and from the fact that Jesus was wont to speak to the people in parables.

This discomfiture of the hypocrites, and the honest joy of the simple folk over a noble and Divine deed of mercy, accompanied by brave, kind words, seem to have suggested to the Master the subject of the two little parables of the mustard seed and the leaven, in which parables the growth of his glorious kingdom was foreshadowed from very small beginnings. The very small beginning he could discern in what then surrounded him. </body></html>
