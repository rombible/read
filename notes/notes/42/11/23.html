The heart of every unconverted sinner is the devil's palace, where he dwells, and where he rules. There is a kind of peace in the heart of an unconverted soul, while the devil, as a strong man armed, keeps it. The sinner is secure, has no doubt concerning the goodness of his state, nor any dread of the judgment to come. But observe the wonderful change made in conversion. The conversion of a soul to God, is Christ's victory over the devil and his power in that soul, restoring the soul to its liberty, and recovering his own interest in it and power over it. All the endowments of mind of body are now employed for Christ. Here is the condition of a hypocrite. The house is swept from common sins, by a forced confession, as Pharaoh's; by a feigned contrition, as Ahab's; or by a partial reformation, as Herod's. The house is swept, but it is not washed; the heart is not made holy. Sweeping takes off only the loose dirt, while the sin that besets the sinner, the beloved sin, is untouched. The house is garnished with common gifts and graces. It is not furnished with any true grace; it is all paint and varnish, not real nor lasting. It was never given up to Christ, nor dwelt in by the Spirit. Let us take heed of resting in that which a man may have, and yet come short of heaven. The wicked spirits enter in without any difficulty; they are welcomed, and they dwell there; there they work, there they rule. From such an awful state let all earnestly pray to be delivered.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. gathereth &#8230; scattereth&#8212;referring probably to gleaners.

Our Lord does not mean one, that was not personally with him; for there might be some, and doubtless were many, who were not in person with him, and yet were not against him, but friends to him, and to his interest; nor one that was not a professed disciple of his, or not a follower of him, and his apostles; for there were some who called themselves John's disciples, and did not attend on Christ, and yet were not against him, but cast out devils in his name; and such an one perhaps was he, that is made mention of in <a href="/mark/9-38.htm">Mark 9:38</a> on occasion of whom, Christ there says some words, which may seem at first view, not so well to accord with these: but such are intended, who acted a neutral part between him and the Pharisees; who could bear to hear them accuse him of casting out devils by the prince of devils, and be easy at it: and such persons are condemned, who can hear all manner of blasphemy against the deity, sonship, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of Christ, and express no indignation at it; these, as they cannot be said to be with Christ, may be truly ranked among those that are against him: <p>and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth; whoever did not encourage persons to attend on the ministry of Christ, which was confirmed by such miracles the Pharisees spoke so reproachfully and contemptuously of, were reckoned by Christ as such, who were the means of hindering persons gathering unto him; as well as those who menaced and excommunicated them for so doing: the allusion is either to the gathering of the sheep into the fold, and the scattering of them by the wolf; or to the gathering of the wheat, and binding it in sheaves, and bringing it home in harvest; and to the scattering of the wheat loose in the field, whereby it is lost, and comes to nothing; See Gill on <a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.</span><p>(5) Against indifferent men, and such as love to have a compromise, who seek means to reconcile Christ and Satan together.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/luke/11-23.htm" title="He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathers not with me scatters.">Luke 11:23</a>.

Our Lord here is referring to the exorcists, and contrasting <span class="accented">their</span> imperfect work with <span class="accented">his</span>, showing how hopeless a task it was to attempt to combat the evil one and his satellites apart from him - Christ. It is particularly to be noticed that Jesus neither here nor elsewhere charges these with imposture. Pretence and ridiculous spells and incantations were doubtless constantly mixed up with their attempts to exorcise; indeed, the term used to describe them in <a href="/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a> is one of contempt; but Jesus assumes in his argument here, what was no doubt the fact, that in these cases there was often, in the person of the physician-exorcist, earnestness and prayer mingled with the deepest pity for the unhappy sufferer, and before these there is no doubt that, in the less severe cases of possession, the evil influence or spirit yielded, and for a time at least let go his victim. "See," said the Master, "he that is not with me is against me in this dire conflict against evil;" for these would-be exorcists were utterly unable, even in those instances where they expelled the devil, to render him powerless to do mischief for the future. "<span class="accented">My</span> power sent these dread beings to the abyss, there to wait. The would-be exorcists were unable to replace the hellish tenant which they expelled by another and a holier influence. <span class="accented">I</span> bring back the once-tormented soul to its old relations with its God-Friend, and replace the unclean spirit by the Holy Spirit."
