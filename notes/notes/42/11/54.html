When any wait to catch something out of our mouths, that they may insnare us, O Lord, give us thy prudence and thy patience, and disappoint their evil purposes.

That faithful reproofs must be expected to excite opposition and hatred. Though the "conscience" may be roused, and may testify against the man that is reproved, yet that does not prevent his hating the reproof and the reprover.<p>2. We see here the manner in which wicked people endeavor to escape the reproofs of conscience. Instead of repenting, they seek vengeance, and resolve to put the reprover to shame or to death.<p>3. We see the exceeding malignity which people have against the Lord Jesus. Well was it said that he was set for the fall of many in Israel, that thereby the thoughts of many hearts might be revealed! <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34-35</a>. Men, now, are not by nature less opposed to Jesus than they were then.<p>4. We see the wisdom, purity, and firmness of the Saviour. To their souls he had been faithful. He had boldly reproved them for their sins. They sought his life. Multitudes of the artful and learned gathered around him, to endeavor to draw out something of which they might accuse him, yet in vain. Not a word fell from his lips of which they could accuse him. Everything that he said was calm, mild, peaceful, wise, and lovely. Even his cunning and bitter adversaries were always confounded, and retired in shame and confusion. Here, surely, must have been something more than man. None but "God manifest in the flesh" could have known all their designs, seen all their wickedness and their wiles, and escaped the cunning stratagems that were laid to confound and entangle him in his conversation.<p>5. The same infinitely wise Saviour can still meet and confound all his own enemies and those of his people, and deliver all his followers, as he did himself, from all the snares laid by a wicked world to lead them to sin and death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>53, 54.
