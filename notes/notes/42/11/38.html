They never ate, therefore, without such washing. The origin of the custom of washing with so much formality "before" they partook of their meals was that they did not use, as we do, knives and forks, but used their hands only. Hence, as their hands would be often in a dish on the table, it was esteemed proper that they should be washed clean before eating. Nor was their impropriety in the thing itself, but the Pharisees made it a matter of ceremony; they placed no small part of their religion in such ceremonies; and it was right, therefore, that our Lord should take occasion to reprove them for it.

That Christ laid himself down on one of the couches and began to eat: <p>he marvelled; that so great a prophet as he was, and a man of so much religion and holiness, should show no regard to a common custom with them, and which was one of the traditions of their elders, and which they put upon a level with the commands of God. The Vulgate Latin version, and so Beza's most ancient copy, and another exemplar, read, "he began to say, thinking" (or judging) "within himself": he was "moved" at it, as the Persic version renders it; he was filled with astonishment and indignation, <p>that he had not first washed before dinner; especially since he had been in a crowd of people, <a href="/luke/11-29.htm">Luke 11:29</a> for the Pharisees not only washed their hands, by immersing them up to the elbow before eating; but when they had been at market, or among any large number of people, or had reason to think they had, or feared they had touched any unclean person or thing, they immersed themselves all over in water: and which is the sense of the word  here used; See Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/7-2.htm">Mark 7:2</a>, <a href="/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3</a> and See Gill on <a href="/mark/7-4.htm">Mark 7:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/luke/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/luke/11-38.htm" title="And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner....">Luke 11:38-39</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐβαπτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρὸ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρίστ</span>.] See on <a href="/mark/7-2.htm" title="And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault.">Mark 7:2</a>.[146] Luke does not say that the Pharisee <span class="ital">expressed</span> his surprise; Jesus recognises his thoughts immediately. Comp. Augustine. Schleiermacher, p. 180 f., directly contradicts the narrative when he places these sayings of Jesus <span class="ital">after the meal</span>, saying that they were first spoken <span class="ital">outside the house</span>. See, on the other hand, Strauss, I. p. 654, who, however, likewise takes objection to their supposed <span class="ital">awkwardness</span> (comp. Gfrörer, <span class="ital">Heil. Sage</span>, I. p. 243, de Wette, Ritschl, Holtzmann, Eichthal). This judgment applies an inappropriate standard to the special relation in which Jesus stood to the Pharisees, seeing that when confronting them He felt a higher destiny than the maintenance of the respect due to a host moving Him (comp. <a href="/luke/7-39.htm" title="Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him: for she is a sinner.">Luke 7:39</a> ff.); and hence the perception of the fitness of things which guided the tradition to connecting <span class="ital">these</span> sayings with a <span class="ital">meal</span> was not <span class="ital">in itself</span> erroneous, although, if we follow Matthew 23, we must conclude that this connection was first made at a later date. Apart from this, however, the connection is quite capable of being explained, not, perhaps, from the mention of cups and platters, but <span class="ital">from the circumstance</span> that Jesus several times when occasion offered, and possibly about that period when He was a guest in the houses of Pharisees, gave vent to His righteous moral indignation in His anti-Pharisaic sayings. Comp. <a href="/luke/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.">Luke 14:1</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>] a silent contrast with a better <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΑΙ</span></span></span>: as it <span class="ital">now</span> stands with you, as far as things have gone with you, etc. Comp.

But the secondary character of Lk.’s narrative appears from this, that the ensuing discourse does not, as in Mt. and Mk., keep to the point in hand—neglect of ritual ablutions, but expatiates on Pharisaic vices generally.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>. <span class="ital">he marvelled that he had not first washed</span>] Literally, “<span class="ital">bathed.” </span>No washing was necessary to eat a few dates or figs. At the chief meal of the day, where all dipped their hands into a common dish, it was a matter of cleanliness. But the duty of cleanliness had been turned by the Oral Law into a rigorous set of cumbersome and needless ablutions, each performed with certain elaborate methods and gesticulations (<a href="/context/mark/7-2.htm" title="And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault....">Mark 7:2-3</a>) which had nothing to do with religion or even with the Levitical Law, but only with Pharisaic tradition and the Oral Law. In the <span class="ital">Shulchan Aruk,</span> a book of Jewish Ritual, no less than twenty-six prayers are given with which their washings are accompanied. But all this was not only devoid of divine sanction, but had become superstitious, tyrannous, and futile. The Pharisee ‘marvelled’ because he and his party tried to enforce the Oral Law on the people as even more sacred than the Written Law. The subject of ablutions was one which caused several of these disputes with Christ, <a href="/context/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:...">Matthew 15:19-20</a>. The Rabbi Akhibha would have preferred to die of thirst rather than neglect his ablutions, and the Talmud thought that a demon—called Schibta— sat on unwashen hands. Our Lord astonished the conventionalism of these religious teachers and their followers by shewing that what truly defiles a man is that which cometh <span class="ital">from within</span>—from the heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/11-38.htm" title="And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner.">Luke 11:38</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰδὼν</span>, <span class="ital">having seen</span>) that He had lain down [sat down].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner</span>. An elaborate system of utter meaningless ablutions, each carried out with particular gestures, had been instituted by the rabbinical schools. All these senseless forms and ceremonies had been developed out of the original  simple directions to secure cleanliness in the Levitical Law. It is probable that our Lord, intending to bring about this discussion. pointedly abstained from even the ordinary ablution on this occasion. The language of ver. 37 seems to point to his entering the house and at once sitting down at the table. The Talmud has many references to these practices. R. Akhibha, it proudly relates, died of thirst rather than pass over these preliminary washings. In the same compilation we read that it was currently supposed that a demon sat on hands unwashed. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Washed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>See on <a href="/mark/7-4.htm">Mark 7:4</a>. </body></html>
