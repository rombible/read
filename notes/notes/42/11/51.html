The words “the son of Barachiah,” in <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>, are probably an erroneous gloss which has crept from the margin into the text. The murdered Zacharias was the son of the High Priest Jehoiada; the Prophet Zechariah was a son of Barachiah, but died, so far as we know, a natural death; and the Zechariah son of Barachiah, who was murdered by the Zealots, did not die till forty years later than this time. The allusions are all the more striking from the direct references to retribution in these two instances, and from the fact that they are drawn from the first and last historical books of the O. T. (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm" title="And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-22.htm" title="Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son.

The reason, probably, why these two are selected out of the long red list of the noble army, must be sought for in the special position which the recital of these two deaths occupies in the Jewish canon of Scripture; the death of Abel being related in Genesis, the first book of the canon, that of Zacharias in the Second Book of Chronicles, which occupies the last place in the sacred volume (is the Jewish canon). They were simply two martyrdoms of illustrious men at the beginning and at the close of the long many-coloured story of the chosen race. There is no doubt that the Zacharias here alluded to was Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the high priest - a prophet and preacher of righteousness, who at the commandment of the king was stoned in the court of the house of the Lord. This is related in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>, in the same passage which was evidently in the Lord's mind when he pronounced the awful woe upon the generation then living. This martyrdom of Zacharias was to his Jewish listeners a very familiar and painful memory. It evidently ranked among the most terrible crimes committed by their fathers, and was the subject of some wild strange legends in the Talmud. The martyr's blood would not dry up; it was still bubbling when Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans took the temple. No sacrifices availed to stop the awful flow. Tradition assigns one of the four great sepulchral monuments at the foot of Olivet, alluded to above, to the murdered Zacharias. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The altar and the temple<p>O&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, temple, lit., house, is equivalent to &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, sanctuary (Rev.), in <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>.
