The heart of every unconverted sinner is the devil's palace, where he dwells, and where he rules. There is a kind of peace in the heart of an unconverted soul, while the devil, as a strong man armed, keeps it. The sinner is secure, has no doubt concerning the goodness of his state, nor any dread of the judgment to come. But observe the wonderful change made in conversion. The conversion of a soul to God, is Christ's victory over the devil and his power in that soul, restoring the soul to its liberty, and recovering his own interest in it and power over it. All the endowments of mind of body are now employed for Christ. Here is the condition of a hypocrite. The house is swept from common sins, by a forced confession, as Pharaoh's; by a feigned contrition, as Ahab's; or by a partial reformation, as Herod's. The house is swept, but it is not washed; the heart is not made holy. Sweeping takes off only the loose dirt, while the sin that besets the sinner, the beloved sin, is untouched. The house is garnished with common gifts and graces. It is not furnished with any true grace; it is all paint and varnish, not real nor lasting. It was never given up to Christ, nor dwelt in by the Spirit. Let us take heed of resting in that which a man may have, and yet come short of heaven. The wicked spirits enter in without any difficulty; they are welcomed, and they dwell there; there they work, there they rule. From such an awful state let all earnestly pray to be delivered.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 11:14-36.

This is to be taken quite literally of the overthrow of towns, in which a building tumbling into ruins strikes on the one adjoining it, and falls upon it. Thus rightly Vulgate, Luther, Erasmus, and others, Bleek also. Comp. Thucyd. ii. 84. 2 : <span class="greekheb">ναῦς τε νηῒ προσέπιπτε</span>. This meaning, inasmuch as it is still more strongly descriptive, is to be preferred to the view of Buttmann, which in itself is equally correct (<span class="ital">Neut. Gr</span>. p. 291 [E. T. 338]): <span class="ital">House after house</span>. Many other commentators take <span class="greekheb">οἶκος</span> as meaning <span class="ital">family</span>, and explain <span class="ital">either</span> (Bornemann), “<span class="ital">and one family falls away after another</span>” (on <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, comp. <a href="/philippians/2-27.htm" title="For indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow on sorrow.">Php 2:27</a>), <span class="ital">or</span> (so the greater number, Euthymius Zigabenus, Beza, Grotius, Valckenaer, Kuinoel, Paulus, de Wette) they supply <span class="greekheb">διαμερισθείς</span> after <span class="greekheb">οἶκον</span>, and take <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ οἶκον</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ἑαυτόν</span>: “et familia a se ipsa dissidens salva esse nequit” (Kuinoel). It may be argued against the latter view, that if the meaning expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ἑαυτόν</span> had been intended, the very parallelism of the passage would have required <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ἑαυτόν</span> to be <span class="ital">inserted</span>, and that <span class="greekheb">οἶκος ἐπὶ οἶκον</span> could not in any wise express this reflexive meaning, but could only signify: <span class="ital">one house against the other</span>. The whole explanation is the work of the Harmonists. It may be argued against Bornemann, that after <span class="greekheb">ἐρημοῦται</span> the thought which his interpretation brings out is much too weak, and consequently is not sufficiently in accordance with the context.

Of this we have clear evidence in the Gospel narratives. Puzzled and dismayed by the marvellous acts of power worked by Jesus, it was only too easy to say that he had friends and helpers among these spirits of evil which the Jew knew well were working unseen on earth. The circumstances under which the accusation was made, and the reply of the Lord spoken, were as follows: The scene is still in the provinces, the time somewhere in the period between October and the spring of the last Passover the period which the Master spent in that slow solemn progress, through as yet unvisited places, towards Jerusalem. Learned and experienced members of the Pharisee party, scribes and doctors of the Law, had been told off to watch the dangerous and popular Galilaean Teacher, and, whenever it was possible, to lessen his influence among the people. Jesus (ver. 14) had been occupied in one of his (probably) daily works of healing. He had expelled an evil spirit from a sufferer whose malady had assumed the grave form of insanity which refused to speak. The people around were wondering at this gracious act of power; then broke in voices of accusation, voices to challenge him to show them some sign from heaven, saying that his power was only derived from evil sources. To this the Master replies with consummate skill, knowing the trained minds with whom just then he had to do. He is interrupted by murmurs of approval from the crowd (vers. 27, 28). He notices these for a me-merit, and then proceeds in detail to reply to that subtle request that he would prove his claims by showing them some sign from heaven. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb</span>. Some very terrible and apparently helpless form of possession which manifested itself in a mute, possibly in a motionless, melancholy insanity. And the people wondered.
