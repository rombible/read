A charming little incident and profoundly instructive. With true womanly feeling, she envies the mother of such a wonderful Teacher. Well, and higher and better than she had said as much before her (Lu 1:28, 42); and our Lord is far from condemning it. He only holds up&#8212;as "blessed rather"&#8212;the hearers and keepers of God's word; in other words, the humblest real saint of God. (See on [1637]Mt 12:49, 50.) How utterly alien is this sentiment from the teaching of the Church of Rome, which would excommunicate any one of its members who dared to talk in the spirit of this glorious saying!

Christ said "to the woman", Persic version reads, as correcting her, though not denying it, nor reproving her for it, but improving upon it: <p>yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it; intimating, that though his mother was happy in bearing and suckling such a son, yet it was a far greater happiness to hear the word of God; meaning either himself, the eternal "Logos", so as to embrace him, believe on him, and have him formed in the heart; or the Gospel preached by him, so as to understand it, receive it as the ingrafted word, and bring forth fruit, and act in obedience to it, observe it, and abide by it, and never relinquish it. This is a greater happiness than to be related to Christ in the flesh, though ever so nearly. The Ethiopic version reads, "that hear the word of God, and believe, and keep it": for faith comes by hearing, and shows itself in doing. Barely to hear the word, and even give an assent to it, will be of little avail, unless what is heard and believed is put in practice. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/11-28.htm" title="But he said, Yes rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.">Luke 11:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">μενοῦν</span> might be confirmatory (<span class="ital">utique</span>) or corrective (<span class="ital">imo vero</span>), or a little of both; the tone of voice would show which of the two the speaker meant to be the more prominent.
