Here also it seems, on the whole, more probable that we have a portion of our Lord’s previous teaching repeated by Him in almost identical terms, than that a fragment of that teaching has either been torn from its proper context by St. Luke, or artificially woven into a discourse to which it did not belong by St. Matthew.

But though Christ himself were the constant preacher in any congregation, and worked miracles daily among them, yet unless his grace humbled their hearts, they would not profit by his word. Let us not desire more evidence and fuller teaching than the Lord is pleased to afford us. We should pray without ceasing that our hearts and understandings may be opened, that we may profit by the light we enjoy. And especially take heed that the light which is in us be not darkness; for if our leading principles be wrong, our judgment and practice must become more so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses are found in Matthew, but in a different connection.

It was a kind of proverbial speech, and so applicable to divers subjects. Some think that our Saviour bringeth in these words as a reason why he would show the Pharisees no sign, viz. because he knew it would do them no good, it had been like the lighting of a candle and putting it under a bushel, which no man doth. Others think that by it he designs to give an account why he pronounced those blessed who heard the word and did it, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/11-28.htm" title="But he said, Yes rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.">Luke 11:28</a></span>, because practice, and giving light to others, is the end of all hearing. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>No man when he hath lighted a candle,....
