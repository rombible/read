Those who would see Christ must go to his temple. Here is a confession of his faith, that this Child in his arms was the Saviour, the salvation itself, the salvation of God's appointing. He bids farewell to this world. How poor does this world look to one that has Christ in his arms, and salvation in his view! See here, how comfortable is the death of a good man; he departs in peace with God, peace with his own conscience, in peace with death. Those that have welcomed Christ, may welcome death. Joseph and Mary marvelled at the things which were spoken of this Child. Simeon shows them likewise, what reason they had to rejoice with trembling. And Jesus, his doctrine, and people, are still spoken against; his truth and holiness are still denied and blasphemed; his preached word is still the touchstone of men's characters. The secret good affections in the minds of some, will be revealed by their embracing Christ; the secret corruptions of others will be revealed by their enmity to Christ. Men will be judged by the thoughts of their hearts concerning Christ. He shall be a suffering Jesus; his mother shall suffer with him, because of the nearness of her relation and affection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A light to lighten the Gentiles - This is in accordance with the prophecies in the Old Testament, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>; <a href="/psalms/98-3.htm">Psalm 98:3</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>. The Gentiles are represented as sitting in darkness that is, in ignorance and sin. Christ is a "light" to them, as by him they will be made acquainted with the character of the true God, his law, and the plan of redemption. As the darkness rolls away when the sun arises, so ignorance and error flee away when Jesus gives light to the mind. Nations shall come to his light, and kings to the brightness of his rising, <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>.<p>And the glory ... - The first offer of salvation was made to the Jews, <a href="/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>. Jesus was born among the Jews; to them had been given the prophecies respecting him, and his first ministry was among them. Hence, he was their glory, their honor, their light. But it is a subject of special gratitude to us that the Saviour was given also for the Gentiles; for:<p>1. We are Gentiles, and if he had not come we should have been shut out from the blessings of redemption.<p>2. It is he only that now.<p>"Can make our dying bed.<p>Feel soft as downy pillows are,<p>While on his breast we lean our head,<p>And breathe our life out sweetly there."<p>Thus our departure may be like that of Simeon. Thus we may die in peace. Thus it will be a blessing to die. But,<p>3. In order to do this, our life must be like that of Simeon. We must wait for the consolation of Israel. We must look for his coming. We must be holy, harmless, undefiled, "loving" the Saviour. Then death to us, like death to Simeon, will have no terror; we shall depart in peace, and in heaven see the salvation of God, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-11.htm">2 Peter 3:11-12</a>. But,<p>4. Children, as well as the hoary-headed Simeon, may look for the coming of Christ.

According to biblical usage the term is understood of people who are not of Israel, and who therefore occupy a different position with reference to the plan of salvation. Hence the extension of the gospel salvation to them is treated as a remarkable fact. See <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-21.htm">Matthew 12:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="/acts/10-45.htm">Acts 10:45</a>; <a href="/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>; <a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>. Paul is called distinctively an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles, and a chosen vessel to bear Christ's name among them. In <a href="/acts/15-9.htm">Acts 15:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>, we see this difference annihilated, and the expression at last is merely historical designation of the non-Israelitish nations which, as such, were formerly without God and salvation. See <a href="/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23</a>; <a href="/romans/16-4.htm">Romans 16:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>. Sometimes the word is used in a purely moral sense, to denote the heathen in opposition to Christians.

Compare <a href="/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>. Israel, however, has already received light by the revelation of God through the law and the prophets, and that light will expand into glory through Christ. Through the Messiah, Israel will attain its true and highest glory. </body></html>
