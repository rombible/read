We find a woman recognised as a prophetess at a time when no man is recognised as a prophet. She bears the name of the mother of the founder of the School of the Prophets, identical with that which the legends of Apocryphal Gospels assign to the mother of the Virgin. She is named, as if it were a well-known fact, as having been the wife of Phanuel, and she is not of the tribe of Judah, but of Aser. That tribe, then, though belonging to the Ten that had been carried into exile by Shalmaneser (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>), had not been altogether lost. Some, at least, of its members survived and cherished the genealogies of their descent, as one family of the neighbouring tribe of Naphthali are said to have done at Nineveh (<a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/1-2.htm" title="Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.">Tobit 1:2</a>). In that family also we find the name of Anna (<a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/1-9.htm" title="Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat Tobias.">Tobit 1:9</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Seven years from her virginity.</span>—The words are emphasised (1) as expressing chastity prior to marriage, and (2) as excluding the thought of a second marriage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;...">Luke 2:36-38</a>. </span><span class="ital">And there was one Anna, a prophetess </span>— A person of some note; <span class="ital">she was a widow of about fourscore and four years </span>— These were the years of her life, and not of her widowhood only; <span class="ital">who departed not from the temple </span>— The meaning is, not that she abode continually in the temple: for none lived there save the priests and Levites; but she attended there constantly at all the stated hours of prayer. <span class="ital">But served God with fastings and prayers </span>— Even at that advanced age; <span class="ital">night and day </span>— That is, spending therein a considerable part of the night, as well as of the day. <span class="ital">She coming in at that instant </span>— The providence of God so ordering it, that another important testimony might be borne to the child Jesus; <span class="ital">gave thanks likewise unto the Lord — </span>Praised the Lord, as Simeon had done, for sending the long-expected Messiah: or, <span class="ital">in her turn confessed to the Lord, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ανθωμολογειτο τω Κυριω</span>, properly signifies. The expression seems to have a reference to Simeon’s speech, and might be intended to intimate that this of Anna was a kind of response, or counterpart to his. <span class="ital">And spake of him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem </span>— She spake afterward of the child, under the character of the Messiah, to all her acquaintance at Jerusalem, that had any sense of religion, or faith in its promises. The sceptre now appeared to be <span class="ital">departing from Judah, </span>though it was not actually gone: Daniel’s weeks were plainly near their period. And the revival of the spirit of prophecy, together with the memorable occurrences relating to the birth of John the Baptist, and of Jesus, could not but encourage and quicken the expectation of pious persons at this time. Ought not the example of these aged saints to impress and animate those, whose <span class="ital">hoary heads, </span>like theirs, are a <span class="ital">crown of glory, being found in the way of righteousness? </span>Should not those venerable lips, so soon to be silent in the grave, be employed in the praises of their Redeemer, that they may have the pleasure to see, through their pious attempts, the rising generation improve in true religion? and that they may quit the world with the greater tranquillity, in the view of leaving those behind them, to whom Christ will be as precious as he hath been to them, and who will be waiting for God’s salvation when they are gone to enjoy it?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:36-40 There was much evil then in the church, yet God left not himself without witness. Anna always dwelt in, or at least attended at, the temple. She was always in a praying spirit; gave herself to prayer, and in all things she served God. Those to whom Christ is made known, have great reason to thank the Lord. She taught others concerning him. Let the example of the venerable saints, Simeon and Anna, give courage to those whose hoary heads are, like theirs, a crown of glory, being found in the way of righteousness. The lips soon to be silent in the grave, should be showing forth the praises of the Redeemer. In all things it became Christ to be made like unto his brethren, therefore he passed through infancy and childhood as other children, yet without sin, and with manifest proofs of the Divine nature in him. By the Spirit of God all his faculties performed their offices in a manner not seen in any one else. Other children have foolishness bound in their hearts, which appears in what they say or do, but he was filled with wisdom, by the influence of the Holy Ghost; every thing he said and did, was wisely said and wisely done, above his years. Other children show the corruption of their nature; nothing but the grace of God was upon him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of the tribe of Aser - The tribe of Aser, or Asher, dwelt in the northern part of the land of Canaan.

God took care that our Saviour’s nativity should be fully attested. To the testimony of the angels, the wise men, the shepherds, Simeon, here is added another. It is that of Anna, who is described here by her tribe and by her father. She was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">of the tribe of Aser, </span> one of the meanest tribes, and of those ten tribes that were carried into the captivity of Assyria, having before made a defection (under the conduct of Jeroboam) both from the house of David and from the true worship of God. But though the generality did so, yet many particular persons removed, to enjoy the true worship of God, and joined themselves to Judith. <span class="bld"><a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Jeremiah 1:4</a></span>, it was prophesied, <span class="ital">that the children of Israel should come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping, to seek the Lord their God.</span> What her father <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Phanuel</span> was we read not. She is also further said to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a prophetess.</span> Such there were amongst the Jews; we read of Deborah, and Miriam, and Huldah, to whom king Josiah sent. They were called prophets and prophetesses who revealed the will of God unto the people; but in the Old Testament it most generally signified, such as God enabled to foretell things which were to come. The spirit of prophecy had much failed amongst the Jews for four hundred years before Christ; about Christ’s coming it began to revive. This woman seems to have been upwards of a hundred years old, if we account the eighty-four years here mentioned from her widowhood; not so, if we count them from her birth. She was but seven years married, all the rest of her life she had spent in widowhood. She <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">departed not from the temple night or day; </span> that is, she was frequently there, giving up herself wholly to religious exercises, prayer, and fasting, that she might be more fit for prayer. This woman <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">coming in at that instant</span> where Simeon took up Christ in his arms, &c., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to</span> such as she knew in Jerusalem, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">who looked for the redemption</span> of Israel. There is no place where God hath had a name, but, however it be corrupted and debauched, hath a number that keep close to God. God in Ahab’s time had seven thousand in Israel; and in this most corrupt time there was a Simeon and an Anna, and also others, who had a true notion and expectation of the Messiah; and these the Holy Ghost taketh more notice of than of all the Jewish doctors, all the scribes and Pharisees, whose names are enrolled, while what these persons said and did shall remain for a memorial of them wherever the gospel shall be preached to the end of the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there was one Anna,.... The name is the same with Hannah: so Hannah, the mother of Samuel, is by the Septuagint called Anna, in <a href="/1_samuel/1-2.htm">1 Samuel 1:2</a> and it signifies "grace"; or "gracious": and as was her name, so was she, a gracious woman; One that had the grace of God herself, and was a publisher of the glad tidings of grace and redemption by Christ, to others; and she was <p>a prophetess: for though prophecy had ceased among the Jews for some hundreds of years, it now revived upon the coming of the Messiah; and though instances of women prophets were rare, yet some there were, both before, and after the coming of Christ; as Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth, and Huldah, the wife of Shallum; and this Anna, at the time of Christ's birth, and afterwards four daughters of Philip the Evangelist, who were virgins. This woman was <p>the daughter of Phanuel; it is the same name with Penuel; and which, by the Septuagint, in <a href="/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a> is called Phanuel, as here. This man might be a person of some note, or he may be mentioned for the sake of his name, which signifies the face of God, and is the name Jacob gave to a certain place where he had seen God face to face, <a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>. And now Phanuel's daughter both saw and gave the light of the knowledge of God, in the face of Jesus Christ, and now beheld his face in the flesh, who is God over all, blessed for ever, <p>Of the tribe of Aser; the same with Asher; for so Asher is called, as here, by the Septuagint, in <a href="/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a> and elsewhere: and though this tribe was carried captive with the rest of the ten tribes; yet there were some of the ten tribes that returned along with Judah and Benjamin, and were dispersed among them. This tribe had its seat in Galilee; so that though the Jews denied that any prophet came from thence, yet it seems a prophetess did, <p>She was of a great age: the phrase is the same with that in <a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7</a> there rendered, "stricken in years"; See Gill on <a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7</a>. Her age will appear to be great, if it be observed, that she was seven years a married woman, and fourscore and four years a widow, which make ninety one; and if she was married at twelve years and a half, at which time the Jews (o) reckoned females marriageable, she must be an hundred and three years old; and perhaps her age might be eight or ten years more: <p>and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity: this is mentioned to observe her chastity, that she was in her virginity, or a chaste virgin, when she became a wife; such an one as the high priest was obliged to have, <a href="/leviticus/21-13.htm">Leviticus 21:13</a> and that the tokens of her virginity were brought, which the Jewish laws obliged to, <a href="/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a> and that she lived honestly, and honourably, with her husband, during the term of her marriage state, <p>(o) Maimon.
