they shall be for dung on the face of the earth.">Jeremiah 8:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm" title="And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.">Jeremiah 19:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-3.htm" title="For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.">2Chronicles 33:3</a>). In this sense we find it in St. Stephen’s speech (<a href="/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a>). Here it is obviously used of the angels of God as forming the armies of the great King. The great name of the Lord of Hosts, the Lord of Sabaoth, was probably intended to include both the seen and the unseen hosts, the stars in the firmament, and the angels in heaven. Its use in the New Testament is confined to these two passages. The Hebrew word is found, in Old Testament quotations, in <a href="/romans/9-29.htm" title="And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like to Gomorrha.">Romans 9:29</a>, <a href="/james/5-4.htm" title="Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.">James 5:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/luke/2-13.htm" title="And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,...">Luke 2:13-14</a>. </span><span class="ital">And suddenly there was with the angel, </span>&c. — The welcome news was no sooner published, than a multitude of heavenly beings were heard celebrating, in songs and hymns divine, the praises of God, on account of his unspeakable mercy and love to men; <span class="ital">and saying, Glory to God in the highest, </span>&c. — The shouts of a multitude are generally broken into short sentences, and are commonly elliptic; which is the cause of some ambiguity in these words, which may be understood in different senses. Some read them thus: <span class="ital">Glory to God in the highest, </span>that is, in heaven, <span class="ital">and on earth peace, yea, favour, toward men. </span>Others understand them as signifying, That the <span class="ital">good-will, </span>or favour, which was now shown to men, is the <span class="ital">Glory of God in the highest, </span>and is the <span class="ital">peace </span>and happiness of those who dwell on earth. This is doubtless an important sense, and what the original will very well bear, but it changes the doxology into a kind of proverb, and destroys much of its beauty. As Dr. Campbell observes; “The most common interpretation of the passage is the most probable.” The words are doubtless to be considered as expressions of rejoicing exclamation, strongly representing the piety and benevolence of these heavenly spirits, and their affectionate good wishes for the prosperity of the Messiah’s kingdom; as if they had said, “Glory be to God in the highest heavens, and let all the angelic legions resound his praises in the most exalted strains, for, with the Redeemer’s birth, <span class="ital">peace </span>and all happiness come down to dwell on earth; yea, the overflowings of divine benevolence and favour are now exercised toward sinful men, who through this Saviour become the objects of his complacential delight.” The words, considered in a doctrinal point of view, teach us, what it is of great importance to know, 1st, That the birth of Christ is an event which, above all others, brings glory to God, giving such a display of several of his perfections as had never been made before, particularly of his <span class="ital">holiness </span>and <span class="ital">justice, </span>in requiring such a sacrifice as was hereby to be prepared for the expiation of human guilt, and his <span class="ital">mercy, </span>in providing and accepting it; his <span class="ital">wisdom, </span>in devising such a plan for the redemption of lost man, and his <span class="ital">power, </span>in executing it. 2d, It brings <span class="ital">peace on earth, </span>that is, peace to man, peace with God, through the atonement and mediation of Christ; peace of conscience, as the consequence of knowing that we have peace with God, and peace one with another. 3d, It displays the <span class="ital">good-will, </span>the benevolence, the love of God to man, as no other of his works or dispensations ever did, or could do. See <a href="/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>, &c.; <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-20 Angels were heralds of the new-born Saviour, but they were only sent to some poor, humble, pious, industrious shepherds, who were in the business of their calling, keeping watch over their flock. We are not out of the way of Divine visits, when we are employed in an honest calling, and abide with God in it. Let God have the honour of this work; Glory to God in the highest. God's good-will to men, manifested in sending the Messiah, redounds to his praise. Other works of God are for his glory, but the redemption of the world is for his glory in the highest. God's goodwill in sending the Messiah, brought peace into this lower world. Peace is here put for all that good which flows to us from Christ's taking our nature upon him. This is a faithful saying, attested by an innumerable company of angels, and well worthy of all acceptation, That the good-will of God toward men, is glory to God in the highest, and peace on the earth. The shepherds lost no time, but came with haste to the place. They were satisfied, and made known abroad concerning this child, that he was the Saviour, even Christ the Lord. Mary carefully observed and thought upon all these things, which were so suited to enliven her holy affections. We should be more delivered from errors in judgment and practice, did we more fully ponder these things in our hearts. It is still proclaimed in our ears that to us is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.

Messias celebrabit in coelis Deum et in terram deducet pacem divinam, documentum</span> (in apposition) <span class="ital">benevolentiae divinae erga homines</span>.” But Luke himself specifies the contents as praise <span class="ital">of God</span> (<a href="/luke/2-13.htm" title="And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,">Luke 2:13</a>); and the assumption of Bornemann (after Paulus), that Luke has given only a small fragment of the hymn, is the more arbitrary, the more the few pregnant words are precisely in keeping with a heavenly song of praise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[50] Olshausen (following Alberti, <span class="ital">Obss.</span>, and Tittmann, <span class="ital">Diss.</span>, Viteb. 1777) places a stop after <span class="greekheb">γῆς</span>, so that the first clause says: “God is now praised as in heaven, so also in the earth.” This is erroneous, because, according to the order of the words in Luke, the emphatic point would be not <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ γῆς</span>, as in the Lord’s Prayer, but <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑψίστοις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[51] Nevertheless Ebrard (on Olshausen) still defends the <span class="ital">threefold division</span>. According to him, the angels exult (1) that <span class="ital">in heaven</span> honour is given to God for the redemption now brought about; (2) that <span class="ital">upon earth</span> a kingdom of peace is now founded; (3) that <span class="ital">between heaven and earth</span> the right relation is restored, that God’s eye may again rest with good pleasure on mankind. This alleged third clause of necessity contains somewhat of tautology; and the text itself by its <span class="greekheb">καί</span> and by its contrast of heaven and earth yields only <span class="ital">two</span> clauses. Lange also, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. 1, p. 103, understands it in a threefold sense, but very arbitrarily takes <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκία</span> of the divine good pleasure <span class="ital">manifested in a Person</span>, referring to passages such as <a href="/context/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,...">Ephesians 1:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">a multitude of the heavenly host</span>] The Sabaoth; <a href="/romans/9-29.htm" title="And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like to Gomorrha.">Romans 9:29</a>; <a href="/james/5-4.htm" title="Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.">James 5:4</a>. “Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him,” <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm" title="A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/5-11.htm" title="And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;...">Revelation 5:11-12</a>.

"The troop of angels issues forth from the depths of that invisible world which surrounds us on every side" (Godet). One of the glorious titles by which the eternal King was known among the chosen people was "Lord of sabaoth," equivalent to "Lord of hosts." In several passages of the Scriptures is the enormous multitude of these heavenly beings noticed; for instance, <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, where the Hebrew is much more expressive than the English rendering; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, "Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him" (see, too, the Targum of Palestine on <a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, "And with him ten thousand times ten thousand holy angels;" and "The crown of the Law is his [Moses'], because he brought it from the heavens above, when there was revealed to him the glory of the Lord's Shechinah, with two thousand myriads of angels, and forty and two thousand chariots of fire," etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A multitude of the heavenly host<p>Host (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) is literally army.
