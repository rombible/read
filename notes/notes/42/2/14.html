The idea implied in the words “in the highest” (the Greek is plural), is that the praise is heard in the very heaven of heavens, in the highest regions of the universe.<p><span class= "bld">On earth peace, good will toward men.</span>—The better MSS. give, “on earth peace among men of good will”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> among men who are the objects of the good will, the approval and love of God. The other construction, “Peace to men of peace,” which the <span class= "ital">Christian Year</span> has made familiar, is hardly consistent with the general usage of the New Testament as to the word rendered “good will.” The construction is the same as in “His dear Son,” literally, <span class= "ital">the Son of His Love,</span> in <a href="/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>. The word is one which both our Lord (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="/luke/10-21.htm" title="In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in your sight.">Luke 10:21</a>) and St. Paul use of the divine will in its aspect of benevolence, and the corresponding verb appears, as uttered by the divine voice, at the Baptism and Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>). The words stand in the Greek, as in the English, without a verb, and may therefore be understood either as a proclamation or a prayer. The “peace on earth” has not unfrequently been connected, as in Milton’s <span class= "ital">Ode on the Nativity,</span> with the fact that the Roman empire was then at peace, and the gates of the Temple of Janus closed because there was no need for the power of the god to go forth in defence of its armies. It is obvious, however, that the “peace” of the angels’ hymn is something far higher than any “such as the world giveth”—peace between man and God, and therefore peace within the souls of all who are thus reconciled. We may see a reference to the thought, possibly even to the words of the angelic song, in St. Paul’s way of speaking of Christ as being Himself “our peace (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-20 Angels were heralds of the new-born Saviour, but they were only sent to some poor, humble, pious, industrious shepherds, who were in the business of their calling, keeping watch over their flock. We are not out of the way of Divine visits, when we are employed in an honest calling, and abide with God in it. Let God have the honour of this work; Glory to God in the highest. God's good-will to men, manifested in sending the Messiah, redounds to his praise. Other works of God are for his glory, but the redemption of the world is for his glory in the highest. God's goodwill in sending the Messiah, brought peace into this lower world. Peace is here put for all that good which flows to us from Christ's taking our nature upon him. This is a faithful saying, attested by an innumerable company of angels, and well worthy of all acceptation, That the good-will of God toward men, is glory to God in the highest, and peace on the earth. The shepherds lost no time, but came with haste to the place. They were satisfied, and made known abroad concerning this child, that he was the Saviour, even Christ the Lord. Mary carefully observed and thought upon all these things, which were so suited to enliven her holy affections. We should be more delivered from errors in judgment and practice, did we more fully ponder these things in our hearts. It is still proclaimed in our ears that to us is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord. These should be glad tidings to all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Glory to God - Praise be to God, or honor be to God. That is, the praise of redeeming man is due to God. The plan of redemption will bring glory to God, and is designed to express his glory. This it does by evincing his love to people, his mercy, his condescension, and his regard to the honor of his law and the stability of his own government. It is the highest expression of his love and mercy. Nowhere, so far as we can see, could his glory be more strikingly exhibited than in giving his only-begotten Son to die for people.<p>In the highest - This is capable of several meanings:<p>1. In the highest "strains," or in the highest possible manner.<p>2. "Among" the highest that is, among the angels of God; indicating that "they" felt a deep interest in this work, and were called on to praise God for the redemption of man.<p>3. In the highest heavens - indicating that the praise of redemption should not be confined to the "earth," but should spread throughout the universe.<p>4. The words "God in the highest" may be equivalent to "the Most High God," and be the same as saying, "Let the most high God be praised for his love and mercy to people."<p>Which of these meanings is the true one it is difficult to determine; but in this they all agree, that high praise is to be given to God for his love in redeeming people. O that not only "angels," but "men," would join universally in this song of praise!<p>On earth peace - That is, the gospel will bring peace. The Saviour was predicted as the Prince of peace, <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>. The world is at war with God; sinners are at enmity against their Maker and against each other. There is no peace to the wicked. But Jesus came to make peace; and this he did,<p>1. By reconciling the world to God by His atonement.<p>2. By bringing the sinner to a state of peace with his Maker; inducing him to lay down the weapons of rebellion and to submit his soul to God, thus giving him the peace which passeth all understanding.<p>3. By diffusing in the heart universal good-will to people - "disposing," people to lay aside their differences, to love one another, to seek each other's welfare, and to banish envy, malice, pride, lust, passion, and covetousness - in all ages the most fruitful causes of difference among people. And,<p>4. By diffusing the principles of universal peace among nations. If the gospel of Jesus should universally prevail, there would be an end of war. In the days of the millennium there will be universal peace; all the causes of war will have ceased; people will love each other and do justly; all nations will be brought under the influence of the gospel. O how should each one toil and pray that the great object of the gospel should be universally accomplished, and the world be filled with peace!<p>Good will toward men - The gift of the Saviour is an expression of good-will or love to people, and therefore God is to be praised. The work of redemption is uniformly represented as the fruit of the love of God, <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>. No words can express the greatness of that love. It can only be measured by the "misery, helplessness," and "danger" of man; by the extent of his sufferings here and in the world of woe if he had not been saved; by the condescension, sufferings, and death of Jesus; and by the eternal honor and happiness to which he will raise his people. All these are beyond our full comprehension. Yet how little does man feel it! and how many turn away from the highest love of God, and treat the expression of that love with contempt! Surely, if God so loved us "first," we ought also to love him, <a href="/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Glory, &c.&#8212;brief but transporting hymn&#8212;not only in articulate human speech, for our benefit, but in tunable measure, in the form of a Hebrew parallelism of two complete clauses, and a third one only amplifying the second, and so without a connecting "and." The "glory to God," which the new-born "Saviour" was to bring, is the first note of this sublime hymn: to this answers, in the second clause, the "peace on earth," of which He was to be "the Prince" (Isa 9:6)&#8212;probably sung responsively by the celestial choir; while quickly follows the glad echo of this note, probably by a third detachment of the angelic choristers&#8212;"good will to men." "They say not, glory to God in heaven, where angels are, but, using a rare expression, "in the highest [heavens]," whither angels aspire not," (Heb 1:3, 4) [Bengel]. "Peace" with God is the grand necessity of a fallen world. To bring in this, and all other peace in its train, was the prime errand of the Saviour to this earth, and, along with it, Heaven's whole "good will to men"&#8212;the divine complacency on a new footing&#8212;descends to rest upon men, as upon the Son Himself, in whom God is "well-pleased." (Mt 3:17, the same word as here.)<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/2-13.htm" title="And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,">Luke 2:13</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Glory to God in the highest,.... Which with the following words, are not to be considered as a wish, that so it might be, but as an affirmation, that so it was; for the glory of God is great in the salvation, peace, and reconciliation of his people by Jesus Christ, even the glory of all his perfections; of his wisdom and prudence in forming such a scheme; of his love, grace, and, mercy, the glory of which is his main view, and is hereby answered; and of his holiness, which is hereby honoured; and of his justice, which is fully satisfied; and of his power in the accomplishment of it; and of his truth and faithfulness in fulfilling his covenant and oath, and all the promises and prophecies relating to it. Great glory from hence arises to God; who is in the highest heavens, and is given him by angels and saints that dwell there, and that in the highest strains; and by saints on earth too in, their measure, and as they are able: the ground and foundation of which is what follows: <p>and on earth peace: by which is meant, not external peace, though, at this time there was peace on earth all the world over; nor internal peace, as distinguished from that eternal peace which the saints enjoy in heaven; nor even peace made by Christ; for this, as yet, was not done on earth, but was to be made by the blood of his cross: rather Christ himself is here intended, who is called "the man, the peace" <a href="/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a> and "our peace", <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a> and was now on earth, being just born, in order to make peace with God, and reconciliation for the sins of the people: and he is so called, because he is the author of peace between Jew and Gentile, which were at enmity with each other; by abrogating the ceremonial law, the cause of that enmity; by sending the Gospel to them, and converting some of each; and by granting the like privileges to them both; see <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a> and because he is the author of peace between God and elect sinners, who, through the fall, are at enmity against, God, and enemies in their minds by wicked works unto him; nor can they make their peace with God; they know not the way of it; nor are they disposed to it; nor can they approach to God to treat with him about terms of peace; nor can they do those things that will make their peace with God, as satisfying his justice, and fulfilling his law: Christ only is their peace maker; he only is fit for it, being God and man in one person, and so a daysman that can lay his hands on both, and has a concern in each, in things pertaining to God, and to make reconciliation for the sins of the people: he only is able to do it, and he has done it by the blood of his cross; and a very excellent peace it is he has made: it is made upon the most honourable terms, to the satisfaction of justice, and the magnifying of the law of God; and is therefore a lasting one, and attended with many blessings, such as freedom of access to God, and a right to all the privileges of his house; and the news of it are glad tidings of good things: and those angels that first brought the tidings of it, may be truly called, as some of the angels are by the Jews (t),  "angels of peace". Moreover, Christ may be said to be "peace", because he is the donor of all true solid peace and real prosperity, both external, which his people have in the world, and with each other; and internal, which they have in their own breasts, through believing in him, and attending on his ordinances; and eternal, which they shall have for ever with him in the world to come. And now Christ being the peace on earth, is owing to <p>will towards men; that is, to the free favour, good will, and pleasure of God towards chosen men in Christ Jesus: that Christ was on earth as the peacemaker, or giver, was owing to God's good will; not to angels, for good angels needed him not as such; and the angels that sinned were not spared, nor was a Saviour provided for them; but to men, and not to all men; for though all men share in the providential goodness of God, yet not in his special good will, free grace, and favour: but to elect men, to whom a child was born, and a Son given, even the Prince of Peace: it was from God's good will to these persons, whom he loved with an everlasting love in Christ, laid up goodness for them in him, blessed them with all spiritual blessings in him, and made a covenant with him for them; that he provided and appointed his son to be the Saviour and peace maker; that he sent him into this world to be the propitiation for sin; and that he spared him not, but delivered him up into the hands of men, justice, and death, in order to make peace for them. The Vulgate Latin version, and some copies, as the Alexandrian, and Beza's most ancient one, read, "peace on earth to men of good will"; and which must be understood, not of men that have a good will of themselves, for there are no such men: no man has a will to that which is good, till God works in him both to will, and to do of his, good pleasure; wherefore peace, reconciliation, and salvation, are not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy: but of such who are the objects of God's good will, and pleasure, whom he loves, because he will love, and has mercy and compassion on them, and is gracious to them, because he will be so; and therefore chooses, redeems, and regenerates them of his own will, and because it seems good in his sight. The Syriac and Persic versions read, "good hope to men"; as there is a foundation laid in Christ the peace, of a good hope of reconciliation, righteousness, pardon, life, and salvation for sinful men. The Arabic version renders it, "cheerfulness in men"; as there is a great deal of reason for it, on account of the birth of the Saviour and peace maker, the salvation that comes by him to men, and the glory brought thereby to God, <p>(t) Zohar in Exod. fol. 8. 1. &amp; 98. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/luke/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> good will toward men.</span><p>(g) God's ready, good, infinite, and gracious favour towards men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>. <span class="ital">The angels’ song</span>.—If we regard the announcement of the angel to the shepherds (<a href="/context/luke/2-10.htm" title="And the angel said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people....">Luke 2:10-12</a>) as a song, then we may view the <span class="ital">gloria in excelsis</span> as a refrain sung by a celestial choir (<span class="greekheb">πλῆθος στρατιᾶς οὐρανίου</span>, <a href="/luke/2-13.htm" title="And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,">Luke 2:13</a>).

See this contrast magnificently shadowed forth in <a href="/context/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire....">Isaiah 9:5-6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Good will towards me</span><span class="ital">n</span>] The reading <span class="ital">eudokia</span>, ‘goodwill,’ is found in B, but <span class="greekheb">א</span>, A, D read <span class="ital">eudokias</span>, and if this be the right reading the meaning is “on earth peace <span class="bld">among men of good will</span>” (<span class="ital">hominibus bonae voluntatis</span>, Vulg.), i. e. those with whom God is well pleased. “The Lord taketh pleasure in them that hope in His mercy,” <a href="/psalms/147-11.htm" title="The LORD takes pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.">Psalm 147:11</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/12-32.htm" title="Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.">Luke 12:32</a>, “it is your Father’s <span class="ital">good pleasure</span> to give you the kingdom.” The construction “men of good will” would be rare in this sense, but the triple parallelism of the verse,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Glory<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;to God<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;in the highest<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peace<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;to men whom God loves<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&emsp;&emsp;on earth<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>seems to favour it. In either case the verse implies that “being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” <a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>. In any case the “<span class="ital">towards</span>” is wrong, and must be altered into “among” (<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Glory to God on high, on earth be peace,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And love towards men of love—salvation and release.”—Keble.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>. [13] <span class="greekheb">Λεγόντων</span>, <span class="ital">saying</span>) This whole hymn consists of two members, and has a doxology, or thanksgiving which in its turn consists of two members, and an Ætiology [or an assigning of the reason (See Append.)] for the doxology, as the particle <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span> [between <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>—<span class="greekheb">Θεῷ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>], implies, it not being likely that it is so placed without design. The whole may be thus paraphrased: <span class="ital">Glory</span> (be) <span class="ital">to God in the highest, and on earth</span> (may there be) <span class="ital">peace!</span> Why? Since there is <span class="ital">good will</span> [‘beneplacitum,’ God’s good pleasure and grace] <span class="ital">among men</span>. Iren. i. 3, c. 11, fol. 216, ed. Grab. is in conformity with this view. However, the second clause may be taken in closer connection with the first than with the third, so that there may be an Asyndeton [copula omitted] before the third clause; as in <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm" title="To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm" title="And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;">1 Samuel 3:2</a>. See Nold. Concord. part. p. 269.—<span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, <span class="ital">glory</span>) Implying the mystery of redemption, and its fruit and final consummation. Moreover we ought to observe the double antithesis: 1. between, <span class="ital">in the highest</span>, and, <span class="ital">on earth</span>; 2. between, to <span class="ital">God</span>, and, among <span class="ital">men</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑψίστοις</span>, <span class="ital">in the highest</span>) By the incarnation there are called forth praises given to God by the noblest of His creatures. They do not, however, say, <span class="ital">in heaven</span>, where even the angels dwell; but, employing a rare expression, <span class="ital">in the highest</span>, a place to which the angels do not aspire: <a href="/context/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:...">Hebrews 1:3-4</a>. They wish their giving of praise to ascend to the highest region.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span>) We are to observe the difference between this particle [<span class="ital">on</span> earth] and the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> [<span class="ital">in</span> the highest].—<span class="greekheb">γῆς</span>, <span class="ital">earth</span>) not merely in Judea; nor now any longer merely in heaven. The earth is wider in its comprehension [meaning] than <span class="ital">men:</span> for <span class="ital">the earth</span> is the theatre of action even of <span class="ital">the angels</span>. The dwellers in heaven say, <span class="ital">in</span> [<span class="ital">on</span>] <span class="ital">earth</span>; the dwellers on earth say, <span class="ital">in heaven</span> [“Peace <span class="ital">in heaven</span>, and glory in the highest,” at Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem], ch. <a href="/luke/19-38.htm" title="Saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.">Luke 19:38</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>, <span class="ital">peace</span>) <a href="/luke/2-29.htm" title="Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace, according to your word:">Luke 2:29</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώποις</span>, <span class="ital">men</span>) not merely among the Jews. Heretofore men had been regarded and spoken of unfavourably among angels: now these latter, as if in wonder, give utterance to what seemed a paradox, <span class="ital">good will among men!</span>—<span class="greekheb">εὐδοκία</span>, <span class="ital">good will</span>) The newly-manifested pleasure [favourable inclination] of God towards the whole human race [name], in his Well-Beloved.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/luke/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On earth peace</span>. At that juncture, strange to say, the Roman empire was at peace with all the world, and, as was ever the case in these brief rare moments of profound peace, the gates of the temple of Janus at Rome were closed, there being, as they supposed, no need for the presence of the god to guide and lead their conquering armies. Not a few have supposed that the angel choir in these words hymned this earthly peace. So Milton in his 'Ode to the Nativity' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No war or battle's sound<br />Was heard the world around<br />The idle spear and shield were high uphung:<br />The hooked chariot stood</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Unstained with hostile blood,<br />The trumpet spake not to the armed throng;<br />And kings sat still with awful eye<br />As if they surely knew their souvran Lord was by."</span> But the angels sang of something more real and enduring than this temporary lull. The gates of Janus were only too quickly thrown open again. Some seventy years later, within sight of the spot where the shepherds beheld the multitude of the heavenly host, the awful conflagration which accompanied the sack of the holy city and temple could have been plainly seen, and the shrieks and cries of the countless victims of the closing scenes of one of the most terrible wars which disfigure the red pages of history could almost have been heard. <span class="cmt_word">Good will toward men</span>. A bare majority of the old authorities read here, "On earth peace among men of good will;" in other words, among men who are the objects of God's good will and kindness. But the Greek text, from which our Authorized Version; was made, has the support of so many of the older manuscripts and ancient versions, that it is among scholars an open question whether or not the text followed in the Authorized Version should not in this place be adhered to. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Peace, good-will toward men (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>Both Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort read &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; which the Rev. follows.
