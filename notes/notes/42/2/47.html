The egotism of Josephus leads him to speak of himself as having, at the age of fourteen—when he too had become “a child of the Law”—caused a like astonishment by his intelligence; so that the chief priests and principal men of the city used to come and consult him upon difficult questions in the interpretation of the Law (<span class= "ital">Life, c.</span> 1).

His parents did not return till they had stayed all the seven days of the feast. It is well to stay to the end of an ordinance, as becomes those who say, It is good to be here. Those that have lost their comforts in Christ, and the evidences of their having a part in him, must bethink themselves where, and when, and how they lost them, and must turn back again. Those that would recover their lost acquaintance with Christ, must go to the place in which he has put his name; there they may hope to meet him. They found him in some part of the temple, where the doctors of the law kept their schools; he was sitting there, hearkening to their instructions, proposing questions, and answering inquiries, with such wisdom, that those who heard were delighted with him. Young persons should seek the knowledge of Divine truth, attend the ministry of the gospel, and ask such questions of their elders and teachers as may tend to increase their knowledge. Those who seek Christ in sorrow, shall find him with the greater joy. Know ye not that I ought to be in my Father's house; at my Father's work; I must be about my Father's business. Herein is an example; for it becomes the children of God, in conformity to Christ, to attend their heavenly Father's business, and make all other concerns give way to it. Though he was the Son of God, yet he was subject to his earthly parents; how then will the foolish and weak sons of men answer it, who are disobedient to their parents? However we may neglect men's sayings, because they are obscure, yet we must not think so of God's sayings. That which at first is dark, may afterwards become plain and easy. The greatest and wisest, those most eminent, may learn of this admirable and Divine Child, that it is the truest greatness of soul to know our own place and office; to deny ourselves amusements and pleasures not consistent with our state and calling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After three days - This means, probably, "on the third day" after they had left Jerusalem - that is, the first day they went toward Galilee, on the second they returned to Jerusalem, and on the third they found him. Compare <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>; <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>.<p>In the temple - In the "court" of the temple, for Jesus, not being a Levitical priest, could not enter into the temple itself.

There is no reason to suppose that this was for the purpose of perplexing or confounding them. The questions were doubtless proposed in a respectful manner, and the answers listened to with proper deference to their age and rank. Jesus was a child, and religion does not teach a child to be rude or uncivil, even though he may really know much more than more aged persons. Religion teaches all, and especially the young, to treat others with respect, to show them the honor that is due, to venerate age, and to speak kindly to all, <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-3.htm">Matthew 23:3</a>; <a href="/romans/13-7.htm">Romans 13:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46. hearing &#8230; asking&#8212;The method of question and answer was the customary form of rabbinical teaching; teacher and learner becoming by turns questioner and answerer, as may be seen from their extant works. This would give full scope for all that "astonished them in His understanding and answers." Not that He assumed the office of teaching&#8212;"His hour" for that "was not yet come," and His equipment for that was not complete; for He had yet to "increase in wisdom" as well as "stature" (Lu 2:52). In fact, the beauty of Christ's example lies very much in His never at one stage of His life anticipating the duties of another. All would be in the style and manner of a learner, "opening His mouth and panting." "His soul breaking for the longing that it had unto God's judgments at all times" (Ps 119:20), and now more than ever before, when finding Himself for the first time in His Father's house. Still there would be in His questions far more than in their answers; and if we may take the frivolous interrogatories with which they afterwards plied Him, about the woman that had seven husbands and such like, as a specimen of their present drivelling questions, perhaps we shall not greatly err, if we suppose that "the questions" which He now "asked them" in return were just the germs of those pregnant questions with which He astonished and silenced them in after years: "What think ye of Christ? Whose Son is He? If David call Him Lord, how is He then his Son?" "Which is the first and great commandment?" "Who is my neighbour?"<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What was the subject matter of the doctors’ and Christ’s discourses is vainly questioned, only in the general we may be assured it was something about the Divine law; what the particular themes or subjects were is not material for us to inquire.

This breaking forth of the consciousness of Divine Sonship[61] in the first saying which is preserved to us from Jesus, is to be explained by the power of the impressions which He experienced on His first participation in the holy observances of the festival and the temple. According to <a href="/luke/2-50.htm" title="And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.">Luke 2:50</a>, it must not have previously asserted itself thus amidst the quiet course of His domestic development (“non multum antea, nec tamen nihil, de Patre locutus erat,” Bengel on <a href="/luke/2-50.htm" title="And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.">Luke 2:50</a>), but now there had emerged with Him an <span class="ital">epoch</span> in the course of development of that consciousness of Sonship,—the first bursting open of the swelling bud. Altogether foreign to the ingenuous, child-like utterance, unnatural and indelicate, is the intention <span class="ital">of drawing a contrast</span> which has been imputed to Him: <span class="greekheb">τῆς γὰρ παρθένου τὸν Ἰωσὴφ πατέρα εἰπούσης αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος φησίν</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐκ αὐτὸς ἐστὶν ὁ ἀληθής μου πατὴρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἢ γὰρ ἂν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ ἤμην</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὁ Θεὸς ἐστί μου πατὴρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ εἰμί</span>, Theophylact. Erroneous in an opposite manner is the opinion of Schenkel, that the boy Jesus named God His Father, “<span class="ital">just as every pious Jewish child might do</span>.” Such a conclusion could only be arrived at, if He had said <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατρὸς ἡμῶν</span>; but with Jesus in the connection of His entire history <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΑΤΡΌς ΜΟΥ</span></span></span> points to a higher individual relation.
