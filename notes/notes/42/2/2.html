Publicius Sulpicius Quirinus (“Cyrenius” is the Greek form of the last of the three names) was Consul B.C. 12, but he is not named as Governor of Syria till after the deposition of Archelaus, A.D. 6, and he was then conspicuous in carrying out a census which involved taxation in the modern sense; and this was the “taxing” referred to in Gamaliel’s speech (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>) as having led to the revolt of Judas of Galilee. How are we to explain the statement of St. Luke so as to reconcile it with the facts of history? (1) The word translated “first” has been taken as if it meant “before,” as it is rendered in <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="/john/1-30.htm" title="This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:30</a>. This cuts the knot of the difficulty, but it is hardly satisfactory. This construction is not found elsewhere in St. Luke, and his manner is to refer to contemporary events, not to subsequent ones. It is hardly natural to speak of one event simply as happening before another, with no hint as to the interval that separated them, when that interval included ten or twelve years. (2) Our knowledge of the governors of Syria at this period is imperfect. The dates of their appointments, so far as they go, are as follows:—<p>B.C. 9.—Sentius Saturninus.<p>B.C. 6.—T. Quintilius Varus.<p>A.D. 6.—P. Sulpicius Quirinus.<p>It was, however, part of the policy of Augustus that no governor of an imperial province should hold office for more than five or less than three years, and it is in the highest degree improbable that Varus (whom we find in A.D. 7 in command of the ill-fated expedition against the Germans) should have continued in office for the twelve years which the above dates suggest. One of the missing links is found in A. Volusius Saturninus, whose name appears on a coin of Antioch about A.D. 4 or 5. The fact that Quirinus appears as a <span class= "ital">rector,</span> or special commissioner attached to Caius Cæsar, when he was sent to Armenia (Tac. <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> iii. 48), at some period before A.D. 4, the year in which Caius died—probably between B.C. 4 and 1—shows that he was in the East at this time, and we may therefore fairly look on St. Luke as having supplied the missing link in the succession, or at least as confirming the statement that Quirinus was in some office of authority in the East, if not as <span class= "ital">præses,</span> or <span class= "ital">proconsul</span> then as <span class= "ital">quætor</span> or Imperial Commissioner. Tacitus, however, records the fact that he triumphed over a Cilician tribe (the Homonadenses) after his consulship; and, as Cilicia was, at that time, attached to the province of Syria, it is probable that he was actually “governor” in the stricter sense of a term somewhat loosely used. St. Luke is, on this view, as accurate in his history here as he is proved to be in all other points where he comes in contact with the contemporary history of the empire, and the true meaning is found by emphasising the adjective, “This enrolment was the first under Quirinus’s government of Syria.” He expressly distinguishes it, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from the more memorable “taxing” of which Gamaliel speaks (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>). St. Luke, it may be noted, is the only New Testament writer who uses the word. Justin Martyr, it may be added, confidently appeals to Roman registers as confirming St. Luke’s statement that our Lord was born under Quirinus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/luke/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/luke/2-2.htm" title="(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)">Luke 2:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">And this taxing </span>(rather <span class="ital">this enrolling</span>) <span class="ital">was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria </span>— According to the Jewish historian, Josephus, Cyrenius was not governor of Syria till ten or twelve years after our Saviour’s birth, after Archelaus was deposed, and the country brought under a Roman procurator; yet, according to our translation of Luke here, he was governor before the death of Herod, the father and predecessor of Archelaus, and in the same year when Christ was born. Now as, on the one hand, it cannot be supposed that a writer so accurate as Luke (were he considered only as a common historian) should make so gross a mistake as to confound the enrolment in the reign of Herod with that taxation under Cyrenius, which happened many years after; so, on the other hand, it is hard to conceive that Josephus should be mistaken in an affair of so public a nature, so important, and so recent when he wrote his history. To remove this difficulty, 1st, Some have supposed a corruption of the original text in Luke; and that, instead of Cyrenius, it ought to be read Saturninus, who, according to Josephus, was prefect of Syria within a year or two before Herod’s death. 2d, Others have thought it probable, that the original name in Luke was Quintilius; since Quintilius Varus succeeded Saturninus, and was in the province of Syria when Herod died. But all the Greek manuscripts remonstrate against both these solutions. Therefore, 3d, Mr. Whiston and Dr. Prideaux suppose, that the words of the preceding verse, <span class="ital">In those days there went out a decree, </span>&c., refer to the time of making the census; and the subsequent words, <span class="ital">This enrolment was first made, </span>&c., to the time of levying the tax. “When Judea,” says the latter, “was put under a Roman procurator, then taxes were first paid to the Romans — and Publius Sulpicius Quirinius, who is in Greek called Cyrenius, was governor of Syria: so that there were two distinct particular actions in this matter, done at two distinct and different times: the first was making the survey, and the second the levying the tax thereupon. And the first verse here is to be understood of the former, and the second only of the latter. And this reconciles that evangelist with Josephus; for it is manifest from that author, that Cyrenius was not governor of Syria, or any tax levied on Judea, till Archelaus was deposed. And therefore the making of the description cannot be that which was done while Cyrenius was governor of Syria; — but the levying the tax thereon certainly was.” In accordance with this interpretation of the passage, Dr. Campbell reads the verse, <span class="ital">This first register took effect when Cyrenius was president of Syria, </span>observing that, by this translation of the words, divers objections are obviated. “The register,” says he, “whatever was the intention of it, was made in Herod’s time, but had then little or no consequences. When, after the banishment of Archelaus, Judea was annexed to Syria, and converted into a province, the register of the inhabitants formerly taken served as a directory for laying on the <span class="ital">census, </span>to which the country was then subjected. Not but that there must have happened considerable changes on the people during that period. But the errors which these changes might occasion, could, with proper attention, be easily rectified. And thus it might be justly said, that an enrolment which had been made several years before, did not take effect, or produce consequences worthy of notice, till then.” Dr. Hammond and Dr. Lardner, however, give what many think a still easier solution of this difficulty, rendering the words thus: <span class="ital">This was the first enrolment of Cyrenius, governor of Syria, </span>supposing that Cyrenius (afterward governor of Syria, and at the time Luke wrote well known by that title) was employed in making the first enrolment of the inhabitants of Judea in the reign of Herod; to which purpose Dr. Hammond quotes Suidas as relating, on the authority of an ancient author, that “Cesar Augustus, desiring to know the strength and state of his dominions, sent twenty chosen men, one into one part, another into another, to take this account; and that Publius Sulpicius Quirinius had Syria for his province.” The reader will of course adopt the interpretation which he judges most probable.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The fulness of time was now come, when God would send forth his Son, made of a woman, and made under the law. The circumstances of his birth were very mean. Christ was born at an inn; he came into the world to sojourn here for awhile, as at an inn, and to teach us to do likewise. We are become by sin like an outcast infant, helpless and forlorn; and such a one was Christ. He well knew how unwilling we are to be meanly lodged, clothed, or fed; how we desire to have our children decorated and indulged; how apt the poor are to envy the rich, and how prone the rich to disdain the poor. But when we by faith view the Son of God being made man and lying in a manger, our vanity, ambition, and envy are checked. We cannot, with this object rightly before us, seek great things for ourselves or our children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And this taxing was first made ... - This verse has given as much perplexity, perhaps, as any one in the New Testament. The difficulty consists in the fact that "Cyrenius," or "Quirinius," was not governor of Syria until 12 or 15 years after the birth of Jesus. Jesus was born during the reign of Herod. At that time "Varus" was president of Syria. Herod was succeeded by "Archelaus," who reigned eight or nine years; and after he was removed, Judea was annexed to the province of Syria, and Cyrenius was sent as the governor (Josephus, "Ant.," b. xvii. 5). The difficulty has been to reconcile this account with that in Luke. Various attempts have been made to do this. The one that seems most satisfactory is that proposed by Dr. Lardner. According to his view, the passage here means, "This was the "first" census of Cyrenius, governor of Syria." It is called the "first" to distinguish it from one "afterward" taken by Cyrenius, <a href="/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>. It is said to be the census taken by "Cyrenius; governor of Syria; "not that he was "then" governor, but that it was taken by him who was afterward familiarly known as governor. "Cyrenius, governor of Syria," was the name by which the man was known when Luke wrote his gospel, and it was not improper to say that the taxing was made by Cyrenius, the governor of Syria," though he might not have been actually governor for many years afterward. Thus, Herodian says that to Marcus "the emperor" were born several daughters and two sons," though several of those children were born to him "before" he was emperor. Thus, it is not improper to say that General Washington saved Braddock's army, or was engaged in the old French war, though he was not actually made "general" until many years afterward. According to this Augustus sent Cyrenius, an active, enterprising man, to take the census. At that time he was a Roman senator. Afterward, he was made governor of the same country, and received the title which Luke gives him.<p>Syria - The region of country north of Palestine, and lying between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates. "Syria," called in the Hebrew "Aram," from a son of Shem <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>, in its largest acceptation extended from the Mediterranean and the river Cydnus to the Euphrates, and from Mount Taurus on the north to Arabia and the border of Egypt on the south. It was divided into "Syria Palestina," including Canaan and Phoenicia; "Coele-Syria," the tract of country lying between two ridges of Mount Lebanon and Upper Syria. The last was known as "Syria" in the restricted sense, or as the term was commonly used.<p>The leading features in the physical aspect of Syria consist of the great mountainous chains of Lebanon, or Libanus and Anti-Libanus, extending from north to south, and the great desert lying on the southeast and east. The valleys are of great fertility, and yield abundance of grain, vines, mulberries, tobacco, olives, excellent fruits, as oranges, figs, pistachios, etc. The climate in the inhabited parts is exceedingly fine. Syria is inhabited by various descriptions of people, but Turks and Greeks form the basis of the population in the cities. The only tribes that can be considered as unique to Syria are the tenants of the heights of Lebanon. The most remarkable of these are the Druses and Maronites. The general language is Arabic; the soldiers and officers of government speak Turkish. Of the old Syriac language no traces now exist. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/luke/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. first &#8230; when Cyrenius, &c.&#8212;a very perplexing verse, inasmuch as Cyrenius, or Quirinus, appears not to have been governor of Syria for about ten years after the birth of Christ, and the "taxing" under his administration was what led to the insurrection mentioned in Ac 5:37. That there was a taxing, however, of the whole Roman Empire under Augustus, is now admitted by all; and candid critics, even of skeptical tendency, are ready to allow that there is not likely to be any real inaccuracy in the statement of our Evangelist. Many superior scholars would render the words thus, "This registration was previous to Cyrenius being governor of Syria"&#8212;as the word "first" is rendered in Joh 1:15; 15:18. In this case, of course, the difficulty vanishes. But it is perhaps better to suppose, with others, that the registration may have been ordered with a view to the taxation, about the time of our Lord's birth, though the taxing itself&#8212;an obnoxious measure in Palestine&#8212;was not carried out till the time of Quirinus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/luke/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/luke/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And this taxing was first made,....

This expedient would only be possible, if <span class="greekheb">ἡγεμον</span>. stood <span class="ital">by itself</span> in the passage, and not <span class="greekheb">τῆς Συρίας</span> beside it. And if <span class="greekheb">ἡγεμον</span>. were meant <span class="ital">proleptically</span>: under the <span class="ital">subsequent</span> praeses (Lardner in Bowyer, <span class="ital">Conject.</span> I. p. 120; Münter), Luke could hardly have proceeded more awkwardly than by thus <span class="ital">omitting</span> the point whereon his being understood depended (it must have been expressed in some such way as <span class="greekheb">Κυρηνίου τοῦ ὕστερον ἡγεμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς Συρίας</span>). (3) Gerlach thinks that at the time of Christ’s birth Varus, indeed, was <span class="greekheb">ἡγεμών</span> of Syria, but Quirinius was placed by his side as <span class="ital">legatus Caesaris proconsulari potestate</span> for the purpose of making war upon the Homonades, and had at that time—consequently likewise as <span class="greekheb">ἡγεμών</span>—undertaken the census, which, however, he brought to no right conclusion, and only carried out subsequently under his second <span class="ital">praesidium</span>. But granted that the Tiburtine inscription (see upon that subject Gerlach, p. 25, 39 ff.), which Huschke refers to <span class="ital">Agrippa</span>, Zumpt to <span class="ital">Saturninus</span>, is rightly referred, with Sanclemente, Nipperdey, Bergmann, and Gerlach, to Quirinius, and that a twofold legatio of the latter to Asia took place: how could Luke with his simple and plain words intend to designate that complicated historical relation and leave the reader to guess it? To the latter Quirinius presented himself only as ordinary and single praeses of Syria. Compare, moreover, what is said afterwards in opposition to von Gumpach. (4) At variance with the text is the expedient of Paulus, who substantially is followed by Gersdorf, Glöckler, Krabbe, Mack (<span class="ital">Bericht üb.</span> Strauss, <span class="ital">krit.

(5) Von Gumpach lays stress on <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span>,[42] whereby he regards Luke as indicating that in <a href="/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a> he has spoken only of the <span class="ital">placing on the register</span>, and would not have the same confounded with the actual <span class="ital">levying of taxation</span>, which was <span class="ital">not carried into execution until</span> under Quirinius. Against this it may be urged that Luke would have known how to express the <span class="ital">realization</span>, as contrasted with <span class="ital">what was intended</span>, otherwise than by the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span>, or that he would at least have placed this word, and that with a more precise definition (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὌΝΤΩς ΔῈ ἘΓΈΝΕΤΟ</span></span></span>, or the like), at the head of the sentence; as well as that he, in order to have the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΓΡΑΦΉ</span></span></span> recognised as something different from and later than the mere registration, must have made use of <span class="ital">another</span> word, and not again of <span class="greekheb">ἀπογραφή</span> so similar to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΓΡΆΦΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>. (6) Aberle seeks by learned combination to show that even before the death of Herod Quirinius had actually become <span class="ital">praeses Syriae</span>, but that as <span class="ital">rector juventutis</span> to the emperor’s grandson Caius, he was still temporarily detained in Rome by Augustus,[43] and his governorship remained virtually unknown in the east and west, but is to be assigned to the year 749. But while there is certain attestation that he was <span class="ital">rector juventutis</span> to Caius (Tacitus, <span class="ital">Ann.</span> iii. 48), in which post he was succeeded by Lollius (see Zumpt, p. 102), there is no evidence at all for the assumption of a contemporary <span class="ital">praesidium Syriae</span>, which he must have held nominally (thus somewhat like an <span class="ital">episcopus in partibus</span>). And how should this state of things, which had remained unknown and was only noticed by jurists and notaries for the sake of the dating of documents, have become known to Luke in particular, and have been left by him without any explanation, in such a way that from his words we can only understand the <span class="ital">praeses Syriae</span> in the primary and usual sense, according to which the <span class="ital">praeses</span> resides in his province and administers the same?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not to be inferred, moreover, from the ignorance which Luke betrays at <a href="/acts/5-36.htm" title="For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.">Acts 5:36</a> ff., that the addition <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> proceeds not from Luke, but from an older Jewish-Christian writer (Köstlin, p. 245); for that ignorance concerned not the census of Quirinius, but the time of the insurrection of Theudas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΓΕΜΟΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] the general word for the post of a chief, here shown by the context (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΣΥΡΊΑς</span></span></span>) to be used of the provincial chief, <span class="ital">praeses</span> (proconsul).

In the case of the Roman writers (especially Florus, iv. 12. 41; Tacitus, <span class="ital">Ann.</span> ii. 30, iii. 22. 48) the manuscripts vary; from a coin and inscription, which have <span class="ital">Quirinus</span>, nothing can be decided in view of the great doubt as to their genuineness.[44] But it is certain that among the Greeks (Strabo, xii. 6, p. 569; Josephus, Justin Martyr) the name is written with the termination <span class="greekheb">ΙΟΣ</span>; and, as this manner of writing is at all events decidedly correct in our passage (C D E F, etc., including <span class="greekheb">א</span>, likewise Eusebius, Chrysostom, etc.), whereas among the codices only B reads <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΕΊΝΟΥ</span></span></span> (hence Lachmann reads <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΥΡΊΝΟΥ</span></span></span>), the form <span class="ital">Quirinius</span>, which easily became confounded with the familiar Roman word Quirinus (= <span class="ital">Quirinalis</span>), is to be preferred. The confusion occurred the more easily, as <span class="ital">Quirinus</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κυρῖνος</span> (Plutarch), or <span class="greekheb">Κυρίνος</span> (Leon. Philippians 1) was also a Roman name. At all events, <span class="ital">Luke himself</span> had in his mind the name <span class="ital">Quirinius</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] Not: it took place <span class="ital">first, when</span>,—came to be carried out <span class="ital">not earlier than</span> when Quirinius, etc. Lichtenstein, p. 81 f., comes ultimately to this meaning. How can this be expressed by <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>? Instead of <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> Luke must have written precisely the opposite, namely, <span class="greekheb">ὕστερον</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ὕστερον δὴ ἐγένετο κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Hofmann is similarly mistaken, <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> II. 1, p. 120 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[37] Quite definitely Justin also says, in agreement with Luke, that Christ was born <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ Κυρηνίου</span> (<span class="ital">Apol.</span> i. 46), and even that His birth was to be seen <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ἀπογραφῶν τῶν γενομένεν ἐπὶ Κυρηνίου τοῦ ὑμετέρου ἐν Ἰουδαίᾳ πρώτου γενομένου ἐπιτρόπου</span>, <span class="ital">Apol.</span> i. 34; so that he in another erroneous manner (see Credner, <span class="ital">Beitr.</span> I. p. 230) makes the man to be Roman procurator in <span class="ital">Judaea</span>.

But the position that Quirinius had not been already <span class="ital">governor</span> of Syria at an earlier date (according to Zumpt, from 4 to 1 before Christ) must be adhered to, according to all the accounts given of him by Josephus (especially <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xviii. 1. 1). Comp. Ewald, <span class="ital">Gesch. Chr.</span> p. 140 f. The words ITERVM.

This is a makeshift, which imputes to Luke a very <span class="ital">enigmatical and awkward</span> use of the word <span class="greekheb">ἀπογραφή</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[42] So also does Köhler, who besides, with Hofmann and Ebrard, lays stress on the fact that the passage runs not as <span class="greekheb">ἡ πρώτη</span>, but simply <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>. Luke is thus made to say: <span class="ital">this taxation was completed as the first taxation</span>, etc.; it was, namely, <span class="ital">begun</span> doubtless, but was soon <span class="ital">stopped</span> and was only <span class="ital">carried out</span> under Quirinius. Comp. already Calvin and Gerlach above. Nothing of this appears in the text, and the article with <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> would make no difference at all, since, as is well known, the ordinal numbers may stand with or without an article.

For (1) the <span class="ital">praesidium</span> of Quirinius is placed about ten years too early; and (2) an imperial census, if such an one should have been held at all at the time of the birth of Jesus (which, however, cannot from other sources be proved, for the passages of Christian authors, Cassiodorus, <span class="ital">var.</span> iii. 52, Suidas, <span class="ital">s.v.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀπογραφή</span>, plainly depend on the narrative of Luke, as also does the chronologically erroneous statement of Isidor. <span class="ital">Orig.</span> v. 36. 4), cannot have affected Palestine at all,[45] since it had not yet become a Roman province, which did not happen till 759. And, indeed, the ordaining of so abnormal and disturbing a measure in reference to Palestine—a measure, which assuredly would not be carried through without tumultuary resistance—would have been so uncommonly important for Jewish history, that Josephus would certainly not have passed it over in absolute silence (<span class="ital">Antt.</span> xvii. 1. 1 does not bear on it); especially as it was not the <span class="ital">rex socius</span> himself, Herod, but the Roman governor, who was, according to Luke (in opposition to Wieseler), the authority conducting it. But (3) the holding withal of a general census of the empire under Augustus is historically altogether unvouched for; it is a matter of history (see the <span class="ital">Monum. Ancyran.</span> in Wolf, ed. Sueton. II. p. 369 ff.; comp. Sueton. <span class="ital">Aug.</span> 27) that Augustus thrice, in 726, 746, and 767, held a <span class="ital">census populi, i.e.</span> a census of the Roman citizens, but not also of the whole provinces of the empire (see, in opposition to Huschke, Wieseler, p. 84 ff.). Should we, on the other hand, assume, with Wieseler, that the census had only the <span class="ital">provinces</span> in view and had been taken up in the different provinces in different years, and with the utmost indulgence to provincial peculiarities,—the object aimed at being the settling of an uniform system of taxation (comp. Savigny in the <span class="ital">Zeitschr. für geschichtl. Rechtswiss.</span> VI. p. 350),—the text of Luke would stand opposed to it. For, according to that text, (<span class="ital">a</span>) the <span class="ital">whole Roman empire is subjected to a census; (b</span>) this quite universal census is ordained <span class="ital">at once in the edict</span>, which, on Wieseler’s hypothesis of the gradual and indulgent mode of its execution by the politic Augustus, would have been imprudent; and (<span class="ital">c</span>) it is represented as an <span class="ital">actual tax-census</span>, as was the well-known (according to Luke, <span class="ital">second</span>) census Quirinii, in which case the alleged indulgence is <span class="ital">imported</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[45] See Mommsen in Bergm. p. iv. ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nevertheless, criticism pronounces judgment on itself, when it designates the whole account as to the census as an invention of legend (Strauss; comp. Kern, <span class="ital">Urspr. des Evang.</span> p. 113 ff.; Weisse, I. p. 236), or even of Luke (B. Bauer), which is made in order to bring Mary with Joseph to Bethlehem. Comp. the frivolous opinion of Eichthal, II. p. 184 f. What a strange and disproportionate machinery for this purpose! No; <span class="ital">something of the nature</span> of a census, and that by command of the emperor, must have taken place in the Roman empire[46]—a registration, as regards which it is quite an open question whether it was taken with or without a design to the future regulation of taxation, or merely had for its aim the levying of statistics. The consolidating aims of the government of Augustus, and, in reference to Palestine, the dependence of the vassal-king Herod, take away from it all historical improbability, even apart from the analogous measure—that had already preceded it—of the survey of the whole Roman empire instituted by Augustus (Frontinus in the <span class="ital">Auct. rei agrar.</span>, ed. Goes. p. 109; Aethicus Ister, <span class="ital">Cosmogr.</span>, ed Gronov. p. 26). Further, as Quirinius was not at that time praeses, he can only have acted in this statistical measure as extraordinary commissioner, which is the less improbable, because apart from this he was then in the East by order of the emperor (see above), and because the politic Augustus very naturally as to that business put more confidence in an approved impartial commissioner than in the <span class="ital">reges socii</span> themselves or in the interested proconsuls. And this action of <span class="ital">Quirinius</span> enables us to understand how tradition, in the gradual obscuring and mixing up of its recollections, should have made him <span class="ital">praeses Syriae</span> at that time, since he was so <span class="ital">subsequently</span>, and how the registration in question was made into a <span class="ital">census</span>, because <span class="ital">subsequently</span> he actually as Syrian governor[47] had charge of a census; and from this mixing up of times and matters resulted at the same time the designation of the <span class="greekheb">ἀπογραφή</span> as <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>, which occurred <span class="greekheb">ἡγεμονεύοντος τῆς Συρίας Κυρηνίου</span>. Thus Luke has <span class="ital">narrated</span> what actually <span class="ital">happened</span> in the <span class="ital">erroneous form</span> which it received from the tradition. But if we conceive of the <span class="greekheb">ἀπογραφή</span> as merely a <span class="ital">revision of the genealogical family registers</span> (Schleiermaeher, Olshausen, ed. 1, Bleek), which probably was ordained only by the spiritual authorities, and perhaps had reference merely to the family of David, it is no longer easy to see how Luke, or the source from which he drew, could make out of it something thoroughly and specifically different. According to Schweizer in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1847, p. 1 ff., Luke has really in the passage before us, at variance with <a href="/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>, made Jesus be born in the year of the taxing of Quirinius, <a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>, and thus long after the death of Herod,—in spite of his own distinct statement, <a href="/luke/1-5.htm" title="THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.">Luke 1:5</a>!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The hypotheses, moreover, that Luke intended by the enrolment of Jesus (?) in the register of the Empire to point to the <span class="ital">universal destination</span> of the Redeemer (Wieseler; comp. Erasmus, Bengel, and already Theophylact and Euthymius Zigabenus), or to the <span class="ital">coincidence</span> of the birth of the Messiah and the redemption of Israel <span class="ital">with the political bondage of the people</span> (Ebrard), or to the manner in which Jesus in His mother’s womb was most surprisingly dealt with <span class="ital">as a Roman subject</span> (Hofmann), are purely arbitrary creations of that subjectivity, which has the utmost delight in discovering a mystical reference behind every simple historical statement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[46] Possibly of the population, of the civil and military resources, of the finances, etc., as, according to Tacitus, <span class="ital">Ann.</span> i. 11, the <span class="ital">Breviarium totius imperii</span> (Sueton. <span class="ital">Octav.</span> 28, 101) of Augustus contained columns of that kind. See above on ver. 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[47] Aberle, indeed, calls this in question, holding that Quirinius was at the later census merely a simple Legatus Caesaris. Although Josephus does not expressly name him <span class="greekheb">ἡγεμών</span>, he is still, in <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xviii. 1. 1, sufficiently indicated as such. Comp. Hilgenfeld, p. 413 ff. Apart from this, the expression <span class="greekheb">ἡγεμονεύοντος</span> in the passage before us is only an erroneously anticipating <span class="ital">reflex</span> of that, which <span class="ital">subsequently</span> Quirinius was <span class="ital">in fact</span>, and <span class="ital">notoriously</span>, as respects his real census attended by consequences so grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/luke/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/luke/2-2.htm" title="(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)">Luke 2:2</a>. This verse looks like a parenthetical explanation, and is actually bracketed in W.H[21] One could almost wish it had been omitted, or that there were reason to believe, as has been suggested by several writers, that it is a gloss that has found its way into the text, and that Lk. is not responsible for it—so much trouble has it given to commentators. Text and sense have alike been disputed.—<span class="greekheb">αυτη</span> has been taken as <span class="greekheb">αὐτή</span> = self, not <span class="greekheb">αὕτη</span> = <span class="ital">illa</span>, the same, to make room for a distinction between the decree and its execution or completion ten years after by Quirinius, so meeting difficulty No. 3. This device is now generally discarded. <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> has been taken as = <span class="greekheb">προτέρα</span>, meaning: this census took place <span class="ital">before</span> Quirinius was governor, a possible but very improbable rendering, not to say that one fails to see the object of such a statement. The true text is <span class="greekheb">αὕτη ἀπογ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρώτη ἐγέν</span>., and the meaning: that census took place, as a first, when, etc. But why <span class="ital">as a first</span>? Because, reply many, there was a second, under the same Quirinius, ten years later, known to Lk. (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>), disastrous in its consequence, and which he was anxious his readers should not confound with this one (so Hahn and others).—<span class="greekheb">ἡγεμονεύοντος</span>: this raises a question of fact. Was Quirinius governor then? He was, admittedly, governor of Syria ten years later, when he made the census referred to in <a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>. Either there is a mistake here, or Quirinius was governor twice (so A. W. Zumpt, strenuously supported by Farrar, C. G. T., <span class="ital">ad loc</span>.), or at least present in Syria, at the time of Christ’s birth, in some capacity, say as a commissioner in connection with the census.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[21] Westcott and Hort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/luke/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">this first enrolment took place</span> (literally ‘took place as the <span class="ital">first</span>’) <span class="bld">when Quirinus was governor of Syria</span>. We are here met by an apparent error on which whole volumes have been written. Quirinus (or Quirinius, for the form of his name is not absolutely certain) was governor (Praeses, Legatus) of Syria in a. d. 6, <span class="ital">ten years after this time</span>, and he <span class="ital">then</span> carried out a census which led to the revolt of Judas of Galilee, as St Luke himself was aware (<a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>). Hence it is asserted that St Luke made an error of ten years in the governorship of Quirinus, and the date of the census, which vitiates his historic authority. Two ways of obviating this difficulty may finally be rejected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">α</span>) One is to render the words ‘took place <span class="ital">before</span> (<span class="ital">protç</span>) Quirinus was governor.’ The translation is entirely untenable, and is not supported by <span class="ital">protos mou</span> ‘before me’ in <a href="/john/1-30.htm" title="This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:30</a>. And if this were the meaning the remark would be most unnecessary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">β</span>) Others would render the verb <span class="ital">egeneto</span> by ‘took effect:’—this enrolment was begun at this period (b. c. 4 of our vulgar era) by P. Sentius Saturninus, but not completed till the Procuratorship of Quirinus a. d. 6. But this is to give a strained meaning to the verb, as well as to take the ordinal (<span class="ital">protç</span>) as though it were an adverb (<span class="ital">proton</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">γ</span>) A third, and more tenable, view is to extend the meaning of <span class="ital">hegemoneuontos</span> ‘was governor’ to imply that Quirinus, though not actually <span class="ital">Governor</span> of Syria, yet might be called <span class="ital">hegemon</span>, either (i) as one of the twenty taxers or commissioners of Augustus, or (ii) as holding some procuratorial office (as <span class="ital">Epitropos</span> or <span class="ital">joint Epitropos</span> with Herod; comp. Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xv. 10. 3; <span class="ital">B. J.</span> i. 20. 4). It is, however, a strong objection to solution (i) that the commissioners were <span class="greekheb">ἄριστοι</span>, <span class="ital">optimates</span> or nobles, whereas Quirinus was a <span class="ital">novus homo</span>: and to (ii) that St Luke is remarkably accurate in his use of titles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greekheb">δ</span>) A fourth view, and one which I still hold to be the right solution, is that first developed by A. W. Zumpt (<span class="ital">Das Geburtsjahr Christi</span>, 1870), and never seriously refuted though often sneered at. It is that Quirinus was <span class="ital">twice</span> Governor of Syria, once in b. c. 4 when he began the census (which may have been <span class="ital">ordered</span>, as Tertullian says, by Varus, or by P. Sentius Saturninus); and once in a. d. 6 when he carried it to completion. It is certain that in a.u.c. 753 Quirinus conquered the Homonadenses in Cilicia, and was <span class="ital">rector</span> to Gaius Caesar. Now it is highly probable that these Homonadenses were at that time under the jurisdiction of the propraetor of the Imperial Province of Syria, an office which must in that case have been held by Quirinus between b. c. 4–b. c. 1. The indolence of Varus and his friendship with Archelaus may have furnished strong reasons for superseding him, and putting the diligent and trustworthy Quirinus in his place. Whichever of these latter views be accepted, one thing is certain, that no error is <span class="ital">demonstrable</span>, and that on independent historical grounds, as well as by his own proved accuracy in other instances, we have the strongest reason to admit the probability of St Luke’s reference.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Cyrenius</span>] This is the Greek form of the name Quirinus, Orelli ad Tac. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> ii. 30. All that we know of him is that he was of obscure and provincial origin, and rose to the consulship by activity and military skill, afterwards earning a triumph for his successes in Cilicia. He was harsh, and avaricious, but a loyal soldier; and he was honoured with a public funeral in a. d. 21 (Tac. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> ii. 30, iii. 22, 48; Suet. <span class="ital">Tib.</span> 49, &c.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/luke/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/luke/2-2.htm" title="(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)">Luke 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πρώτη</span>, <span class="ital">first</span>) first in respect to the Jews, who had previously paid tribute without being entered [registered] in a census-roll.—<span class="greekheb">ἡγεμονεύοντος</span>) <span class="ital">when</span> P.

Quirinius, it is well known, was governor (legatus or praeses) of Syria ten years later, and during his office a census or registration - with a view to taxation - which led to a popular disturbance, was made in his province. These critics say that St. Luke mentions, as taking place before the birth of Jesus, an event which really happened ten years after. Much historical vestigation has been made with a view to explain this difficulty. It has been now satisfactorily demonstrated that, strangely enough, this Quirinius - who ten years later was certainly governor (legatus) of Syria - at the time of the birth of the Savior held high office in Syria, either as praeses (governor) or quaestor (imperial commissioner). The Greek word rendered by the English "governor" would have been used for either of these important offices. On the whole question of these alleged historical inaccuracies of St. Luke, it may be observed: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Strangely enough, none of the early opponents of Christianity, such as Celsus or Porphyry, impugn the accuracy of our evangelist here. Surely, if there had been so marked an error on the threshold of his Gospel, these distinguished adversaries of our faith, living comparatively soon after the events in question, would have been the first to hit so conspicuous a blot in the story they hated so well. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> nothing is more improbable than that St. Luke, a man of education, and writing, too, evidently for people of thought and culture, would have ventured on a definite historical statement of this kind, which would, if wrong, have been so easily exposed, had he not previously thoroughly satisfied himself as to its complete accuracy. Generally, the above conclusions are now adopted, lately, amongst others, by Godet, Farrar, Plumptre, and Bishop Ellicott (in his Hulsean Lectures). Godet has an especially long and exhaustive note on this subject. The conclusions are mainly drawn from the researches of such scholars as Zumpt and Mommsen. <span class="cmt_word">Cyrenius</span>; Latin, Quirinus. He is mentioned by the historians Tacitus and Suetonius. He appears to have been originally of humble birth, and, like so many of the soldiers of fortune of the empire, rose through his own merits to his great position. He was a gallant and true soldier, but withal self-seeking and harsh. For his Cilician victories the senate decreed him a triumph. He received the distinguished honor of a public funeral, A.D. 21 (Tac., 'Ann.,' 2:30; 3:22, 48; Suet., 'Tib.,' 49). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/luke/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And this taxing was first made (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>Rather, this occurred as the first enrolment ; or, as Rev., this was the first enrolment made; with reference to a second enrolment which took place about eleven years later, and is referred to in <a href="/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>. </body></html>
