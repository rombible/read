whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>. <span class="ital">And she brought forth her firstborn son </span>— <span class="greekheb">Τον υιον αυτης τον πρωτοτοκον</span>, <span class="ital">her son, the firstborn; </span>that excellent and glorious person, who was the firstborn of every creature, and the heir of all things. See note on <a href="/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>. <span class="ital">And wrapped him in swaddling-clothes </span>— By her doing this herself, it is thought her labour was without the usual pangs of childbearing. <span class="ital">And laid him in a manger </span>— Though the word <span class="greekheb">φατνη</span>, here used, sometimes signifies <span class="ital">a stall, </span>yet it is certain it more frequently signifies <span class="ital">a manger, </span>and certainly the manger was the most proper part of the stall in which the infant could be laid. As to the notion of Bishop Pearce, that not <span class="ital">a manger </span>is here meant, but <span class="ital">a bag of coarse cloth, </span>like those out of which the horses of our troopers are fed when encamped; and that this bag was fastened to the wall, or some other part, not of a stable, but of the guest- chamber, or room for the reception of strangers, where Joseph and Mary were lodged; this odd notion is amply confuted by Dr. Campbell in a very long note on this passage. Tradition informs us that the stable, in which the holy family was lodged, was, according to the custom of the country, hollowed out of a rock, and consequently the coldness of it, at least by night, must have greatly added to its other inconveniences. <span class="ital">Because there was no room for them in the inn </span>— The concourse of people at Bethlehem being very great on this occasion. It seems there was but one principal inn at Bethlehem, now but a small village, and that when Joseph came thither it was full, so that he and Mary were obliged to lodge in a stable, fitted up as a receptacle for poor travellers, in which they, and the animals that brought them, were meanly accommodated under the same roof. Now also there is seldom room for Christ in an inn. It will not be improper to observe, on this humiliating circumstance of our Lord’s birth in a stable, how, “through the whole course of his life, he despised the things most esteemed by men. For though he was the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God, </span>when he became man he chose to be born of parents in the meanest condition of life. Though he was <span class="ital">heir of all things, </span>he chose to be born in an inn, nay, in the stable of an inn, where, instead of a cradle, he was <span class="ital">laid in a manger. </span>The angels reported the good news of his birth, not to the rabbis and great men, but to shepherds, who, being plain honest people, were unquestionably good witnesses of what they heard and saw. When he grew up he wrought with his father as a carpenter. And afterward, while he executed the duties of his ministry, he was so poor that he <span class="ital">had not a place where to lay his head, </span>but lived on the bounty of his friends. Thus, by going before men in the thorny path of poverty and affliction, he has taught them to be contented with their lot in this life, however humble it may be.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/luke/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The fulness of time was now come, when God would send forth his Son, made of a woman, and made under the law. The circumstances of his birth were very mean. Christ was born at an inn; he came into the world to sojourn here for awhile, as at an inn, and to teach us to do likewise. We are become by sin like an outcast infant, helpless and forlorn; and such a one was Christ. He well knew how unwilling we are to be meanly lodged, clothed, or fed; how we desire to have our children decorated and indulged; how apt the poor are to envy the rich, and how prone the rich to disdain the poor. But when we by faith view the Son of God being made man and lying in a manger, our vanity, ambition, and envy are checked. We cannot, with this object rightly before us, seek great things for ourselves or our children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The city of David - Bethlehem, called the city of David because it was the place of his birth.
