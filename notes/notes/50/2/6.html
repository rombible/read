<a href="/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>). Hence it calls attention to the essential being of Christ, corresponding to the idea embodied in the name Jehovah, and thus implying what is more fully expressed in <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. (2) The word “form” (which, except for a casual use in <a href="/mark/16-12.htm" title="After that he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.">Mark 16:12</a>, is found only in this passage of the New Testament) is to be carefully distinguished from “fashion.” There can be no doubt that in classical Greek it describes the actual specific character, which (like the structure of a material substance) makes each being what it is; and this same idea is always conveyed in the New Testament by the compound words in which the root “form” is found (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>). (3) On the other hand, the word “fashion,” as in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm" title="And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.">1Corinthians 7:31</a> (“the fashion of this world passeth away”), denotes the mere outward appearance (which we frequently designate as “form”), as will be seen also in its compounds (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>). The two words are seen in juxtaposition in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a> (where see Notes). Hence, in this passage the “being in the form of God,” describes our Lord’s essential, and therefore eternal, being in the true nature of God; while the “taking on Him the form of a servant” similarly refers to His voluntary assumption of the true nature of man.<p>It should be noticed that, whereas in St. Paul’s earlier Epistles, in which he cared not “to know anything save Jesus Christ,” and “Him as crucified,” the main idea is always of our Lord as the mediator between man and God, yet in the later Epistles (as here, and in <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-19</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9-11</a>; to which we may add <a href="/context/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2-4</a>) stress is laid, sometimes (as in <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), on His gathering all things in heaven and earth unto Himself; sometimes, even more explicitly, on His partaking of the divine nature, and (as in <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>) of His possessing the divine attribute of creation. All this naturally leads up to the great declaration of His true and perfect Godhead in <a href="/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1-13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</span>—There are two main interpretations of this passage; first, the interpretation given in our version, which makes it simply an explanation and enforcement of the words “being in the form of God”; secondly, the translation <span class= "ital">thought it not a prize to be grasped at to be equal with God, </span>which begins in it the statement of our Lord’s voluntary self-humiliation, to be completed in the words, “but emptied Himself of glory.” The former preserves the literal translation of the original word “robbery;” the latter, in accordance with a not uncommon usage, makes it equivalent to “the thing snatched at,” and if this be allowed, has abundant examples in other writings to support the meaning thus given to the whole phrase. Either interpretation yields good sense and sound doctrine; neither does violence to the general context. But the latter is to be preferred; first (1) because it suits better the idea of the passage, which is to emphasise the reality of our Lord’s humility, and preserves the opposition implied in the “but” following; (2) because it has the great preponderance of the ancient Greek interpreters in its favour; (3) because it can, on the whole, appeal more confidently to ordinary usage of the phrase. The sense is that, being in the form of God, and therefore having equality with God, He set no store on that equality, as a glory to Himself, compared with the power of giving salvation to all men, which He is pleased to consider a new joy and glory.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who, being in the form of God - There is scarcely any passage in the New Testament which has given rise to more discussion than this. The importance of the passage on the question of the divinity of the Saviour will be perceived at once, and no small part of the point of the appeal by the apostle depends, as will be seen, in the fact that Paul regarded the Redeemer as equal with God. If he was truly divine, then his consenting to become a man was the most remarkable of all possible acts of humiliation. The word rendered "form" - &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;  morphe&#772; - occurs only in three places in the New Testament, and in each place is rendered "form." <a href="/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a>. In Mark it is applied to the form which Jesus assumed after his resurrection, and in which he appeared to two of his disciples on his way to Emmaus. "After that he appeared in another form unto two of them." This "form" was so unlike his usual appearance, that they did not know him. The word properly means, form, shape, bodily shape, especially a beautiful form, a beautiful bodily appearance - Passow. In <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, it is applied to the appearance of a servant - and took upon him the form of a servant;" that is, he was in the condition of a servant - or of the lowest condition. The word "form" is often applied to the gods by the classic writers, denoting their aspect or appearance when they became visible to people; see Cic. de Nat. Deor. ii. 2; Ovid, Meta. i. 37; Silius, xiii. 643; Xeno. Memora. iv; Aeneid, iv. 556, and other places cited by Wetstein, in loc. Hesychius explains it by &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  idea eidos. The word occurs often in the Septuagint:<p>(1) as the translation of the word &#1510;&#1497;&#1497; - Ziv - "splendour," <a href="/daniel/4-33.htm">Daniel 4:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9-10</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-28.htm">Daniel 7:28</a>;<p>(2) as the translation of the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;  tabniyth, structure, model, pattern - as in building, <a href="/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a>;<p>(3) as the translation of &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;  temuwnah, appearance, form, shape, image, likeness, <a href="/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>; see also Wisdom <a href="/job/18-1.htm">Job 18:1</a>.<p>The word can have here only one or two meanings, either:<p>(1) splendor, majesty, glory - referring to the honor which the Redeemer had, his power to work miracles, etc. - or.<p>(2) nature, or essence - meaning the same as &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  phusis, "nature," or &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  ousia, "being."<p>The first is the opinion adopted by Crellius, Grotius, and others, and substantially by Calvin. Calvin says, "The form of God here denotes majesty. For as a man is known from the appearance of his form, so the majesty which shines in God, is his figure. Or to use a more appropriate similitude, the form of a king consists of the external marks which indicate a king - as his scepter, diadem, coat of mail, attendants, throne, and other insignia of royalty; the form of a counsul is the toga, ivory chair, attending lictors, etc. Therefore Christ before the foundation of the world was in the form of God, because he had glory with the Father before the world was; <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. For in the wisdom of God, before he put on our nature, there was nothing humble or abject, but there was magnificence worthy of God." Commentary in loc. The second opinion is, that the word is equivalent to nature, or being; that is, that he was in the nature of God, or his mode of existence was that of God, or was divine. This is the opinion adopted by Schleusner (Lexicon); Prof. Stuart (Letters to Dr. Channing, p. 40); Doddridge, and by orthodox expositors in general, and seems to me to be the correct interpretation. In support of this interpretation, and in opposition to that which refers it to his power of working miracles, or his divine appearance when on earth, we may adduce the following considerations:<p>(1) The "form" here referred to must have been something before he became a man, or before he took upon him the form of a servant. It was something from which he humbled himself by making "himself of no reputation;" by taking upon himself "the form of a servant;" and by being made "in the likeness of men." Of course, it must have been something which existed when he had not the likeness of people; that is, before he became incarnate. He must therefore have had an existence before he appeared on earth as a man, and in that previous state of existence there must have been something which rendered it proper to say that he was "in the form of God."<p>(2) that it does not refer to any moral qualities, or to his power of working miracles on earth, is apparent from the fact that these were not laid aside. When did he divest himself of these in order that he might humble himself? There was something which he possessed which made it proper to say of him that he was "in the form of God," which he laid aside when he appeared in the form of a servant and in the likeness of human beings. But assuredly that could not have been his moral qualities, nor is there any conceivable sense in which it can be said that he divested himself of the power of working miracles in order that he might take upon himself the "form of a servant." All the miracles which he ever did were performed when he sustained the form of a servant, in his lowly and humble condition. These considerations make it certain that the apostle refers to a period before the incarnation. It may be added:<p>(3) that the phrase "form of God" is one that naturally conveys the idea that he was God. When it is said that he was "in the form of a servant," the idea is, that he was actually in a humble and depressed condition, and not merely that he appeared to be. Still it may be asked, what was the "form" which he had before his incarnation? What is meant by his having been then "in the form of God?" To these questions perhaps no satisfactory answer can be given. He himself speaks <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a> of "the glory which he had with the Father before the world was;" and the language naturally conveys the idea that there was then a manifestation of the divine nature through him, which in some measure ceased when he became incarnate; that there was some visible splendor and majesty which was then laid aside. What manifestation of his glory God may make in the heavenly world, of course, we cannot now fully understand. Nothing forbids us, however, to suppose that there is some such visible manifestation; some splendor and magnificence of God in the view of the angelic beings such as becomes the Great Sovereign of the universe - for he "dwells in light which no map can approach unto;" <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>. That glory, visible manifestation, or splendor, indicating the nature of God, it is here said that the Lord Jesus possessed before his incarnation.<p>Thought it not robbery to be equal with God - This passage, also, has given occasion to much discussion. Prof. Stuart renders it: "did not regard his equality with God as an object of solicitous desire;" that is, that though he was of a divine nature or condition, be did not eagerly seek to retain his equality with God, but took on him an humble condition - even that of a servant. Letters to Channing, pp. 88-92. That this is the correct rendering of the passage is apparent from the following considerations:<p>(1) It accords with the scope and design of the apostle's reasoning. His object is not to show, as our common translation would seem to imply, that he aspired to be equal with God, or that he did not regard it as an improper invasion of the prerogatives of God to be equal with him, but that he did not regard it, in the circumstances of the case, as an object to greatly desired or eagerly sought to retain his equality with God. Instead of retaining this by an earnest effort, or by a grasp which he was unwilling to relinquish, he chose to forego the dignity, and to assume the humble condition of a man.<p>(2) it accords better with the Greek than the common version. The word rendered "robbery" - &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  harpagmos - is found nowhere else in the New Testament, though the verb from which it is derived frequently occurs; <a href="/matthew/11-12.htm">Matthew 11:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19</a>; <a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>; <a href="/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29</a>; <a href="/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; Jde 1:23; <a href="/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>. The notion of violence, or seizing, or carrying away, enters into the meaning of the word in all these places. The word used here does not properly mean an act of robbery, but the thing robbed - the plunder - das Rauben (Passow), and hence something to be eagerly seized and appropriated. Schleusner; compare Storr, Opuscul. Acade. i. 322, 323. According to this, the meaning of the word here is, something to be seized and eagerly sought, and the sense is, that his being equal with God was not a thing to be anxiously retained. The phrase "thought it not," means "did not consider;" it was not judged to be a matter of such importance that it could not be dispensed with. The sense is, "he did not eagerly seize and tenaciously hold" as one does who seizes prey or spoil. So Rosenmuller, Schleusner, Bloomfield, Stuart, and others understand it.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Translate, "Who subsisting (or existing, namely, originally: the Greek is not the simple substantive verb, 'to be') in the form of God (the divine essence is not meant: but the external self-manifesting characteristics of God, the form shining forth from His glorious essence). The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of God'; as 'the form of a servant' (Php 2:7), which is in contrasted opposition to it, takes for granted the existence of His human nature, so 'the form of God' takes for granted His divine nature [Bengel], Compare Joh 5:37; 17:5; Col 1:15, 'Who is the IMAGE of the invisible God' at a time before 'every creature,' 2Co 4:4, esteemed (the same Greek verb as in Php 2:3) His being on an equality with God no (act of) robbery" or self-arrogation; claiming to one's self what does not belong to him. Ellicott, Wahl, and others have translated, "A thing to be grasped at," which would require the Greek to be harpagma, whereas harpagmos means the act of seizing. So harpagmos means in the only other passage where it occurs, Plutarch [On the Education of Children, 120]. The same insuperable objection lies against Alford's translation, "He regarded not as self-enrichment (that is, an opportunity for self-exaltation) His equality with God." His argument is that the antithesis (Php 2:7) requires it, "He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement, or emptying Himself." But the antithesis is not between His being on an equality with God, and His emptying Himself; for He never emptied Himself of the fulness of His Godhead, or His "BEING on an equality with God"; but between His being "in the FORM (that is, the outward glorious self-manifestation) of God," and His "taking on Him the form of a servant," whereby He in a great measure emptied Himself of His precedent "form," or outward self-manifesting glory as God. Not "looking on His own things" (Php 2:4), He, though existing in the form of God, He esteemed it no robbery to be on an equality with God, yet made Himself of no reputation. "Being on an equality with God, is not identical with subsisting in the form of God"; the latter expresses the external characteristics, majesty, and beauty of the Deity, which "He emptied Himself of," to assume "the form of a servant"; the former, "His being," or NATURE, His already existing STATE OF EQUALITY with God, both the Father and the Son having the same ESSENCE.

From openly showing equal majesty with whom he did not for a time abstain, in that he could reckon this robbery, as if such majesty were that which did not agree to his nature, ever presupposing this inherent right, to his great condescension, or abasing himself, which follows as the term to which: or, he resolved for a time not to show himself in that glory which was his own right, but freely condescended to the veiling of it. He did not really forego (neither was it possible he should) any thing of his Divine glory, being the Son of God still, without any robbery or rapine, equal to his Father in power and glory, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/10-33.htm" title="The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.">John 10:33</a> <a href="/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1Jo 5:7</a>,20</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thought it not robbery; </span> Paul doth not say, (as the Arians of old would pervert his sense), he robbed not, or snatched not, held not fast equality with God; or, (as the Socinians since), Christ thought not to do this robbery to God, or commit this rape upon God, so as that he should be equal to him, but acknowledged he had it of the free gift of God, chopping in the adversative particle, <span class="ital">but, </span> where it really is not: whereas we read not in the sacred text, he <span class="ital">thought not to do this robbery, </span> but, he <span class="ital">thought it not robbery</span> to be equal to God; which two are vastly different, even as much as to have the Godhead by usurpation, and to have it by nature. In the former it is, q.d. Christ did not rob or snatch away the equality; in the latter, the equality which Christ had with God, he thought it no robbery; he reputed not the empire he might have always continued in the exercise of, equal with the Father, as a thing usurped, or taken by force (as one doth hold that he hath taken by spoil, making show of it). For when he had said he had subsisted in the form of God, he could (before he condescended) say also, he was equal to God, i.e. the Father, without any robbery, rapine, or usurpation. And if Socinus urge that it is absurd and false in any sense to say, God thought he had robbed, or taken by robbery, the Divine essence; then this contradictory, God thought not he took by robbery the Divine essence, is rational and true; as when it is said, God cannot lie, or God changeth not, as <span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1 Samuel 15:29</a> <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm" title="For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, said the LORD.">Isaiah 55:8</a> <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm" title="For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.">Malachi 3:6</a></span>. What things are denied of God, do not imply the opposites are affirmed of him. The particle <span class="ital">but, </span> which follows in its proper place before <span class="ital">made himself of no reputation, </span> may be fairly joined with this sense. For if Christ should know that by rapine and unjust usurpation he was equal to God, (as likely the attempt to be so was the sin of our first parents, which robbery of theirs Christ came to expiate), he had not emptied himself, nor vouchsafed to abase himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To be equal with God; </span> neither is Christ said to be equal to God only in respect of his works, (which yet argue the same cause and principle, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>,21,23,26,27 10:37</span>), but absolutely, he thought it not robbery to be altogether equal with God, as subsisting in the same nature and essence, the original phrase connoting an exact parity. All the things of Christ (though he chose to have some of them veiled for a time) are equal to God; so some expound the neuter plural emphatically, (as usual amongst the Greeks), to answer the masculine singular foregoing, to express the ineffable sameness of the nature and essence of the Divine subsistents. It may be read: He counted it no robbery that those things which are his own should be equal to God, i.e. the Father; or rather, that he himself should in all things be equal or peer to God. For had Christ been only equal by a delegated power from God, why should the Jews have consulted to kill him, for making himself equal with God? Which with them was all one as to make himself God, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a> 10:33</span>. But that he spake of his eternal generation, as owning him for his own Father, with whom he did work miracles, even as the Father did in his own name, by his own power, of himself, for his own glory: neither will the evangelist’s saying: <span class="ital">The Son can do nothing of himself, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a></span>, infer an inequality with the Father, when what he doth is equally perfect in power and glory with the Father’s, whence, as son, he hath it by nature. For (looking lower) though every son receives from his father human nature, yet he is not less a man than his father, or his father more a man than he; the son having a being of the same perfection which is naturally in both. However the Father, to whom Christ is in subordination as the Son, and in office a servant, undertaking the work of mediation, may be said to be greater than the Son, that can only be understood with respect to the order of their working, if we compare texts, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/14-28.htm" title="You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.">John 14:28</a> 16:13-15</span>. Neither, when Christ accounted it not robbery to be equal with God, is he said (as the adversaries urge) to be equal to himself, but to another person, viz. God the Father. Things may be equal which are so diverse, that yet they may be one in some common respect wherein they agree: wherefore when Christ is said to be equal with the Father, he is distinguished from him in person and subsistence, yet not in essence, wherein it is his due to be his equal, and therefore one. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/philippians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who being in the form of God,....

This form is to be understood, not of any shape or figure of him; for as such is not to be seen, it is not to be supposed of him; or any accidental form, for there are no accidents in God, whatever is in God, is God; he is nothing but nature and essence, he is the , the Jehovah, I am what I am; and so is his Son, which is, and was, and is to come, the fountain of all created beings nor does it intend any outward representation and resemblance of him, such as in kings; who, because of the honour and dignity they are raised unto, the authority and power they have, and because of the glory and majesty they are arrayed with, are called gods: nor does it design the state and condition Christ appeared in here on earth, having a power to work miracles, heal diseases, and dispossess devils, for the manifestation of his glory; and so might be said to be in the form of God, as Moses for doing less miracles is said to be a God unto Pharaoh; since this account does not regard Christ; as he was on earth in human nature, but what he was antecedent to the assumption of it; or otherwise his humility and condescension in becoming man, and so mean, will not appear: but this phrase, "the form of God", is to be understood of the nature and essence of God, and describes Christ as he was from all eternity; just as the form of a servant signifies that he was really a servant, and the fashion of a man in which he was found means that he was truly and really man; so his being in the form of God intends that he was really and truly God; that he partook of the same nature with the Father, and was possessed of the same glory: from whence it appears, that he was in being before his incarnation; that he existed as a distinct person from God his Father, in whose form he was, and that as a divine person, or as truly God, being in the glorious form, nature, and essence of God; and that there is but one form of God, or divine nature and essence, common to the Father and the Son, and also to the Spirit; so that they are not three Gods, but one God: what the form of God is, the Heathens themselves (g) say cannot be comprehended nor seen, and so not to be inquired after; and they use the same word the apostle does here (h): and now Christ being in this glorious form, or having the same divine nature with the Father, with all the infinite and unspeakable glories of it, <p>thought it no robbery to be equal with God; the Father; for if he was in the same form, nature, and essence, he must be equal to him, as he is; for he has the same perfections, as eternity, omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, immutability, and self-existence: hence he has the same glorious names, as God, the mighty God, the true God, the living God, God over all, Jehovah, the Lord of glory, &amp;c. the same works of creation and providence are ascribed to him, and the same worship, homage, and honour given him: to be "in the form of God", and to be "equal with God", signify the same thing, the one is explanative of the other: and this divine form and equality, or true and proper deity, he did not obtain by force and rapine, by robbery and usurpation, as Satan attempted to do, and as Adam by his instigation also affected; and so the mind of a wicked man, as Philo the Jew says (i), being a lover of itself and impious,  , "thinks itself to be equal with God", a like phrase with this here used; but Christ enjoyed this equality by nature; he thought, he accounted, he knew he had it this way; and he held it hereby, and of right, and not by any unlawful means; and he reckoned that by declaring and showing forth his proper deity, and perfect equality with the Father, he robbed him of no perfection; the same being in him as in the Father, and the same in the Father as in him; that he did him no injury, nor deprived him of any glory, or assumed that to himself which did not belong to him: as for the sense which some put upon the words, that he did not "affect", or "greedily catch" at deity; as the phrase will not admit of it, so it is not true in fact; he did affect deity, and asserted it strongly, and took every proper opportunity of declaring it, and in express terms affirmed he was the Son of God; and in terms easy to be understood declared his proper deity, and his unity and equality with the Father; required the same faith in himself as in the Father, and signified that he that saw the one, saw the other, <a href="/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a> <a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>. Others give this as the sense of them, that he did not in an ostentatious way show forth the glory of his divine nature, but rather hid it; it is true, indeed, that Christ did not seek, but carefully shunned vain glory and popular applause; and therefore often after having wrought a miracle, would charge the persons on whom it was wrought, or the company, or his disciples, not to speak of it; this he did at certain times, and for certain reasons; yet at other times we find, that he wrought miracles to manifest forth his glory, and frequently appeals to them as proofs of his deity and Messiahship: and besides, the apostle is speaking not of what he was, or did in his incarnate state, but of what he was and thought himself to be, before he became man; wherefore the above sense is to be preferred as the genuine one, <p>(g) Socraticus, Xenophon, &amp; Aristo Chius, apud Minuc.

Then He was forsooth, and that objectively, not merely in God’s self-consciousness—as the not yet incarnate Son (<a href="/context/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;...">Romans 1:3-4</a>; <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>), according to John as <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>—with God, in the fellowship of the glory of God (comp. <a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>).

The explanation of <span class="greekheb">φύσις</span> was promoted among the Fathers by the opposition to Arius and a number of other heretics, as Chrysostom adduces them in triumph; hence, also, there is much polemical matter in them. For the later controversy with the Socinians, see Calovius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπάρχων</span>] designating more expressly than <span class="greekheb">ὤν</span> the relation of the <span class="ital">subsisting state</span> (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>; <a href="/luke/7-25.htm" title="But what went you out for to see?

The <span class="ital">time</span> is that of the <span class="ital">pre-human</span> existence. See above on <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span>. Those who understand it as referring to His <span class="ital">human</span> existence (comp. <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>) think of the divine majesty, which Jesus manifested both <span class="ital">by word and deed</span> (Ambrosiaster, Luther, Erasmus, Heinrichs, Krause, <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. p. 33, and others), especially by His <span class="ital">miracles</span> (Grotius, Clericus); while Wetstein and Michaelis even suggest that the <span class="ital">transfiguration on the mount</span> is intended. It would be more in harmony with the context to understand the possession of the complete divine image (without arbitrarily limiting this, by preference possibly, to the <span class="ital">moral</span> attributes alone, as de Wette and Schneckenburger do)—a possession which Jesus (“as the God-pervaded man,” Philippi) had (<span class="ital">potentialiter</span>) <span class="ital">from the</span> very <span class="ital">beginning</span> of His earthly life, but in a <span class="ital">latent</span> manner, without manifesting it. This view, however, would land them in difficulty with regard to the following <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκένωσε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and expose them to the risk of inserting limiting clauses at variance with the literal import of the passage; see below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο τὸ εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span>] In order to the right explanation, it is to be observed: (1) that the emphasis is placed on <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμόν</span>, and therefore (2) that <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span> cannot be something essentially different from <span class="greekheb">ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὑπάρχειν</span>, but must in substance denote the same thing, namely, the divine <span class="ital">habitus</span> of Christ, which is expressed, as to its <span class="ital">form of appearance</span>, by <span class="greekheb">ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὑπάρχ</span>., and, as to its internal <span class="ital">nature</span>, by <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span>;[96] (3) lastly, that <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμός</span> does not mean <span class="ital">praeda</span>, or <span class="ital">that which is seized on</span> (which would be <span class="greekheb">ἁρπάγιμον</span>, Callim. <span class="ital">Cer</span>. 9; Pallad, <span class="ital">ep</span>. 87; Philop. 79; or <span class="greekheb">ἅρπαγμα</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἅρπασμα</span>, and might also be <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγή</span>), or <span class="ital">that which one forcibly snatches to himself</span> (Hofmann and older expositors); but actively: <span class="ital">robbing, making booty</span>. In this sense, which is <span class="greekheb">ὰ</span> <span class="ital">priori</span> probable from the termination of the word which usually serves to indicate an <span class="ital">action</span>, it is used, beyond doubt, in the only profane passage in which it is extant, Plut. <span class="ital">de pueror. educ</span>. 15 (<span class="ital">Mor</span>. p. 12 A): <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοὺς μὲν Θήβῃσι καὶ τοὺς Ἠλίδι φευκτέον ἔρωτας καὶ τὸν ἐκ Κρήτης καλούμενον ἁρπαγμόν</span>, where it denotes the Cretan kidnapping of children. It is accordingly to be explained: <span class="ital">Not as a robbing did He consider</span>[97] <span class="ital">the being equal with God, i.e</span>. He did not place it under the point of view of making booty, as if it was, with respect to its exertion of activity, to consist <span class="ital">in His seizing what did not belong to Him</span>. In opposition to Hofmann’s earlier logical objection (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 149) that one cannot consider the <span class="ital">being</span> as a <span class="ital">doing</span>, comp. <a href="/1_timothy/6-5.htm" title="Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself.">1 Timothy 6:5</a>; and see Hofmann himself, who has now recognised the linguistically correct explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμός</span>, but leaves the object of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΡΠΆΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span> indefinite, though the latter must necessarily be something that belongs to <span class="ital">others</span>, consequently a <span class="ital">foreign</span> possession.

We have still to notice (1) that this <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο</span> corresponds exactly to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΤᾺ ἙΑΥΤῶΝ ΣΚΟΠΟῦΝΤΕς</span></span></span> (<a href="/philippians/2-4.htm" title="Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.">Php 2:4</a>), as well as to its contrast <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΑΥΤῸΝ ἘΚΈΝΩΣΕ</span></span></span> in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a> (see on <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a>); and (2) that the <span class="ital">aorist</span> <span class="greekheb">ἡγήσατο</span>, indicating a definite point of time, undoubtedly, according to the connection (see the contrast, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ ἙΑΥΤῸΝ ἘΚΈΝΩΣΕ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>), transports the reader to <span class="ital">that moment, when the pre-existing Christ was on the point of coming into the world with the being equal to God</span>. Had He then thought: “When I shall have come into the world, I will seize to myself, by means of my equality with God, power and dominion, riches, pleasure, worldly glory,” then He would have acted the part of <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγεῖσθαι τὸ εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span>; to which, however, He did not consent, but consented, on the contrary, to self-renunciation, etc. It is accordingly self-evident that the supposed case of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΡΠΑΓΜΌς</span></span></span> is not conceived as an action of the pre-existing Christ (as Richard Schmidt objects), but is put as connecting itself with His appearance on earth. The <span class="ital">reflection</span>, of which the pre-existent Christ is, according to our passage, represented as capable, even in presence of the will of God (see below, <span class="greekheb">γενόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπήκοος</span>), although the apostle has only conceived it as an abstract possibility and expressed it in an anthropopathic mode of presentation, is decisive in favour of the <span class="ital">personal</span> pre-existence; but in this pre-existence the Son appears as <span class="ital">subordinate</span> to the Father, as He does throughout the entire New Testament, although this is not (as Beyschlag objects) at variance with the Trinitarian equality of essence in the Biblical sense. By the <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγεῖσθαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., if it had taken place, He would have wished to <span class="ital">relieve</span> Himself from this subordination.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The linguistic correctness and exact apposite correlation of the whole of this explanation, which harmonizes with <a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>,[100] completely exclude the interpretation, which is traditional but in a linguistic point of view is quite incapable of proof, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΡΠΑΓΜΌς</span></span></span>, either in itself or by metonymy (in which van Hengel again appeals quite inappropriately to the analogy of <a href="/james/1-2.htm" title="My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;">Jam 1:2</a>, <a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2 Peter 3:15</a>), means <span class="ital">praeda</span> or <span class="ital">res rapienda</span>. With this interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμός</span>, the idea of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἾΝΑΙ ἼΣΑ ΘΕῷ</span></span></span> has either been rightly taken as practically <span class="ital">identical</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὑπάρχειν</span>, or <span class="ital">not</span>. (A) In the <span class="ital">former</span> case, the point of comparison of the figurative <span class="ital">praeda</span> has been very differently defined: <span class="ital">either</span>, that Christ regarded the existence equal with God, not as a something usurped and illegitimate, but as something <span class="ital">natural</span> to Him, and that, therefore, He did not fear to lose it through His humiliation (Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Augustine, and other Fathers; see Wetstein and J. B. Lightfoot); comp. Beza, Calvin, Estius, and others, who, however, give to the conception a different turn;[101] <span class="ital">or</span>, that He did not desire <span class="ital">pertinaciously to retain for Himself</span> this equality with God, as a robber his booty, or as an unexpected gain (Ambrosiaster, Castalio, Vatablus, Kesler, and others; and recently, Hoelemann, Tholuck, Reuss, Liebner, Schmid, Wiesinger, Gess, Messner, Grimm; comp. also Usteri, p. 314);[102] <span class="ital">or</span>, that He did not <span class="ital">conceal it</span>, as a prey (Matthies); <span class="ital">or</span>, that He did not desire <span class="ital">to display it triumphantly</span>, as a conqueror his spoils (Luther, Erasmus, Cameron, Vatablus, Piscator, Grotius, Calovius, Quenstedt, Wolf, and many others, including Michaelis, Zachariae, Rosenmüller, Heinrichs, Flatt, Rheinwald);[103] whilst others (Wetstein the most strangely, but also Usteri and several) <span class="ital">mix up</span> very <span class="ital">various</span> points of comparison. The very circumstance, however, that there exists so much divergence in these attempts at explanation, shows how arbitrarily men have endeavoured to supply a <span class="ital">modal definition</span> for <span class="greekheb">ἁρπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡγήσ</span>., which is not at all suggested by the text.—(B) In the <span class="ital">second</span> case, in which a <span class="ital">distinction is made</span> between <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὑπάρχειν</span>, it is explained: <span class="ital">non rapinam duxit</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">non rapiendum sibi duxit</span>, or directly, <span class="ital">non rapuit</span> (Musculus, Er. Schmidt, Elsner, Clericus, Bengel, and many others, including am Ende, Martini, Krause, <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. p. 31, Schrader, Stein, Rilliet, van Hengel, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Ernesti, Raebiger, Schneckenburger, Ewald, Weiss, Schenkel, Philippi, Thomasius, Beyschlag, Kahnis, Rich.

Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. p. 151) makes the thought be supplied, that it was not in the aim of the work of redemption befitting that Christ should at the very outset receive divine honour, and that, if He <span class="ital">had taken</span> it to Himself, it would have been a <span class="ital">seizure</span>, an usurpation. But as <span class="greekheb">ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὑπ</span>. already involves the divine essence,[107] and as <span class="greekheb">ἴσα εἶναι Θεῷ</span> has no distinctive more special definition in any manner climactic (comp. Pfleiderer), Chrysostom has estimated this whole mode of explanation very justly: <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἦν Θεός</span>, <span class="greekheb">πῶς εἶχεν ἁρπάσαι</span>; <span class="greekheb">καὶ πῶς οὐκ ἀπερινόητον τοῦτο</span>; <span class="greekheb">τίς γὰρ ἂν εἴποι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ὁ δεῖνα ἄνθρωπος ὤν οὐχ ἥρπασε τὸ εἶναι ἄνθρωπος</span>; <span class="greekheb">πῶς γὰρ ἄν τις ὅπερ ἐστὶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἁρπάσειεν</span>. Moreover, in harmony with the thought and the state of the case, Paul must have expressed himself conversely: <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἴσα Θεῷ ὑπάρχων οὐχ ἁρπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἠγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἶναι ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ</span>, so as to add to the idea of the equality of <span class="ital">nature</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἴσα</span>), by way of climax, that of the same <span class="ital">form of appearance</span> (<span class="greekheb">μορφή</span>), of the divine <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With respect to <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span>, it is to be observed, (1) that <span class="greekheb">ἴσα</span> is <span class="ital">adverbial: in like manner</span>, as we find it, although less frequently, in Attic writers (Thuc. iii. 14; Eur. <span class="ital">Or</span>. 880 <span class="ital">al.;</span> comp. <span class="greekheb">ὁμοῖα</span>, Lennep. <span class="ital">ad Phalar</span>. 108), and often in the later Greek, and in the LXX.

In the discussion of this <span class="ital">crux interpretum</span> it is impossible, within our limits, to do more than give a brief outline of the chief legitimate interpretations, laying special emphasis on that which we prefer and giving our reasons. As regards literature, a good account of the older exegesis is given by Tholuck, <span class="ital">Disputatio Christologica</span>, pp. 2–10. Franke (in Meyer5) gives a very full list of modern discussions. In addition to commentaries and the various works on Biblical Theology, the following discussions are specially important: Räbiger, <span class="ital">De Christologia Paulina</span>, pp. 76–85; R. Schmidt, <span class="ital">Paulinische Christologie</span>, p. 163 ff.; W. Grimm, <span class="ital">Zw. Th</span>[97], xvi., 1, p. 33 ff.; Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">ibid.</span>, xxvii., 4, p. 498 ff.; W. Weiffenbach, <span class="ital">Zur Auslegung d. Stelle Phil.</span>, ii. 5–11 (Karlsruhe, 1884); E. H. Gifford, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, v., vol. 4, p. 161 ff., 241 ff. [since published separately]; Somerville, <span class="ital">St. Paul’s Conception of Christ</span>, p. 188 ff. It may be useful to note certain cautions which must be observed if the Apostle’s thought is to be truly grasped. (<span class="ital">a</span>) This is not a discussion in technical theology. Paul does not speculate on the great problems of the nature of Christ. The elaborate theories reared on this passage and designated “kenotic” would probably have surprised the Apostle. Paul is dealing with a question of practical ethics, the marvellous condescension and unselfishness of Christ, and he brings into view the several stages in this process as facts of history either presented to men’s experience or else inferred from it. [At the same time, as J. Weiss notes (<span class="ital">Th. LZ</span>[98], 1899, col. 263), the careful rhetorical structure of the passage (two strophes of four lines) shows that the thought has been patiently elaborated.] (<span class="ital">b</span>) It is beside the mark to apply the canons of philosophic terminology to the Apostle’s language. Much trouble would be saved if interpreters instead of minutely investigating the refinements of Greek metaphysics, on the assumption that they are present here, were to ask themselves, “What other terms could the Apostle have used to express his conceptions?” (<span class="ital">c</span>) It is futile to attempt to make Paul’s thought in this passage fit in with any definite and systematic scheme of Christology such as the “Heavenly Man,” etc. This only hampers interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[97] <span class="ital">Zeitschr. f. wissenschaftl.

We have in this passage a N.T. counterpart to the O.T. revelation of Messiah’s “coming to do the will of His God” (<a href="/context/psalms/40-6.htm" title="Sacrifice and offering you did not desire; my ears have you opened: burnt offering and sin offering have you not required....">Psalm 40:6-8</a>, interpreted <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">being</span>] The Greek word slightly indicates that He not only “<span class="ital">was</span>,” but “<span class="ital">already was</span>,” in a state antecedent to and independent of the action to be described. R.V. margin has “Gr. <span class="ital">originally being</span>”; but the American Revisers dissent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the form of God</span>] The word rendered “<span class="ital">form</span>” is <span class="ital">morphê</span>. This word, unlike our “form” in its popular meaning, connotes <span class="ital">reality along with appearance</span>, or in other words denotes an appearance which is <span class="ital">manifestation</span>. It thus differs from the word (<span class="ital">schêma</span>) rendered “<span class="ital">fashion</span>” in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Php 2:8</a> below; where see note.

(See further, the next note below, and on <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a>.) “Though [<span class="ital">morphê</span>] is not the same as [<span class="ital">ousia, essence</span>], yet the possession of the [<span class="ital">morphê</span>] involves participation in the [<span class="ital">ousia</span>] also, for [<span class="ital">morphê</span>] implies not the external accidents [only?] but the essential attributes” (Lightfoot).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thought</span>] The glorious Person is viewed as (speaking in the forms of human conception) engaged in an act of reflection and resolve.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">robbery</span>] The Greek word occurs only here in the Greek Scriptures, and only once (in Plutarch, cent. 2) in secular Greek writers. Its form suggests the meaning of a <span class="ital">process</span> or <span class="ital">act</span> of grasp or seizure. But similar forms in actual usage are found to take readily the meaning of the <span class="ital">result</span>, or <span class="ital">material</span>, of an act or process. “An invader’s or plunderer’s <span class="ital">prize</span>” would thus fairly represent the word here. This interpretation is adopted and justified by Bp Lightfoot here. R.V. reads “<span class="ital">a prize</span>,” and in the margin “Gr. <span class="ital">a thing to be grasped</span>.” Liddell and Scott render, “<span class="ital">a matter of robbery</span>,” which is substantially the same; Bp Ellicott, “<span class="ital">a thing to be seized on</span>, or <span class="ital">grasped at</span>.”—The context is the best interpreter of the practical bearing of the word. In that context it appears that the Lord’s view of His Equality (see below) was <span class="ital">not</span> such as to <span class="ital">withstand</span> His gracious and mysterious Humiliation for our sakes, while yet the conditions of His Equality were such as to <span class="ital">enhance the wonder</span> and merit of that Humiliation to the utmost. Accordingly the phrase before us, to suit the context, (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">must not</span> imply that He deemed Equality an unlawful possession, a thing which it would be robbery to claim, as some expositors, ancient and modern, have in error explained the words (see Alford’s note here, and St Chrysostom on this passage at large); (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">must</span> imply that His thought about the Equality was one of supremely <span class="ital">exemplary kindness</span> towards us. These conditions are satisfied by the paraphrase—“He dealt with His true and rightful Equality not as a thing held anxiously, and only for Himself, as the gains of force or fraud are held, but as a thing in regard of which a most gracious sacrifice and surrender was possible, for us and our salvation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The A.V., along with many interpreters, appears to understand the Greek word as nearly equal to “<span class="ital">usurpation</span>”; as if to say, “He knew it was His just and rightful possession to be equal with God, and yet” &c. But the context and the Greek phraseology are unfavourable to this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to be equal with God</span>] R.V., <span class="bld">to be on an equality with God</span>, a phrase which perhaps better conveys what the original words suggest, that the reference is to equality of <span class="ital">attributes</span> rather than <span class="ital">person</span> (Lightfoot). The glorious Personage in view is not another and independent God, of rival power and glory, but the Christ of God, as truly and fully Divine as the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let us remember that these words occur not in a polytheistic reverie, but in the Holy Scriptures, which everywhere are jealous for the prerogative of the Lord God, and that they come from the pen of a man whose Pharisaic monotheism sympathized with this jealousy to the utmost. May it not then be asked, how—in any, way other than direct assertion, as in <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>–the true and proper Deity of Christ could be more plainly stated?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word “God” on the other hand is here used manifestly with a certain distinctiveness of the Father. Christian orthodoxy, collecting the whole Scripture evidence, sees in this a testimony not to the view (e.g. of Arius, cent. 4) that the Son is God only in a secondary and inferior sense, but that the Father is the eternal, true, and necessary Fountain of the eternal, true, and necessary Godhead of the Son.—For this use of the word God, see e.g. <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-14.htm" title="The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.

The Divine nature had infinite beauty in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty. That beauty was the <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">form of God</span>, as in man beauty shines forth from the sound constitution and elegant symmetry of his body, whether it has or has not any one to look at it. Man himself is seen by his <span class="ital">form;</span> so God and His glorious Majesty. This passage furnishes an excellent proof of the Divinity of Christ from this very fact; for as <span class="ital">the form of a servant</span> does not signify the human nature itself—for the form of a servant was not perpetual, but the human nature is to continue for ever—yet nevertheless it takes for granted the existence of the human nature: so the <span class="ital">form of God</span> is not the Divine nature, nor is the <span class="ital">being on an equality with God</span> the Divine nature; but yet He, who <span class="ital">was subsisting</span> in the form of God, and who might have been on an <span class="ital">equality with God</span>, is God. Moreover the <span class="ital">form of God</span> is used rather than the <span class="ital">form of the Lord</span>, as presently after <span class="ital">on an equality with God:</span> because <span class="ital">God</span> is more an absolute word, <span class="ital">Lord</span> involves a relation to inferiors. The Son of God <span class="ital">subsisted</span> in that form of God from eternity: and when He came in the flesh He did not cease to be in that form, but rather, so far as the human nature is concerned, He began to <span class="ital">subsist</span> in it: and when He was in that form, by His own peculiar pre-eminence itself as Lord, it was entirely in His power, even according to His human nature, so soon as He assumed it, to be <span class="ital">on an equality with God</span>, to adopt a mode of life and outward distinctions, which would correspond to His dignity, that He might be received and treated by all creatures as their Lord; but He acted differently.—<span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο</span>, <span class="ital">He did not regard it a thing to be eagerly caught at as a prey</span>) <span class="ital">as a spoil</span>. Those, to whom any opportunity of sudden advantage is presented, are usually eager in other cases to fly upon it and quickly to lay hold of it, without having any respect to others, and determinately to use and enjoy it. Hence <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαλέα</span>, with Eustathius, means, <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάνυ περισπούδαστα</span>, <span class="ital">the things which a man may with all eagerness snatch for his own use, and may claim as his own:</span> and the phrases occur, <span class="greekheb">ἅρπαγμα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἕρμαιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">εὕρημα</span>, <span class="greekheb">νομίζειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ποεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡγεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἁρπάζειν</span>. E. Schmidius and G. Raphelius have collected examples from Heliodorus and Polybius. But Christ, though He might have been <span class="ital">on an equality with God</span>, did not snatch at it, did not regard it as spoil.[17] He did not suddenly use that power; compare <a href="/psalms/69-5.htm" title="O God, you know my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from you.">Psalm 69:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-5.htm" title="For God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.">Genesis 3:5</a>, etc. This <span class="ital">feeling</span> on His part is at the same time indicated by the verb <span class="greekheb">ἡγεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to regard, to treat it as</span>. It would not have been <span class="ital">robbery</span> (rapina), if He had used His own right; but He abstained from doing so, just as if it had been <span class="ital">robbery</span>. A similar phrase at <a href="/2_corinthians/11-8.htm" title="I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.">2 Corinthians 11:8</a>, where see the note, may be compared with it.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ εἶναι ἶσα Θεῷ</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἶσα</span>, the accusative used adverbially, as happens often in Job, <span class="ital">on an equality with</span> and in a manner suitable to God. <span class="ital">To be on an equality with God</span>, implies His <span class="ital">fulness</span> and <span class="ital">exaltation</span>, as is evident from the double antithesis, <a href="/context/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:...">Php 2:7-8</a>, <span class="ital">He emptied and humbled Himself</span>. The article, without which <span class="greekheb">μορφὴν</span> is put, makes now an emphatic addition [Epitasis]. It is not therefore wonderful, that He never called Himself <span class="ital">God</span>, rather rarely <span class="ital">the Son of God</span>, generally the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of man</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[17] Many think rightly, from a passage of Plutarch, quoted by Wetstein, that <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸς</span> signifies the <span class="ital">act</span> by which anything is greedily seized, and the <span class="ital">desire</span> which leads to it; but that <span class="greekheb">ἀρπάγμα</span>, having a neuter ending, indicates the <span class="ital">object</span> desired, the <span class="ital">thing</span> seized, the prey. Drusius, in Crit. S.S., Lond., tries to show that <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸς</span>, as well as <span class="greekheb">ἁρπάγμα</span>, though both strictly signifying an <span class="ital">act, may</span> signify the thing which is the <span class="ital">object</span> of the act. Wahl renders <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸς</span>, “res cupidè arripienda et necessario usurpanda.” So Neander, “Conscious of Divinity, He did not <span class="ital">eagerly retain</span> equality with God for the mere exhibition of it, but emptied Himself of the outward attributes and glory of it.” The antithesis favours this view. However, there seems no very valid argument against <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸς</span> being taken in the <span class="ital">strict</span> sense, as Engl. V., ‘<span class="ital">thought</span>’ the being on an equality with God no act of ‘<span class="ital">robbery</span>,’ or arrogation of what did not belong to Him. It is true the antithesis, as Olshausen argues, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐκένωσεν</span>, may seem to suit better Wahl’s rendering. But <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμὸς</span>, in the only passage where it occurs, Plut. de puer. educ., 120, means <span class="ital">raptus</span> or <span class="ital">actio rapiendi</span>, not <span class="ital">res rapta</span>. It is only by metonymy it can be made even <span class="ital">res rapienda</span>. As to the antithesis, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span> plainly means, <span class="ital">And yet:</span> Though having been in the form of God, etc., yet, etc.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, being in the form of God</span>. The word rendered "being" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) means, as R.V. in margin, being originally. It looks back to the time before the Incarnation, when the Word, the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, was with God (comp. <a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>). What does the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> form, mean here? It occurs twice in this passage - Ver. 6, "form of God;" and Ver. 7, "form of a servant;" it is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> fashion, in Ver. 8. In the Aristotelian philosophy (<span class="accented">vide</span> ' De Anima,' 2:1, 2) <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>. is used almost in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as that which makes a thing to be what it is, the sum of its essential attributes: it is the form, as the expression of those essential attributes, the permanent, constant form; not the fleeting, outward <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, or fashion. St. Paul seems to make a somewhat similar distinction between the two words. Thus in <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> (or its derivatives) is used of the deep inner change of heart, the change which is described in Holy Scripture as a new creation; while <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used of the changeful fashion of the world and agreement with it (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>; <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). Then, when St. Paul tells us that Christ Jesus, being first in the form of God, took the form of a servant, the meaning must be that he possessed originally the essential attributes of Deity, and assumed in addition the essential attributes of humanity. He was perfect God; he became perfect (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). For a fuller discussion of the meanings of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, see Bishop Lightfoot's detached note ('Philippians,' p. 127), and Archbishop Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 70. Thought it not robbery to be equal with God; R.V. "counted it not a prize [margin, 'a thing to be grasped'] to be on an equality with God." These two renderings represent two conflicting interpretations of this difficult passage. Do the words mean that Christ asserted his essential Godhead ("thought it not robbery to be equal with God," as A.V.), or that he did not cling to the glory of the Divine majesty ("counted it not a prize," as R.V.)? Both statements are true in fact. The grammatical form of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which properly implies  an action or process, favors the first view, which seems to be adopted by most of the ancient versions and by most of the Latin Fathers. On the other hand, the form of the word does not exclude the passive interpretation; many words of the same termination have a passive meaning, and <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> itself is used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria, and a writer in the 'Catena Possini' on <a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42</a> (the three passages are quoted by Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">loco</span>). The Greek Fathers (as Chrysostom <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.) generally adopt this interpretation. And the context seems to require it. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points to an act, the act of abnegation; not to a state, the continued assertion. The conjunction "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>) implies that the two sentences are opposed to one another. He did not grasp, but, on the contrary, he emptied himself. The first interpretation involves the tacit insertion of "nevertheless;" he asserted his equality, but nevertheless, etc. And the whole stress is laid on the Lord's humility and unselfishness. It is true that this second interpretation does not so distinctly assert the divinity of our Lord, already sufficiently asserted in the first clause, "being in the form of God." But it implies it. Not to grasp at equality with God would not be an instance of humility, but merely the absence of mad impiety, in one who was not himself Divine. On the whole, then, we prefer the second interpretation. Though he was born the beginning in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God as a thing to be grasped, a prize to be tenaciously retained. Not so good is the view of Meyer and others: "Jesus Christ, when he found himself in the heavenly mode of existence of Divine glory, did not permit himself the thought of using his equality with God for the purpose of seizing possessions and honor for himself on earth." The R.V. rendering of the last words of the clause," to be on an equality," is nearer to the Greek and better than the A.V., "to be equal with God." Christ was equal with God (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). He did not cling to the outward manifestation of that equality. The adverbial form <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> implies the state or mode of equality rather than the equality itself. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Being in the form of God (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Being. Not the simple &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to be, but stronger, denoting being which is from the beginning. See on <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15</a>. It has a backward look into an antecedent condition, which has been protracted into the present. Here appropriate to the preincarnate being of Christ, to which the sentence refers. In itself it does not imply eternal, but only prior existence. Form (&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;). We must here dismiss from our minds the idea of shape. The word is used in its philosophic sense, to denote that expression of being which carries in itself the distinctive nature and character of the being to whom it pertains, and is thus permanently identified with that nature and character. Thus it is distinguished from &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; fashion, comprising that which appeals to the senses and which is changeable. &#x39c;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769; form is identified with the essence of a person or thing: &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; fashion is an accident which may change without affecting the form. For the manner in which this difference is developed in the kindred verbs, see on <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>.<p>As applied here to God, the word is intended to describe that mode in which the essential being of God expresses itself. We have no word which can convey this meaning, nor is it possible for us to formulate the reality. Form inevitably carries with it to us the idea of shape. It is conceivable that the essential personality of God may express itself in a mode apprehensible by the perception of pure spiritual intelligences; but the mode itself is neither apprehensible nor conceivable by human minds.<p>This mode of expression, this setting of the divine essence, is not identical with the essence itself, but is identified with it, as its natural and appropriate expression, answering to it in every particular. It is the perfect expression of a perfect essence. It is not something imposed from without, but something which proceeds from the very depth of the perfect being, and into which that being perfectly unfolds, as light from fire. To say, then, that Christ was in the form of God, is to say that He existed as essentially one with God. The expression of deity through human nature (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>) thus has its background in the expression of deity as deity in the eternal ages of God's being. Whatever the mode of this expression, it marked the being of Christ in the eternity before creation. As the form of God was identified with the being of God, so Christ, being in the form of God, was identified with the being, nature, and personality of God.<p>This form, not being identical with the divine essence, but dependent upon it, and necessarily implying it, can be parted with or laid aside. Since Christ is one with God, and therefore pure being, absolute existence, He can exist without the form. This form of God Christ laid aside in His incarnation.<p>Thought it not robbery to be equal with God (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>Robbery is explained in three ways. 1. A robbing, the <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. The thing robbed, a piece of plunder. 3. A prize, a thing to be grasped. Here in the last sense.<p>Paul does not then say, as A.V., that Christ did not think it robbery to be equal with God: for, 1, that fact goes without. saying in the previous expression, being in the form of God. 2. On this explanation the statement is very awkward. Christ, being in the form of God, did not think it robbery to be equal with God; but, after which we should naturally expect, on the other hand, claimed and asserted equality: whereas the statement is: Christ was in the form of God and did not think it robbery to be equal with God, but (instead) emptied Himself. Christ held fast His assertion of divine dignity, but relinquished it. The antithesis is thus entirely destroyed.<p>Taking the word &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; (A.V., robbery) to mean a highly prized possession, we understand Paul to say that Christ, being, before His incarnation, in the form of God, did not regard His divine equality as a prize which was to be grasped at and retained at all hazards, but, on the contrary, laid aside the form of God, and took upon Himself the nature of man. The emphasis in the passage is upon Christ's humiliation. The fact of His equality with God is stated as a background, in order to throw the circumstances of His incarnation into stronger relief. Hence the peculiar form of Paul's statement Christ's great object was to identify Himself with humanity; not to appear to men as divine but as human. Had He come into the world emphasizing His equality with God, the world would have been amazed, but not saved He did not grasp at this. The rather He counted humanity His prize, and so laid aside the conditions of His preexistent state, and became man. </body></html>
