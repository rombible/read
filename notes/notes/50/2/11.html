The context would suggest that meaning here, for the worship paid is obviously the worship done to God. But, though less perfectly, the acknowledgment of universal lordship and majesty (such as He claimed in <a href="/context/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18-20</a>) would satisfy the necessities of the passage. For, after all, to what created being can it be due? (On this confession of Jesus as Lord, see <a href="/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To the glory of God the Father.</span>—The acknowledgment of the glory of Christ is the acknowledgment of the glory of the Father, as the Source of Deity, manifested perfectly in Him.

We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply.

The Syriac reads, "his Father", who has chose and constituted him as the Mediator, invested him with his office, ordained him to be Judge of quick and dead, and given him all power and authority, and exalted him at his own right hand; so he that honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father also.

Consequently (2) the <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε</span> cannot be explained by the idea, according to which the Gnostics made that Aeon, which desired to place itself in unwarranted union with the Absolute, fall from the <span class="ital">Pleroma</span> to the <span class="greekheb">κένωμα</span>—as to which Baur, in this alleged basis for the representation of our passage, lays down merely the distinction, that Paul gives a moral turn to what, with the Gnostics, had a purely speculative signification (“Whilst, therefore, in the Gnostic view, that <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμός</span> indeed actually takes place, but as an unnatural enterprise neutralizes itself, and has, as its result, merely something negative, in this case, in virtue of a moral self-determination, matters cannot come to any such <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμός</span>; and the negative, which even <span class="ital">in this case</span> occurs, not in consequence of an act that has failed, but of one which has not taken place at all, is the voluntary self-renunciation and self-denial by an act of the will, an <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτὸν χενοῦν</span> instead of the <span class="greekheb">γενέσθαι ἐν χενώματι</span>”). (3) That even the notion of the <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ Θεοῦ</span> arose from the language used by the Gnostics, among whom the expressions <span class="greekheb">μορφή</span>, <span class="greekheb">μορφοῦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">μόρφωσις</span>, were very customary, is all the more arbitrarily assumed by Baur, since these expressions were very prevalent <span class="ital">generally</span>, and are not specifically Gnostic designations; indeed, <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ Θεοῦ</span> is not once used by the Gnostics, although it is current among other authors, including philosophers (<span class="ital">e.g</span>. Plat. <span class="ital">Rep</span>. p. 381 C: <span class="greekheb">μένει ἀεὶ ἁπλῶς ἐν τῇ αὑτοῦ μορφῇ</span>, comp. p. 381 B: <span class="greekheb">ἥχιστʼ ἂν πολλὰς μορφὰς ἴσχοι ὁ Θεός</span>). Further, (4) the erroneousness of the view, which in the phrases <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπων</span> and <span class="greekheb">σχήματι εὑρεθεὶς ὡς ἄνθρ</span>. discovers a <span class="ital">Gnostic Docetism</span>, is self-evident from the explanation of these expressions in accordance with the context (see on the passage); and Chrysostom and his successors have rightly brought out the essential difference between what the apostle says in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a> and the Docetic conceptions (Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἦν δὲ τὸ φαινόμενον μόνον</span>, namely, man, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ Θεός</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἦν ψιλὸς ἄνθρωπος</span>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο φήσιν</span>·· <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπων</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ψυχὴ καὶ σῶμα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος δὲ ψυχὴ καὶ σῶμα καὶ Θεός κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

Comp. on <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>. Lastly, (5) even the three categories <span class="greekheb">ἐπουρανίων καὶ ἐπιγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ καταχθ</span>., and also the notion of the <span class="ital">descensus ad inferos</span> which the latter recalls, are alleged by Baur to be genuinely Gnostic. But the idea of the descent to Hades is not distinctively Gnostic; it belongs to the N. T., and is a necessary presupposition lying at the root of many passages (see on <a href="/luke/23-43.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.">Luke 23:43</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a>; <a href="/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a> ff.; <a href="/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a> ff.; <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a> ff.); it is, in fact, the premiss of the entire belief in Christ’s resurrection <span class="greekheb">ἐκ νεκρῶν</span>. That threefold division of all angels and men (see also <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>) was, moreover, so appropriate and natural in the connection of the passage (comp. the twofold division, <span class="greekheb">καὶ νεκρῶν καὶ ζώντων</span>, <a href="/romans/14-9.htm" title="For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.">Romans 14:9</a>, <a href="/acts/10-42.htm" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.">Acts 10:42</a>, <a href="/1_peter/4-5.htm" title="Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.">1 Peter 4:5</a> f., where only <span class="ital">men</span> are in question), that its derivation from Gnosticism could only be justified in the event of the Gnostic character of our passage being demonstrated on other grounds. The whole hypothesis is engrafted on isolated expressions, which only become violently perverted into conceptions of this kind by the <span class="ital">presupposition</span> of a Gnostic atmosphere. According to the Gnostic view, it would perhaps have been said of the Aeon Sophia: <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ ὑπάρχων οὐ προάλλεσθαι ἡγήσατο εἰς τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ Θεοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The <span class="ital">apostle’s</span> expressions agree entirely with the Christology of his other epistles; it is from these and from his own genuine Gnosis laid down in them, that his words are to be understood fully and rightly, and not from the theosophic phantasmagoria of any subsequent Gnosis whatever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[121] Its idea is, that Christ “divests Himself of that which He already is, in order to receive back that of which He has divested Himself, with the full reality of the idea filled with its absolute contents,” Baur, <span class="ital">Neutest. Theol.</span> p. 265.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[122] Hinsch, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 76, does not adopt them, but yet thinks it un-Pauline that the incarnation of Christ is represented <span class="ital">detached from its reference to humanity.</span> This, however, is not the case, as may be gathered from the connection of the passage in its practical bearing with ver. 4 (<span class="greekheb">τὰ ἑτέρων</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Php 2:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κύριος</span>.

It is most significant that <span class="greekheb">Κύριος</span> has no article, which shows that it has become virtually one of Christ’s proper names.

Hort (on <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1 Peter 1:3</a>) compares our verse with <a href="/context/philippians/2-2.htm" title="Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind....">Php 2:2-5</a>. The invocation of one Lord is a bond of unity. The term “Lord” has become one of the most lifeless words in the Christian vocabulary. To enter into its meaning and give it practical effect would be to recreate, in great measure, the atmosphere of the Apostolic Age. [See, on the adoration of Jesus Christ in the Apostolic Age, an interesting essay by T. Zahn in <span class="ital">Skizzen aus d.

I. ch. 1 § 3) ascribed to Jesus the title Saviour, but refused Him that of Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For proof that in apostolic doctrine the supreme Name, Jehovah, was recognized as appropriate to the Person of the Christ, cp. <a href="/john/12-4.htm" title="Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,">John 12:4</a> with <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm" title="Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 6:5</a>.

The duty of unselfish mutual love and self-sacrifice is enforced by considerations on the condescension of Christ which are quite meaningless if He is not preexistent and Divine, and if the reality of His Manhood is not in itself a sublime example of unforced self-abasement for the good of others.
