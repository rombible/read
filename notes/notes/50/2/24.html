The interval between the Letters is unknown. The received belief of St. Paul’s release, and subsequent re-imprisonment (resting on unvarying tradition, and on the evidence of the Pastoral Epistles), supposes this expectation to have been fulfilled in due time.<p><span class= "bld">In the Lord.</span>—So above, <a href="/philippians/2-19.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.">Philippians 2:19</a>. The expression, connected in both cases with matters of practical life and even of detail, is one which (like “the bowels of Jesus Christ” in <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>) belongs to the consciousness of a life so absorbed in Christ, that it cannot think or live in hope except “in the Lord.” But it carries with it, perhaps, also the idea suggested by St. James (<a href="/james/4-15.htm" title="For that you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.">James 4:15</a>) “If the Lord will, we shall do this or that.” Just so far as a hope or prayer is really “in the Lord,” it will be accordant with the Divine will, and will therefore be realised.<p><a href="/context/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25-30</a> contain the immediate mission and commendation of Epaphroditus, who had been sent from Philippi with supplies, had fallen sick, and now in convalescence was longing for home, and fearful lest the report of his sickness should cause them anxiety.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I trust in the Lord ... - note, <a href="/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. also myself&#8212;as well as Timothy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But I trust in the Lord; </span> so he expresseth his strong persuasion, as the word we translate <span class="ital">trust, </span> being seldom used, but when the thing trusted imports the object. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the Lord; </span> i.e. Jesus, whom he doth absolutely and eminently call Lord, being so <span class="ital">highly exalted</span> above all others, <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9</a></span>, not only here, but elsewhere, <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/2-29.htm" title="Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:">Philippians 2:29</a> 3:1 4:1,4,10</span>; on whom he doth wholly depend, aud to whom he doth submit for the issue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That I also myself shall come shortly:</span> before he had suggested his persuasion of abiding with them, <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;">Philippians 1:25</a></span>, and here, that he might satisfy them he had not changed his mind, he adds for their comfort, that they might not be discouraged in their sufferings, what apprehensions he had, after a while, of being set at liberty (if God pleased); and if so, he would have them conceive, soon after he had done what was necessary at Rome, (for him who had care of all the churches), he designed to follow Timothy to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/philippians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I trust in the Lord,....

"I know" (<a href="/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>), "I hope" (<a href="/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>, in the Greek), "I trust" here. The apostle was subject, like all of us, to changing currents of thought, to the ebb and flow of spirits; but his trust was always in the Lord. "Behold," says Chrysostom, "how he makes all things depend upon God." His hope, in all probability, was fulfilled (see <a href="/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>). </body></html>
