It runs, <span class= "ital">As a son to a father</span>—as though St. Paul was going to speak of Timothy’s dutiful ministration and following of his example; but then the sentence changes, in a characteristic humility, and makes Timothy and himself merely fellow-servants—<span class= "ital">he served with me in the gospel.</span> If we may judge of Timothy’s character from the general character of St. Paul’s directions to him in the Pastoral Epistles, and especially the significant exhortation, “Let no man despise thy youth, (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1Timothy 4:12</a>), it would seem to have been gentle and warm-hearted rather than commanding. Hence, perhaps, the necessity for this singularly emphatic commendation of him. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10</a>, “If Timotheus come, see that he be with you without fear.”)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/philippians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/philippians/2-22.htm" title="But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel....">Php 2:22-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">But ye know the proof of him </span>— You know what experience you and I have had of him, who was with me, as well as Silas, in that memorable visit which I first made you, <a href="/context/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:...">Acts 16:1-12</a>.

Here, as Doddridge observes, “we learn the kind of intercourse which should subsist between the younger and more aged ministers of the gospel. The young ought to listen to the counsels of the aged, with the respect which is due from a son to a father; and the aged ought to love and patronise the young, and study, by their instruction and example, to qualify them for supplying their places in the church when they are gone.” <span class="ital">Him therefore I hope to send </span>— If, as has been supposed on <a href="/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Php 2:20</a>, Aristarchus, Titus, and Luke were absent at this time from Rome, Timothy’s presence with the apostle was the more necessary. But as he daily looked for their return, he hoped to be able to send him to Philippi, as soon as he should know how it would go with him with respect to his imprisonment, or what issue his appeal to Cesar would have. <span class="ital">But I trust in the Lord </span>— That in mercy he will deliver me; and <span class="ital">I shall shortly come to</span> <span class="ital">you myself </span>— This he seems to have added, lest the Philippians might have been too much afflicted by what he had said concerning his death, <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued.
