The truth of His humanity is expressed in the phrase “form of a servant;” its unique and ideal character is glanced at when it is said to have worn only the “likeness of men.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/philippians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">But </span>— Or, <span class="ital">nevertheless, </span>as <span class="greekheb">αλλα </span>frequently signifies, and is rendered in our version, particularly <a href="/mark/14-36.htm" title="And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will.">Mark 14:36</a>; <a href="/john/11-15.htm" title="And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go to him.">John 11:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?

This is mentioned, because the critics, who would render the last clause, <span class="ital">he did not covet, </span>or <span class="ital">catch at, a likeness to, </span>or <span class="ital">equality with God, </span>build much of their argument on the opposition of the two clauses, and the force of this particle <span class="greekheb">αλλα</span>; as if the sense were, <span class="ital">He did not affect this equality, </span>but humbled himself; an interpretation which, as Bishop Burnet well observes, “is extremely cold and insipid, as if it were a mighty argument of humility, that though Christ wrought miracles, which they strangely think to be signified by the phrase of being in <span class="ital">the form of God, </span>yet he did not set up for Supreme Deity!” But the truth is, the power of working miracles is never, in Scripture, styled <span class="ital">the form of God; </span>and, indeed, were this all that was intended by that phrase, both Moses and Elias, and our Lord’s apostles, might, upon that account, be said to have been in the form of God; seeing both Moses and Elias wrought many miracles on earth; and Christ declared concerning his disciples, that they should work greater miracles than he had wrought. <span class="ital">Made himself of no reputation </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εαυτον εκενωσε</span>, literally, <span class="ital">he emptied himself; </span>divested himself both of the form of God, and of the worship due to him as God, when he was made in the likeness of men. In other words, he was so far from tenaciously insisting upon, that he willingly relinquished, his claim: he was content to forego the glories of the Creator, and to appear in the form of a creature: nay, to be made in the likeness of the fallen creatures; and not only to share in the disgrace, but to suffer the punishment due to the meanest and vilest of them all. He emptied himself: for though in a sense he remained full, (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>,) yet he appeared as if he had been empty; for he veiled his fulness, at least from the sight of men; yea, he not only veiled, but in some sense renounced the glory which he had before the world was: taking, and by that very act emptying himself, <span class="ital">the form of a servant </span>— To his Father and to his Father’s creatures; yea, to men, even to poor and mean men, being among his disciples as one that served. <span class="ital">And was made </span>— Or <span class="ital">born, </span>as <span class="greekheb">γενομενος </span>may be properly rendered; <span class="ital">in the likeness of men </span>— Subject to all our wants and infirmities, and resembling us in all things but sin. And hereby he took the form of a servant; and his doing this would have been astonishing humiliation, even if he had appeared possessed of the wealth, power, and glory of the greatest monarch; but it was much more so, as he assumed human nature in a state of poverty, reproach, and suffering. This expression, it must be observed, <span class="ital">born in the likeness of men, </span>does not imply that Christ had only the appearance of a man: for the word <span class="greekheb">ομοιωμα</span>, rendered <span class="ital">likeness, </span>often denotes sameness of nature. Thus Adam is said, (<a href="/genesis/5-3.htm" title="And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:">Genesis 5:3</a>,) to beget a son in <span class="ital">his own likeness, after his image; </span>and Christ, <span class="greekheb">ομοιωθηναι</span>, <span class="ital">to be made like his brethren in all things, </span>by partaking of flesh and blood, <a href="/context/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;...">Hebrews 2:14-17</a>.

The antithesis in this passage is elegant.

We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But made himself of no reputation - This translation by no means conveys the sense of the original According to this it would seem that he consented to be without distinction or honor among people; or that he was willing to be despised or disregarded. The Greek is &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  heauton ekeno&#772;sen. The word &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;  kenoo&#772; means literally, to empty, "to make empty, to make vain or void." It is rendered: "made void" in <a href="/romans/4-14.htm">Romans 4:14</a>; "made of none effect," <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>; "make void," <a href="/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; "should be vain," <a href="/2_corinthians/9-3.htm">2 Corinthians 9:3</a>. The word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, except in the passage before us. The essential idea is that of bringing to emptiness, vanity, or nothingness; and, hence, it is applied to a case where one lays aside his rank and dignity, and becomes in respect to that as nothing; that is, he assumes a more humble rank and station. In regard to its meaning here, we may remark:<p>(1) that it cannot mean that he literally divested himself of his divine nature and perfections, for that was impossible. He could not cease to be omnipotent, and omnipresent, and most holy, and true, and good.<p>(2) it is conceivable that he might have laid aside, for a time, the symbols or the manifestation of his glory, or that the outward expressions of his majesty in heaven might have been withdrawn. It is conceivable for a divine being to intermit the exercise of his almighty power, since it cannot be supposed that God is always exerting his power to the utmost. And in like manner there might be for a time a laying aside or intermitting of these manifestations or symbols, which were expressive of the divine glory and perfections. Yet,<p>(3) this supposes no change in the divine nature, or in the essential glory of the divine perfections. When the sun is obscured by a cloud, or in an eclipse, there is no real change of its glory, nor are his beams extinguished, nor is the sun himself in any measure changed. His luster is only for a time obscured. So it might have been in regard to the manifestation of the glory of the Son of God. Of course there is much in regard to this which is obscure, but the language of the apostle undoubtedly implies more than that he took an humble place, or that he demeaned himself in an humble manner. In regard to the actual change respecting his manifestations in heaven, or the withdrawing of the symbols of his glory there, the Scriptures are nearly silent, and conjecture is useless - perhaps improper. The language before us fairly implies that he laid aside that which was expressive of his being divine - that glory which is involved in the phrase "being in the form of God" - and took upon himself another form and manifestation in the condition of a servant.<p>And took upon him the form of a servant - The phrase "form of a servant," should be allowed to explain the phrase "form of God," in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>. The "form of a servant" is that which indicates the condition of a servant, in contradistinction from one of higher rank. It means to appear as a servant, to perform the offices of a servant, and to be regarded as such. He was made like a servant in the lowly condition which he assumed. The whole connection and force of the argument here demands this interpretation. Storr and Rosenmuller interpret this as meaning that he became the servant or minister of God, and that in doing it, it was necessary that he should become a man. But the objection to this is obvious. It greatly weakens the force of the apostle's argument. His object is to state the depth of humiliation to which he descended, and this was best done by saying that he descended to the lowest condition of humanity and appeared in the most humble garb. The idea of being a "servant or minister of God" would not express that, for this is a term which might be applied to the highest angel in heaven. Though the Lord Jesus was not literally a servant or slave, yet what is here affirmed was true of him in the following respects:<p>(1) He occupied a most lowly condition in life.<p>(2) he condescended to perform such acts as are appropriate only to those who are servants. "I am among you as he that serveth;" <a href="/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4-15</a>.<p>And was made in the likeness of men - Margin, habit. The Greek word means likeness, resemblance. The meaning is, he was made like unto people by assuming such a body as theirs; see the notes at <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. made himself of no reputation, and &#8230; and&#8212;rather as the Greek, "emptied Himself, taking upon him the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men." The two latter clauses (there being no conjunctions, "and &#8230; and," in the Greek) expresses in what Christ's "emptying of Himself" consists, namely, in "taking the form of a servant" (see on [2384]Heb 10:5; compare Ex 21:5, 6, and Ps 40:6, proving that it was at the time when He assumed a body, He took "the form of a servant"), and in order to explain how He took "the form of a servant," there is added, by "being made in the likeness of men." His subjection to the law (Lu 2:21; Ga 4:4) and to His parents (Lu 2:51), His low state as a carpenter, and carpenter's reputed son (Mt 13:55; Mr 6:3), His betrayal for the price of a bond-servant (Ex 21:32), and slave-like death to relieve us from the slavery of sin and death, finally and chiefly, His servant-like dependence as man on God, while His divinity was not outwardly manifested (Isa 49:3, 7), are all marks of His "form as a servant." This proves: (1) He was in the form of a servant as soon as He was made man. (2) He was "in the form of God" before He was "in the form of a servant." (3) He did as really subsist in the divine nature, as in the form of a servant, or in the nature of man. For He was as much "in the form of God" as "in the form of a servant"; and was so in the form of God as "to be on an equality with God"; He therefore could have been none other than God; for God saith, "To whom will ye liken Me and make Me equal?" (Isa 46:5), [Bishop Pearson]. His emptying Himself presupposes His previous plenitude of Godhead (Joh 1:14; Col 1:19; 2:9). He remained full of this; yet He bore Himself as if He were empty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But; </span> some expound this particle as a discretive, others an adversative, or redditive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Made himself of no reputation; </span> i.e. most wittingly emptied himself, or abated himself, of the all fulness of glory he had equally with God the Father, that, considering the disproportion between the creature and the Creator, he, in the eyes of those amongst whom he tabernacled, appeared to have nothing of reputation left him, <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/9-26.htm" title="And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.">Daniel 9:26</a></span>.

It is the nature of lord and servant, to relate to each other. Every servant is a man (brutes are not servants). Labouring in service accompanies the human nature, which is common to Christ with other men, on whom it crept by the fall: Christ regards none others’ will but the will of his Father, how hard soever it was, even to the laying down of his life for the reconciling of his church to him. And be sure he died as a man, and not only in the habit of a servant. Only in human nature could he (as it follows without a particle in the Greek) be made like unto men, or in the likeness and habit of men. The Hellenists do use words of similitude, when they design sameness, or the thing itself, and that indeed essentially.

But what is now the natural affection of all men from the fall of Adam, and is an infirmity and abatement, as to that, he was without sin, and only in the likeness of sinful flesh. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/philippians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But made himself of no reputation,.... Or "nevertheless emptied himself"; not of that fulness of grace which was laid up in him from everlasting, for with this he appeared when he was made flesh, and dwelt among men; nor of the perfections of his divine nature, which were not in the least diminished by his assumption of human nature, for all the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily; though he took that which he had not before, he lost nothing of what he had; the glory of his divine nature was covered, and out of sight; and though some rays and beams of it broke out through his works and miracles, yet his glory, as the only begotten of the Father, was beheld only by a few; the minds of the far greater part were blinded, and their hearts hardened, and they saw no form nor comeliness in him to desire him; the form of God in which he was, was hid from them; they reputed him as a mere man, yea, as a sinful man, even as a worm, and no man: and to be thus esteemed, and had in such account, he voluntarily subjected himself, though infinitely great and glorious; as he did not assume deity by rapine, he was not thrust down into this low estate by force; as the angels that sinned when they affected to be as God, were drove from their seats of glory, and cast down into hell; and when man, through the instigation of Satan, was desirous of the same, he was turned out of Eden, and became like the beasts that perish; but this was Christ's own act and deed, he willingly assented to it, to lay aside as it were his glory for a while, to have it veiled and hid, and be reckoned anything, a mere man, yea, to have a devil, and not be God: O wondrous humility! astonishing condescension! <p>and took upon him the form of a servant; this also was voluntary; he "took upon him", was not obliged, or forced to be in the form of a servant; he appeared as one in human nature, and was really such; a servant to his Father, who chose, called, sent, upheld, and regarded him as a servant; and a very prudent, diligent, and faithful one he was unto him: and he was also a servant to his people, and ministered to men; partly by preaching the Gospel to them, and partly by working miracles, healing their diseases, and going about to do good, both to the bodies and souls of men; and chiefly by obtaining eternal redemption for his chosen ones, by being made sin and a curse for them; which though a very toilsome and laborious piece of service, yet as he cheerfully engaged in it, he diligently attended it, until he had finished it: so he was often prophesied of as a servant, in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, in which several places he is called in the Targum, , "my servant the Messiah": put these two together, "the form of God", and "the form of a servant", and admire the amazing stoop! <p>and was made in the likeness of men; not of the first Adam, for though, as he, he was without sin, knew none, nor did any; yet he was rather like to sinful men, and was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and was traduced and treated as a sinner, and numbered among transgressors; he was like to men, the most mean and abject, such as were poor, and in lower life, and were of the least esteem and account among men, on any score: or he was like to men in common, and particularly to his brethren the seed of Abraham, and children of God that were given him; he partook of the same flesh and blood, he had a true body, and a reasonable soul, as they; he was subject to the like sorrows and griefs, temptations, reproaches, and persecutions; and was like them in everything, excepting sin: a strange and surprising difference this, that he who was "equal to God", should be "like to sinful men!" <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But made himself of <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> no reputation, and took upon him the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</span><p>(g) He brought himself from all things, as it were to nothing.<p>(h) By taking our manhood upon him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀλλʼ ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε</span>] The emphatically prefixed <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτόν</span> is correlative to the likewise emphatic <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγμόν</span> in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a>.

This drove also the ancient dogmatic expositors to adopt the gloss, which is here out of place, that Christ assumed the <span class="ital">accidentales infirmitates corporis</span> (yet without sin), not <span class="ital">ex naturae necessitate</span>, but <span class="ital">ex</span> <span class="greekheb">οἰκονομίας</span> <span class="ital">libertate</span> (Calovius).[113] By others, the characteristic of <span class="ital">debile et abjectum</span> (Hoelemann, following older expositors) is obtruded upon the word <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπων</span>, which is here to be taken in a purely <span class="ital">generic</span> sense; while Grotius understood <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>. as referring to the <span class="ital">first</span> human beings, and believed that the <span class="ital">sinlessness</span> of Jesus was meant.

The explanation of the expression by the unique position of Christ as the <span class="ital">second Adam</span> (Weiss) is alien from the context, which presents to us the relation, not of the second man to the first man, but of the <span class="ital">God-man</span> to <span class="ital">ordinary</span> humanity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ σχήμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὑρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἄνθρωπ</span>.] to be closely connected with the preceding participial affirmation, the thought of which is <span class="ital">emphatically exhausted: “and in fashion was found as a man,</span>” so that the divine nature (the Logos-nature) was not perceived in Him. <span class="greekheb">σχῆμα</span>, <span class="ital">habitus</span>, which receives its more precise reference from the context (Pflugk, <span class="ital">ad Eur.

The division does not seem natural or necessary.—<span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δούλου λ</span>. The clause defines <span class="greekheb">ἐκένωσε</span>. Christ’s assumption of the “form” of a <span class="greekheb">δοῦλος</span> does not imply that the innermost basis of His personality, His “ego,” was changed, although, indeed, “there was more in this emptying of Himself than we can think or say” (Rainy, <span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, p. 119). [1]δ. simply describes the humility to which He condescended. It is needless to ask whose <span class="greekheb">δοῦλος</span> He became. The question is not before the Apostle.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὁμοιώ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">γεν</span>. as opposed to <span class="greekheb">ὑπάρχων</span>, “becoming” as opposed to “being by nature”.

Christ walked this earth in the <span class="ital">real</span> likeness of men. This was no mere phantom, no mere incomplete copy of humanity. And yet Paul feels that it did not express the whole of Christ’s nature. It was not “an hereditary likeness of being” (Hltzm[2] See <span class="ital">N.T. Th.</span>, ii., pp. 70–72). It was, in a sense, borrowed.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>. Almost = “mankind,” “humanity”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] Codex Sangallensis<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2]ltzm.

See Bp Ellicott’s careful note here, in which this explanation is advocated against that which would paraphrase, “<span class="ital">Although</span> He <span class="ital">thought it no usurpation</span> to be equal with God, <span class="ital">yet</span> He made, &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Himself</span>” is slightly emphatic by position, laying a stress on the sacred free will of the Lord in His Humiliation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Made himself of no reputation:</span>”—lit., as R.V., <span class="bld">emptied Himself</span>. The (Romanist) Rhemish Version, 1582, verbally following the Vulgate (<span class="ital">semetipsum exinanivit</span>), has, “<span class="ital">exinanited Himself</span>.” From the Greek the word <span class="ital">kenôsis</span> (κένωσις) has passed into theological language, appearing here and there in the Fathers, frequently in modern treatises. Of recent years much has been said upon this great mystery in the direction of proving or suggesting that during “the days of His Flesh” (<a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>) the Lord (<span class="ital">practically</span>) parted with His Deity; becoming the (Incarnate) Son of God only in His glorification after death. Such a view seems to contravene many plain testimonies of the Gospels, and most of all the pervading <span class="ital">tone</span> of the Gospels, as they present to us in the Lord Jesus on earth a Figure “meek and lowly” indeed, but always infinitely and mysteriously majestic; significantly dependent indeed on the Father, and on the Spirit, but always speaking to man in the manner of One able to deal sovereignly with all man’s needs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is enough for us to know that His Humiliation, or to use the word here, Exinanition, <span class="ital">Kenôsis</span>, was profoundly real; that He was pleased, as to His holy Manhood, to live in dependence on the Spirit; while yet we are sure that the inalienable basis of His Personality was always, eternally, presently, Divine. The ultimate and reasoned <span class="ital">analysis</span> of the unique Phenomenon, God and Man, One Christ, is, <span class="ital">as to its actual consciousness</span>, if we may use the word, a matter more for His knowledge than our enquiry. Bp Lightfoot’s brief note here says nearly all that can be said with reverent certainty: “ ‘He divested Himself’ not of His Divine nature, for this was impossible, but of the glories, the prerogatives, of Deity. This He did by taking upon Him the form of a servant.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and took</span> upon him] Lit. and better, with R.V., <span class="bld">taking</span>. The thought is that the Exinanition <span class="ital">was</span> the “taking”; not a process previous to it. In the word “<span class="ital">taking</span>” the Lord’s free choice and action is again in view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the form of a servant</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">of a bondservant, a slave</span>. The word rendered “<span class="ital">form</span>” is the same as that in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a>, on which see note. Here, as there, the thing implied is not <span class="ital">semblance</span> but <span class="ital">manifestation</span>. He became in reality, and in consequent appearance, a bondservant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With what special reference is the word “bondservant” here used? Does it point to His stooping to serve <span class="ital">men</span> in great humiliation? Or to His undertaking, in the act of becoming Man, that essential condition of man’s true life—bondservice to <span class="ital">God</span>? The order of words and thought is in favour of the latter. The Apostle goes on to say, in effect, that His taking the slave’s “form” was coincident with His coming “in the likeness of <span class="ital">men</span>” generally, not of specially humiliated or oppressed men. <span class="ital">As Man</span> He was “bondservant”. And this points to a bondservice related directly to God, as Lord of man. In this as in other things He was the archetype of all His true followers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>True, our blessed Lord made Himself the servant of all, and on one occasion (John 13) took literally the place and work of a menial attendant; a fact to which much allusion is made by St Chrysostom here. But all the while He was far more Lord than servant, certainly than bondservant, in His relations with men, even in His most tender and gracious relations. Literal “slavery” to man He certainly did not enter upon; royally descended as He was, and toiling as a free artificer, and commanding and teaching always with authority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and was made</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">coming to be, becoming</span>. The fact is stated as <span class="ital">coincident</span> with the last statement. See previous note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the likeness of men</span>] A double suggestion lies in the words; (<span class="ital">a</span>) that He was really <span class="ital">like</span> man, as He truly <span class="ital">was</span> man; accepting the conditions involved in a truly human exterior, with its liabilities to trial and suffering; and (<span class="ital">b</span>) that He was also <span class="ital">more than man, other than man</span>, without which fact there would be not resemblance but <span class="ital">mere identity</span>. Cp. a somewhat similar case, <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>, where lit. “in the <span class="ital">likeness</span> of the flesh of sin.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Of men</span>,” not “<span class="ital">of man:</span>”—as if to make the statement as concrete as possible.

This he did once for all, as the aorist implies, at the Incarnation. The word "emptied' involves a previous fullness, "a precedent plenitude" (Pearson on the Creed, 2:25).

And took upon him the form of a servant; rather, as R.V., taking the form. The two clauses refer to the same act of self-humiliation regarded from its two sides. He emptied himself of his glory, taking at the same time the form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> as in Ver. 6, the essential attributes) of a servant, literally, of a slave. Observe, he was originally (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in the form of God; he took (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) the form of a slave. The Godhead was his by right, the manhood by his own voluntary act: both are equally real; he is perfect God and perfect Man. Isaiah prophesied of Christ (<a href="/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49</a> and Isaiah 52; comp. <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>, in the Greek or R.V.) as the Servant of Jehovah; he came to do the Father's will, submitting his own will in all things: "Not as I will, but as thou wilt" (comp. <a href="/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27, 28</a>; <a href="/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44, 45</a><span class="cmt_word">).

Form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>) asserts the reality of our Lord's human nature. Likeness (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) refers only to external appearance: this word, of course, does not imply that our Lord was not truly man, but, as Chrysostom says ('Hom.,' 8:247), he was more. than man; "We are soul and body, but he is God and soul and body." <span class="accented">The likeness of men</span>; because Christ is the Representative of humanity: he took upon him, not a human person, but human nature. He is one person in two natures.

The general sense is that He divested Himself of that peculiar mode of existence which was proper and peculiar to Him as one with God. He laid aside the form of God. In so doing, He did not divest Himself of His divine nature. The change was a change of state: the form of a servant for the form of God. His personality continued the same. His self-emptying was not self-extinction, nor was the divine Being changed into a mere man. In His humanity He retained the consciousness of deity, and in His incarnate state carried out the mind which animated Him before His incarnation. He was not unable to assert equality with God. He was able not to assert it.<p>Form of a servant (&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>The same word for form as in the phrase form of God, and with the same sense. The mode of expression of a slave's being is indeed apprehensible, and is associated with human shape, but it is not this side of the fact which Paul is developing. It is that Christ assumed that mode of being which answered to, and was the complete and characteristic expression of, the slave's being. The mode itself is not defined. This is appropriately inserted here as bringing out the contrast with counted not equality with God, etc. What Christ grasped at in His incarnation was not divine sovereignty, but service.<p>Was made in the likeness of men (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., becoming in, etc. Notice the choice of the verb, not was, but became: entered into a new state. Likeness. The word does not imply the reality of our Lord's humanity, &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769; form implied the reality of His deity. That fact is stated in the form of a servant. Neither is &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; image employed, which, for our purposes, implies substantially the same as &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;. See on <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>. As form of a servant exhibits the inmost reality of Christ's condition as a servant - that He became really and essentially the servant of men (<a href="/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>) - so likeness of men expresses the fact that His mode of manifestation resembled what men are. This leaves room for the assumption of another side of His nature - the divine - in the likeness of which He did not appear. As He appealed to men, He was like themselves, with a real likeness; but this likeness to men did not express His whole self. The totality of His being could not appear to men, for that involved the form of God. Hence the apostle views Him solely as He could appear to men. All that was possible was a real and complete likeness to humanity. What He was essentially and eternally could not enter into His human mode of existence. Humanly He was like men, but regarded with reference to His whole self, He was not identical with man, because there was an element of His personality which did not dwell in them - equality with God. Hence the statement of His human manifestation is necessarily limited by this fact, and is confined to likeness and does not extend to identity. "To affirm likeness is at once to assert similarity and to deny sameness" (Dickson). See on <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>. </body></html>
