Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued.

This verse and <a href="/philippians/2-28.htm">Philippians 2:28</a> contain the reasons of the apostle's sending him; and the first is, because he had a very vehement and longing desire after all of them; to see them, as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions add, and as it is read in the Alexandrian and Claromontane copies, and in others: it was not the city of Philippi he longed to see, which might be his native place, nor his natural relations and family, but the church there; and not the officers of it only, the bishops and deacons, but all the members of it, rich and poor, high and low, strong and weak believers: <p>and was full of heaviness: almost pressed down, quite disheartened and dispirited, ready to sink and die away, not so much with his own disorder and illness, as with sorrow on account of the church at Philippi: <p>because that ye had heard that he had been sick: he understood that the news of his sickness had reached them, and he knew how distressing it would be to them, that it would cut them to the heart, and press them heavily, fearing they should never see his face, nor hear his voice more.

Only three times elsewhere in Paul. The difference between it and <span class="greekheb">ἐπεί</span> is tersely stated by Ell[7]. (<span class="ital">ad loc.</span>), who notes that it “involves the quasi-temporal reference which is supplied by <span class="greekheb">δή</span>, and thus expresses a thing that at once ensues (temporarily or causally) on the occurrence or realisation of another”.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>. A common N.T. construction. Perhaps the use of the imperfect may be due to Aramaic influence (see Schmid, <span class="ital">Atticismus</span>, iii., p. 113 ff.). In classical Greek it is fairly frequent with the perfect and pluperfect. See Kühner, <span class="ital">Ausführl.

The Apostle wishes to disarm all prejudices against Epaphr.—<span class="greekheb">ἀδημονῶν</span>. “In sore anguish.” In its two other occurrences in N.T. it describes the agony in Gethsemane. While not found in LXX (but several exx. in Symmachus) it occurs a few times in later Greek. The derivations usually given are doubtful.—<span class="greekheb">ἠκούσατε</span>. Probably we must suppose that the Philippians, on hearing that Epaphrod. was ill, had written a letter to which <span class="ital">this</span> is the answer.—<span class="greekheb">ἠσθένησε</span>. We might translate, “had fallen sick,” an ingressive aorist. But with the same tense in <a href="/philippians/2-27.htm" title="For indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow on sorrow.">Php 2:27</a>, perhaps it is better to look upon the aorist as summing up the whole experience of Epaphrod. as a single fact, and viewing it in this light. This is a common Greek usage (see Burton, <span class="ital">MT</span>[8]., p. 20).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[7] Ellicott.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[8] <span class="ital">.</span> <span class="ital">Moods and Tenses</span> (Burton, Goodwin).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/philippians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>] Here lay the “necessity,” in St Paul’s view, of his friend’s return to the Philippians; in Epaphroditus’ longing for them, and their love and anxiety in regard of him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he longed</span>] The Greek is full and emphatic, <span class="bld">he was (in a state of) longing</span>, of home-sickness. See note on <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>.—Doubtless the feeling was a recent if not a present one; and in an English letter we should say accordingly, “<span class="ital">he has been</span> in a home-sick condition.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after you all</span>] A reading which has considerable support is “<span class="ital">to see you all</span>.” The precise phrase thus formed occurs <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2 Timothy 1:4</a>. Perhaps this is a reason for deciding against it here, as it might be a transcriber’s reminiscence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the still recurring “<span class="ital">you all</span>.” Epaphroditus may have been in some way involved in those differences between sets and circles at Philippi (see above, on <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a>, &c.) which gave St Paul anxiety.
