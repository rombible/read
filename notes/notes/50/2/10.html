We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow - The knee should bow, or bend, in token of honor, or worship; that is, all people should adore him. This cannot mean merely that at the mention of the name of Jesses we should bow; nor is there any evidence that God requires this. Why should we bow at the mention of that name, rather than at any of the other titles of the Redeemer? Is there any special sacredness or honor in it above the other names which he bears? And why should we how at his name rather than at the name of the Father! Besides, if any special homage is to be paid to the name of the Saviour under the authority of this passage - and this is the only one on which the authority of this custom is based - it should be by bowing the knee, not the head. But the truth is, this authorizes and requires neither; and the custom of bowing at the name of Jesus, in some churches, has arisen entirely from a misinterpretation of this passage. There is no other place in the Bible to which an appeal is made to authorize the custom; compare Neal's History of the Puritans, chapter 5. Ninth 5. The meaning here is, not that a special act of respect or adoration should be shown wherever the name "Jesus" occurs in reading the Scriptures, or whenever it is mentioned, but that he was so exalted that it would be proper that all in heaven and on earth should worship him, and that the time would come when he would be thus everywhere acknowledged as Lord. The bowing of the knee properly expresses homage, respect, adoration (compare the notes at <a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>); and it cannot be done to the Saviour by those who are in heaven, unless it be divine.<p>Of things in heaven - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  epouranio&#772;n - rather of beings in heaven, the word "things" being improperly supplied by our translators. The word may be in the neuter plural; but it may be also in the masculine plural, and denote beings rather than things. Things do not bow the knee; and the reference here is undoubtedly to angels, and to the "spirits of the just made perfect" in heaven. If Jesus is worshipped there, he is divine; for there is no idolatry eta creature in heaven. In this whole passage there is probably an allusion to <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; see it illustrated in the notes at <a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>. In the great divisions here specified - of those in heaven, on the earth, and under the earth - the apostle intends, doubtless, to denote the universe. The same mode of designating the universe occurs in <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11-12</a>. This mode of expression is equivalent to saying, "all that is above, around, and beneath us," and arises from what appears to us. The division is natural and obvious - that which is above us in the heavens, that which is on the earth where we dwell, and all that is beneath us.<p>And things in earth - Rather, "beings on earth," to wit, people; for they only are capable of rendering homage.<p>And things under the earth - Beings under the earth. The whole universe shall confess that he is Lord. This embraces, doubtless, those who have departed from this life, and perhaps includes also fallen angels. The meaning is, that riley shall all acknowledge him as universal Lord; all how to his sovereign will; all be subject to his control; all recognize him as divine. The fallen and the lost will do this; for they will be constrained to yield an unwilling homage to him by submitting to the sentence from his lips that shall consign them to woe; and thus the whole universe shall acknowledge the exalted dignity of the Son of God. But this does not mean that they will all be saved, for the guilty and the lost may be compelled to acknowledge his power, and submit to his decree as the sovereign of the universe. There is the free and cheerful homage of the heart which they who worship him in heaven will render; and there is the constrained homage which they must yield who are compelled to acknowledge his authority. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. at the name&#8212;rather as Greek, "in the name."<p>bow&#8212;rather, "bend," in token of worship. Referring to Isa 45:23; quoted also in Ro 14:11. To worship "in the name of Jesus," is to worship Jesus Himself (compare Php 2:11; Pr 18:10), or God in Christ (Joh 16:23; Eph 3:14). Compare "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord (that is, whosoever shall call on the Lord in His revealed character) shall be saved" (Ro 10:13; 1Co 1:2); "all that call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord" (compare 2Ti 2:22); "call on the Lord"; Ac 7:59, "calling upon &#8230; and saying, Lord Jesus" (Ac 9:14, 21; 22:16).<p>of things in heaven&#8212;angels.

Which is to be understood, not of the outward act of bowing the knee upon hearing the name, and the syllables of the mere name Jesus pronounced; for in the bare name there can be nothing which can command such a peculiar respect; it was a name common with the Jews: Joshua is so called in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>; and the name of Elymas the sorcerer was Barjesus: that is, the son of Jesus, <a href="/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; Now, how monstrously ridiculous and stupid would it be, for a man, upon hearing these passages, and upon the pronouncing of this word, to bow the knee? Moreover, the words ought not to be rendered at, but "in the name of Jesus"; that is, in and by reason of the power, authority, and dignity of Jesus, as exalted at God's right hand, every creature is to be subject to him: add to this, that there are several creatures included in the following account, who, in a corporeal sense, have not knees to bow with, as angels, the souls of men departed, and devils; and therefore an external corporeal bowing of the knee cannot be meant. The Jews indeed, upon hearing the name Jehovah pronounced by the high priest, in the holy of holies, used to bow: they say (n), <p>"that the priests, and the people, that stand in the court, when they hear Shemhamphorash (i.e. the name "Jehovah") pronounced by the high priest, , "bowed", and worshipped, and fell upon their faces, and said, blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom, for ever and ever: <p>though it can hardly be thought there is any reference to this here. But inasmuch as this action is a token of reverence, worship; and subjection, it is used for those things themselves; and the sense is, that Christ is exalted as before described, that every creature may give him reverence, worship, and adoration, submit and be subject to him, as all do, and shall, either freely or forcedly.

Comp. also Hofmann: “the praying <span class="ital">to God, determined</span> in the person praying <span class="ital">by the consciousness of his relation to Jesus as regulating his action.</span>” Instead of this we should rather say: the praying <span class="ital">to Jesus</span>, determined by the consciousness of the relation <span class="ital">of Jesus to God</span> (of the Son to the Father), as regulating the action of the person praying. All modes of explaining away the adoration as offered <span class="ital">to Jesus Himself</span> are at variance not only with the context generally, which has to do with the honour of <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, making Him the <span class="ital">object</span> of the adoration, but also with the word <span class="greekheb">ἐπουρανίων</span> which follows, because the <span class="ital">mediatorship</span> of Jesus, which is implied in the <span class="ital">atonement</span>, does not affect the <span class="ital">angels</span> as its objects (comp., on the contrary, <a href="/hebrews/1-4.htm" title="Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.">Hebrews 1:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>). The two sentences may not be separated from one another (in opposition to Hofmann); but, on the contrary, it must be maintained that the personal object, to whom the bowing of the knee as well as the confession with the tongue applies, is <span class="ital">Jesus</span>. Linguistically erroneous is the view which makes <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ὀνόμ</span>. equivalent to <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ὄνομα</span>, <span class="ital">for the glorification of His dignity</span> (Heinrichs, Flatt, and others), or as <span class="ital">a paraphrase for</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν Ἰησοῦ</span> (Estius; Rheinwald leaves either of the two to be chosen); while others, by the interpretation. “<span class="ital">quoties auditur nomen</span>,[119] brought out a sense which is altogether without analogy in the N.

But the previous argument (see last note but one), if valid, is decisive for the rendering of the R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">In the name … should bow</span>, &c.” Does this mean, “all should worship Him,” or “all should worship <span class="ital">through Him</span>”? Doubtless the latter is Divine truth. But the context is wholly in favour of an immediate reference to <span class="ital">His</span> enthronement; and particularly the very next verse speaks distinctly of the recognition of Him as “Lord.” So Lightfoot; and he gives proofs from the LXX.

We may thus paraphrase, “that before the revealed Majesty of the glorified Jesus all creation should adore.”—The ancient custom of bowing at the mention of the Name Jesus (see Canon xviii. of the Church of England) derives no <span class="ital">direct</span> sanction from this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every knee should bow</span>] An implicit citation of <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm" title="I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.">Isaiah 45:23</a>; and as such a powerful testimony to St Paul’s view of the proper Deity of Jesus Christ.—The context of the passage in the prophet contains the phrases “a just God and a Saviour” (<a href="/philippians/2-21.htm" title="For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.">Php 2:21</a>; cp. <a href="/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a>); “in the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory” (<a href="/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Php 2:25</a>; cp. <a href="/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>).

In view of the language there, in a scene where angels have been already mentioned, it is better not to divide the reference here, e.g. between angels, living men, and buried men (Alford), or angels, men, and lost spirits (Chrysostom).

Comp. also (in the Greek) Psalm 43:9; 104:3; <a href="/1_kings/8-44.htm">1 Kings 8:44</a>; also the common Septuagint phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). Observe, the words are, not "the name Jesus," but "the name of Jesus;" the name, that is, which God freely gave to him (Ver. 9), It is the name which is above every name, that is, the majesty, the glory of Jesus, which is to be the object of Christian worship. The end of the whole passage being the exaltation of Jesus, it seems more natural to understand this verse of worship paid to Jesus than of worship offered through him to God the Father. Observe also that the words (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>) on which this passage is formed are the words of Jehovah: "Unto <span class="accented">me</span> every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear." They could not be used without impiety of any but God<span class="cmt_word">. Of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth</span>. Perhaps the angels, the living, and the dead; or, more probably (comp. <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21, 22</a>), all creation, animate and inanimate, is represented as uniting in the universal adoration. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>At the name of Jesus (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., better, in the name. The name means here the personal name; but as including all that is involved in the name. See on <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>. Hence the salutation is not at the name of Jesus, as by bowing when the name is uttered, but, as Ellicott rightly says: "the spiritual sphere, the holy element as it were, in which every prayer is to be offered and every knee to bow." Compare <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>.<p>Things in heaven, etc.<p>Compare <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>. The words may apply either to all intelligent beings or to all things. The latter is in accord with Paul's treatment of the creation collectively in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-22</a>, and with the Old-Testament passages, in which all nature is represented as praising God, as <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1-14</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-13.htm">Psalm 65:13</a>. </body></html>
