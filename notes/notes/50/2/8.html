and in it they found “no form or comeliness,” or “beauty, that they should desire Him” (<a href="/context/isaiah/53-2.htm" title="For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>). From this St. Paul proceeds to the last act of His self-humiliation in death: “He became obedient,” that is, to God’s will, “even up to death.” His death is not here regarded as an atonement, for in that light it could be no pattern to us; but as the completion of the obedience of His life. (See <a href="/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a>.) Of that life as a whole He said, “I came down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me” (<a href="/john/6-38.htm" title="For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.">John 6:38</a>); and the doing that will (see <a href="/context/hebrews/10-9.htm" title="Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.">Hebrews 10:9-10</a>) ended in “the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.” In this light His death is the perfection of the suffering which, in consequence of the power of sin in the world, must be faced in doing the will of God (see <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.">2Timothy 3:12</a>); in this light we can follow it, and even “fill up what is lacking of the sufferings of Christ” (<a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even the death of the cross.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">and that too, the death of the cross; </span>emphasising its peculiar shame and humiliation as an “accursed” death. (See <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/philippians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Php 2:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And being found in fashion as a man — </span>A common man, without any peculiar excellence or comeliness. The word <span class="greekheb">σχημα</span>, rendered <span class="ital">fashion, </span>includes all the particulars of a person’s outward appearance; such as his figure, air, looks, clothing, and gait. The word is also applied to things inanimate, as, (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-31.htm" title="And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>,) <span class="ital">the fashion of this world passeth away.

The Son of God did not proudly continue in his high station, but descended from it for a while, and placed himself in the lowest condition among men, serving every one with the humility and assiduity of a servant, or bondman, as <span class="greekheb">δουλος </span>signifies. Then, in obedience to his Father, (<a href="/john/6-38.htm" title="For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.">John 6:38</a>,) he finished his services by suffering the painful and ignominious death of the cross as a malefactor, for the salvation of the world. Having this great example of humility and benevolence set before them by their Master, his disciples, who are above their brethren in station, should not on every occasion behave as their superiors; but, laying aside their dignity, they should cheerfully perform in person to their inferiors those offices of kindness and humanity which their distress requires; especially when the assistance wanted by their inferiors is of such an urgent nature that it admits of no delay.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-11 The example of our Lord Jesus Christ is set before us. We must resemble him in his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. Notice the two natures of Christ; his Divine nature, and human nature. Who being in the form of God, partaking the Divine nature, as the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, Joh 1:1, had not thought it a robbery to be equal with God, and to receive Divine worship from men. His human nature; herein he became like us in all things except sin. Thus low, of his own will, he stooped from the glory he had with the Father before the world was. Christ's two states, of humiliation and exaltation, are noticed. Christ not only took upon him the likeness and fashion, or form of a man, but of one in a low state; not appearing in splendour. His whole life was a life of poverty and suffering. But the lowest step was his dying the death of the cross, the death of a malefactor and a slave; exposed to public hatred and scorn. The exaltation was of Christ's human nature, in union with the Divine. At the name of Jesus, not the mere sound of the word, but the authority of Jesus, all should pay solemn homage. It is to the glory of God the Father, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will, that all men should honour the Son as they honour the Father, Joh 5:23. Here we see such motives to self-denying love as nothing else can supply. Do we thus love and obey the Son of God?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And being found - That is, being such, or existing as a man, he humbled himself.<p>In fashion as a man - The word rendered "fashion" - &#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  sche&#772;ma - means figure, mien, deportment. Here it is the same as state, or condition. The sense is, that when he was reduced to this condition he humbled himself, and obeyed even unto death. He took upon himself all the attributes of a man. He assumed all the innocent infirmities of our nature. He appeared as other people do, was subjected to the necessity of food and clothing, like others, and was made liable to suffering, as other men are. It was still he who had been in the "form of God" who thus appeared; and, though his divine glory had been for a time laid aside, yet it was not extinguished or lost. It is important to remember, in all our meditations on the Saviour, that it was the same Being who had been invested with so much glory in heaven, that appeared on earth in the form of a man.<p>He humbled himself -  Even then, when he appeared as a man. He had not only laid aside the symbols of his glory <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, and become a man; but when he was a man, he humbled himself. Humiliation was a constant characteristic of him as a man. He did not aspire to high honors; he did not affect pomp and parade; he did not demand the service of a train of menials; but he condescended to the lowest conditions of life; <a href="/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>. The words here are very carefully chosen. In the former case <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, when he became a man, he "emptied himself," or laid aside the symbols of his glory; now, when a man, he humbled himself. That is, though he was God appearing in the form of man - a divine person on earth - yet he did not assume and assert the dignity and prerogatives appropriate to a divine being, but put himself in a condition of obedience. For such a being to obey law, implied voluntary humiliation; and the greatness of his humiliation was shown by his becoming entirely obedient, even until he died on the cross.<p>And became obedient - He subjected himself to the law of God, and wholly obeyed it; <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-9.htm">Hebrews 10:9</a>. It was a characteristic of the Redeemer that he yielded perfect obedience to the will of God. Should it be said that, if he was God himself, he must have been himself the lawgiver, we may reply that this rendered his obedience all the more wonderful and all the more meritorious. If a monarch should for an important purpose place himself in a position to obey his own laws, nothing could show in a more striking manner their importance in his view. The highest honor that has been shown to the Law of God on earth was, that it was perfectly observed by him who made the Law - the great Mediator.<p>Unto death - He obeyed even when obedience terminated in death. The point of this expression is this: One may readily and cheerfully obey another where there is no particular peril. But the case is different where obedience is attended with danger. The child shows a spirit of true obedience when he yields to the commands of a father, though it should expose him to hazard; the servant who obeys his master, when obedience is attended with risk of life; the soldier, when he is morally certain that to obey will be followed by death. Thus, many a company or platoon has been ordered into the "deadly breach," or directed to storm a redoubt, or to scale a wall, or to face a cannon, when it was morally certain that death would be the consequence. No profounder spirit of obedience can be evinced than this. It should be said, however, that the obedience of the soldier is in many cases scarcely voluntary, since, if he did not obey, death would be the penalty. But, in the case of the Redeemer, it was wholly voluntary. He placed himself in the condition of a servant to do the will of God, and then never shrank from what that condition involved.<p>Even the death of the cross - It was not such a death as a servant might incur by crossing a stream, or by failing among robbers, or by being worn out by toil; it was not such as the soldier meets when he is suddenly cut down, covered with glory as he falls; it was the long lingering, painful, humiliating death of the cross. Many a one might be willing to obey if the death that was suffered was regarded as glorious; but when it is ignominious, and of the most degrading character, and the most torturing that human ingenuity can invent, then the whole character of the obedience is changed. Yet this was the obedience the Lord Jesus evinced; and it was in this way that his remarkable readiness to suffer was shown. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. being found in fashion as a man&#8212;being already, by His "emptying Himself," in the form of a servant, or likeness of man (Ro 8:3), "He humbled Himself (still further by) becoming obedient even unto death (not as English Version, 'He humbled Himself and became,'&c.; the Greek has no 'and,' and has the participle, not the verb), and that the death of the cross." "Fashion" expresses that He had the outward guise, speech, and look. In Php 2:7, in the Greek, the emphasis is on Himself (which stands before the Greek verb), "He emptied Himself," His divine self, viewed in respect to what He had heretofore been; in Php 2:8 the emphasis is on "humbled" (which stands before the Greek "Himself"); He not only "emptied Himself" of His previous "form of God," but submitted to positive HUMILIATION. He "became obedient," namely, to God, as His "servant" (Ro 5:19; Heb 5:8). Therefore "God" is said to "exalt" Him (Php 2:9), even as it was God to whom He became voluntarily "obedient." "Even unto death" expresses the climax of His obedience (Joh 10:18).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To be <span class="bld">found</span> is a mere Hebraism, not unusual in the New Testament, not importing auy question of the thing, but only the thing certainly happening beyond expectation.

He humbled Himself, so that He became obedient unto God</span>, etc. According to the explanation of our dogmatic writers, who refer <a href="/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Php 2:6-8</a> to the <span class="ital">earthly</span> life of Christ, the sense comes to this: “<span class="ital">Christum jam inde a primo conceptionis momento divinam gloriam et majestatem sibi secundum humanam naturam communicatam plena usurpatione exserere et tanquam Deum se gerere potuisse, sed abdicasse se plenario ejus usu et humilem se exhibuisse, patrique suo coelesti obedientem factum esse usque ad mortem crucis</span>” (Quenstedt). The most thorough exposition of the passage and demonstration in this sense, though mixed with much polemical matter against the Reformed and the Socinians, are given by Calovius. The point of the orthodox view, in the interest of the full Deity of the God-man, lies in the fact that Paul is discoursing, not <span class="ital">de humiliatione</span> INCARNATIONIS, but <span class="ital">de humiliatione</span> INCARNATI. Among the Reformed theologians, Calvin and Piscator substantially agreed with our [Lutheran] orthodox expositors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On a difference in the dogmatic understanding of <a href="/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Php 2:6-8</a>, when men sought to explain more precisely the doctrine of the Church (<span class="ital">Form. Conc</span>. 8), was based the well-known controversy carried on since 1616 between the theologians of <span class="ital">Tübingen</span> and those of <span class="ital">Giessen</span>. The latter (Feuerborn and Menzer) assigned to Jesus Christ in His state of humiliation the <span class="greekheb">κτῆσις</span> of the divine attributes, but denied to Him their <span class="greekheb">χρῆσις</span>, thus making the <span class="greekheb">κένωσις</span> a renunciation of the <span class="greekheb">χρῆσις</span>. The Tübingen school, on the other hand (Thummius, Luc. Osiander, and Nicolai), not separating the <span class="greekheb">κτῆσις</span> and <span class="greekheb">χρῆσις</span>, arrived at the conclusion of a hidden and imperceptible use of the divine attributes, and consequently made the <span class="greekheb">κένωσις</span> a <span class="greekheb">κρύψις τῆς χρήσεως</span>. See the account of all the points of controversy in Dorner, II. 2, p. 661 ff., and especially Thomasius, <span class="ital">Christi Pers. u. Werk</span>, II. p. 429 ff. The Saxon <span class="ital">Decisio</span>, 1624, taking part with the Giessen divines, rejected the <span class="greekheb">κρύψις</span>, without thoroughly refuting it, and even without avoiding unnecessary concessions to it according to the <span class="ital">Formula Concordiae</span> (pp. 608, 767), so that the disputed questions remained open and the controversy itself only came to a close through final weariness. Among the dogmatic writers of the present day, Philippi is decidedly on the side of the Giessen school. See his <span class="ital">Glaubensl</span>. IV. 1, p. 279 ff. ed. 2. It is certain that, according to our passage, the idea of the <span class="greekheb">κένωσις</span> is clearly and decidedly to be maintained, and the reducing of it to a <span class="greekheb">κρύψις</span> rejected. But, since Paul expressly refers the <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε</span> to the <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ Θεοῦ</span>, and consequently to the divine mode of appearance, while he makes the <span class="greekheb">εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span> to subsist with the assumption of the <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ δουλοῦ</span>, just as subsequently the Incarnate One appears only as <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρ</span>. and as <span class="greekheb">σχήματι ὡς ἀνθρ</span>.; and since, further, in the case of the <span class="greekheb">κτήσις</span> of the divine attributes thus laid down, the non-use of them—because as divine they necessarily cannot remain dormant (<a href="/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>; <a href="/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>)—is in itself inconceivable and incompatible with the Gospel history; the <span class="greekheb">κτῆσις</span> and the <span class="greekheb">χρῆσις</span> must therefore be inseparably kept together. But, setting aside the conception of the <span class="greekheb">κρύψις</span> as foreign to the N. T., this possession and use of the divine attributes are to be conceived as having, by the renunciation of the <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ Θεοῦ</span> in virtue of the incarnation, entered upon a human development, consequently as conditioned, not as absolute, but as theanthropic. At the same time, the <span class="ital">self-consciousness</span> of Jesus Christ necessarily remained the self-consciousness of the Son of God developing Himself humanly, or (according to the Johannine phrase) of the Logos that had become flesh, who was the <span class="greekheb">μονογενὴς παρὰ πατρός</span>; see the numerous testimonies in John’s Gospel, as <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>, <a href="/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>, <a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>, <a href="/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>. “Considered from a purely exegetical point of view, there is no clearer and more certain result of the interpretation of Scripture than the proposition, that the <span class="ital">Ego</span> of Jesus on earth was identical with the <span class="ital">Ego</span> which was previously in glory with the Father; any division of the Son speaking on earth into two <span class="ital">Egos</span>, one of whom was the eternally glorious Logos, the other the humanly humble Jesus, is rejected by clear testimonies of Scripture, however intimate we may seek to conceive the marriage of the two during the earthly life of Jesus;” Liebner in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. Deutsche Theol</span>. 1858, p. 362. That which the divine Logos laid aside in the incarnation was, according to our passage, the <span class="greekheb">μορφὴ Θεοῦ</span>, that is, the divine <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> as a form of existence, and not the <span class="greekheb">εἶναι ἴσα Θεῷ</span> essentially and necessarily constituting His nature, which He retained,[115] and to which belonged, just as essentially and necessarily, the divine—and consequently in Him who had become man the divine-human—self-consciousness.[116] But as this cannot find its adequate explanation either in the <span class="ital">absolute consciousness of God</span>, or in the <span class="ital">archetypal character</span> which Schleiermacher assigned to Christ, or in the idea of the <span class="ital">religious genius</span> (Al. Schweizer), or in that of the <span class="ital">second Adam</span> created free from original sin, whose personal development proceeds as a gradual incarnation of God and deification of man (Rothe), so we must by no means say, with Gess, <span class="ital">v. d. Pers. Chr</span>. p. 304 f., that in becoming incarnate the Logos had laid aside His self-consciousness, in order to get it back again only in the gradual course of development of a human soul, and that merely in the form of a <span class="ital">human</span> self-consciousness. See, in opposition to this, Thomasius, <span class="ital">Christi Pers. u. Werk</span>, II. p. 198 f.; Schoeberlein in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. D. Th</span>. 1871, p. 471 ff., comp. the latter’s <span class="ital">Geheimnisse des Glaubens</span>, 1872, 3. The various views which have been adopted on the part of the more recent Lutheran Christologists,[117] diverging from the doctrine of the <span class="ital">Formula Concordiae</span> in setting forth Christ’s humiliation (Dorner: a gradual <span class="ital">ethical blending into one another</span> of the divine and human life in immanent development; Thomasius: <span class="ital">self-limitation, i.e</span>. partial self-renunciation of the divine Logos; Liebner: the entrance of the Logos <span class="ital">into a process of becoming</span>, that is, into a divine-human development), do not fall to be examined here in detail; they belong to the province of Dogmatics. See the discussions on the subject by Dorner, in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. Deutsche Theol</span>. 1856, 2, 1857, 2, 1858, 3; Broemel, in the <span class="ital">Kirchl.

Thus the dilemma cannot be avoided, either of supposing a <span class="ital">dual personality of Christ</span>, or of assuming, with Schoeberlein, that <span class="ital">heaven is not local</span>.

Gottmensch. das Ebenbild Gottes</span>, 1866), in unperceived direct opposition to our passage and to the entire N. T., puts the Son of God already as Son of man in absolute (not earthly) corporeality as pre-existent into the glory of heaven. From <a href="/1_corinthians/15-47.htm" title="The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.">1 Corinthians 15:47</a> the conception of the pre-existence of Christ as <span class="ital">a heavenly, pneumatic man</span> and archetype of humanity (Holsten, Biedermann, and others) can only be obtained through misapprehension of the meaning.

The Apostle goes on to describe the depth of the self-renunciation. No doubt there is here especially before Paul’s mind the contrast between what Christ “<span class="ital">is</span> in Himself and what He <span class="ital">appeared</span> in the eyes of men” (Lft[1]).—<span class="greekheb">σχήμ</span>. = Lat. <span class="ital">habitus</span>, the external bearing or fashion, “the transitory quality of our materiality” (Gore).—<span class="greekheb">εὑρεθείς</span>.

They classed Him as an <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span>. His outward guise was altogether human.—<span class="greekheb">ἐταπ</span>. Even as man He endured great humiliation, for He suffered the shameful death of the Cross. For surely <span class="greekheb">ἐταπ</span>. is more than a vivid, lively way of expressing <span class="greekheb">ἐκέν</span>. (as Weiffenb., <span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, p. 42). The rest of the verse depicts His humiliation. That consists in His obedience and the terrible issue to which it led. As obedient, He gave Himself wholly up to His Father’s will. And the course of following that will led as far as (<span class="greekheb">μέχρι</span>) death itself, no ordinary death (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span> bringing into prominence the special nature of it, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="/romans/9-30.htm" title="What shall we say then?

The Greek word <span class="ital">schêma</span> denotes appearance <span class="ital">with or without</span> underlying reality. It does not negative such reality any more than it asserts it; it emphasizes <span class="ital">appearance</span>. In the context, we have the <span class="ital">reality</span> of the Lord’s Manhood abundantly given; and in this word accordingly we read, as in the word “likeness” just above, an emphatic statement that (<span class="ital">a</span>) He was Man in guise, not in <span class="ital">dis</span>guise; presenting Himself to all the conditions of concrete life as Man with man; and that (<span class="ital">b</span>) all the while the <span class="ital">schêma</span> had more beneath it than its own corresponding reality: it was the veil of Deity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as a man</span>] Better, perhaps, <span class="bld">as man</span>, though R.V. retains “<span class="ital">as a man</span>.” As the Second Man, our Lord is rather Man, the Man of men, than a Man, one among men.—Yet the assertion here is rather as to what He was pleased to be in relation to those who “found” Him, came into contact with Him, in His earthly walk; and to such He certainly was “a man.” And so, with wonderful condescension, He speaks of Himself as “<span class="ital">a man</span> that hath told you the truth” (<a href="/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he humbled himself</span>] in “the acts of condescension and humiliation in that human nature which He emptied Himself to assume” (Ellicott). More particularly the reference is to the specially submissive, <span class="ital">bearing</span>, life, under the afflictive will of His Father, which He undertook to lead for our sakes; see the next words.

The utterance of Gethsemane was but the amazing summary and crown of His whole sacred course as the Man of Sorrows. His “Passion,” standing in some vital respects quite alone in His work, was in other respects only the apex of His “Patience.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto death</span>] R.V. rightly supplies <span class="bld">even</span> before these words. “Unto” means (by the Greek) “<span class="ital">to the length of</span>.” He did not “obey” but “abolish” <span class="ital">death</span> (<a href="/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2 Timothy 1:10</a>); He obeyed <span class="ital">His Father</span>, “even to the extent of” dying, as the sinner’s Sacrifice, at the demand of the holy Law, and “by the determinate foreknowledge” (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>) of the Lawgiver.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the cross</span>] “Far be the very name of <span class="ital">a cross</span> not only from the bodies of Roman citizens, but from their imagination, eyes, and ears” (Cicero, <span class="ital">Proverbs Rabirio</span>, c. 5. Cp. Gibbon, <span class="ital">Decline and Fall</span>, ch. xx.). Every thought of pain and shame was in the word, and was realized in the terrific thing. Combining, as we should do in the case of our Redeemer’s Crucifixion, the significance to the Jew of any death by suspension, with the significance to the Roman of execution on the cross, we must think of this supreme “obedience” as expressing the holy Sufferer’s submission both to “become a curse for us” (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>, with <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm" title="His body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>) as before <span class="ital">God</span> the Lawgiver, and meanwhile to be “despised and rejected of <span class="ital">men</span>” (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm" title="He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.">Isaiah 53:3</a>) in the most extreme degree.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the history of thought and usage in connexion with the Cross, and Crucifixion, see Zöckler’s <span class="ital">Cross of Christ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Php 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ σχήματι</span>, <span class="ital">and in fashion</span>) a distinct and lower degree of <span class="ital">emptying</span>.

He humbled himself in the Incarnation; but this was not all. The apostle has hitherto spoken of our Lord's Godhead which he had from the beginning, and of his assumption of our human nature. He now speaks of him as he appeared in the sight of men. The aorist participle, "being found (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>)," refers to the time of his earthly life when he appeared as a man among men. Fashion (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), as opposed to form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>), implies the outward and transitory. In outward appearance he was as a man; he was more, for he was God. He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death; translate, as R.V., <span class="accented">obedient.</span> The participle implies that the supreme act of self-humiliation consisted in the Lord's voluntary submission to death. the obedience of his perfect life extended even unto death. "He taketh away [literally,  'beareth,' <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] the sin of the world;" "The wages of sin is death;" therefore he suffered death for the sin which, himself sinless, he vouchsafed to bear. Here we may remark in passing that this connection of death with sin must have made death all the more awful to our sinless Lord. Even the death of the cross. No ordinary death, but of all forms of death the most torturing, the most full of shame - a death reserved by the Romans for slaves, a death accursed in the eyes of the Jews (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Being found in fashion as a man (&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Some expositors connect these words with the preceding clause, thus: being made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man; a new sentence beginning with He humbled Himself. The general sense is not altered by this change, and there is great force in Meyer's remark that the preceding thought, in the likeness of men, is thus "emphatically exhausted." On the other hand, it breaks the connection with the following sentence, which thus enters very abruptly. Notice being found. After He had assumed the conditions of humanity, and men's attention was drawn to Him, they found Him like a man. Compare <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>. "If we looked at Him, there was no sightliness that we should delight in Him."<p>Fashion (&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;). That which is purely outward and appeals to the senses. The form of a servant is concerned with the fact that the manifestation as a servant corresponded with the real fact that Christ came as the servant of mankind. In the phrase in the likeness of men the thought is still linked with that of His essential nature which rendered possible a likeness to men, but not an absolute identity with men. In being found in fashion as a man the thought is confined to the outward guise as it appealed to the sense of mankind. Likeness states the fact of real resemblance to men in mode of existence: fashion defines the outward mode and form. As a man. Not being found a man not what He was recognized to be, but as a man, keeping up the idea of semblance expressed in likeness.<p>He humbled Himself (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Not the same as emptied Himself, <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>.

Unto. The Rev. very judiciously inserts even; for the A.V. is open to the interpretation that Christ rendered obedience to death. Unto is up to the point of. Christ's obedience to God was rendered to the extent of laying down His life.<p>Of the cross<p>Forming a climax of humiliation. He submitted not only to death, but to the death of a malefactor. The Mosaic law had uttered a curse against it, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, and the Gentiles reserved it for malefactors and slaves. Hence the shame associated with the cross, <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>. This was the offense or stumbling-block of the cross, which was so often urged by the Jews against the Christians. See on <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>. To a Greek, accustomed to clothe his divinities with every outward attribute of grace and beauty, the summons to worship a crucified malefactor appealed as foolishness, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>. </body></html>
