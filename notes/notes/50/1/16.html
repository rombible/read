The growth of a secret society (for such Christianity was held to be) among them might easily induce greater severity towards a leader of the sect.

These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The one preach Christ of contention - So as to form parties, and to produce strifes among his professed followers.<p>Not sincerely - Not "purely" - &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;  hagno&#772;s - not with pure motives or intentions.

How they did this is unknown. Perhaps they were those who were strongly imbued with Jewish notions, and who felt that his course tended to diminish respect for the law of Moses, and who now took this opportunity to promote their views, knowing that this would be particularly painful to him when he was not at liberty to meet them openly, and to defend his own opinions. It is possible also that they may have urged that Paul himself had met with a signal reproof for the course which he had taken, and, as a consequence, was now thrown into chains. Bloomfield suggests that it was the opinion of many of the ancient expositors that they endeavored to do this by so preaching as to excite the fury of the multitude or the rulers against Paul, and to produce increased severity in his punishment. But the way in which they did this is unknown, and conjecture is altogether useless. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17.

But the others out of contention (or rather, 'a factious spirit'; 'cabal'; a spirit of intrigue, using unscrupulous means to compass their end; 'self-seeking' [Alford]) proclaim (the Greek is not the same as that for 'preach,' but, 'announce') Christ, not sincerely (answering to 'but of a spirit of intrigue,' or 'self-seeking'). Literally, 'not purely'; not with a pure intention; the Jewish leaven they tried to introduce was in order to glorify themselves (Ga 6:12, 13; however, see on [2380]Php 1:18), thinking (but in vain) to raise up (so the oldest manuscripts read) tribulation to my bonds." Their thought was, that taking the opportunity of my being laid aside, they would exalt themselves by their Judaizing preaching, and depreciate me and my preaching, and so cause me trouble of spirit in my bonds; they thought that I, like themselves, sought my own glory, and so would be mortified at their success over mine.

This was the <span class="ital">cabal</span> in the background of their <span class="ital">dishonest</span> preaching. That by the spread of the gospel they desired to provoke the hostility of the heathen, especially of Nero, against Paul, and thus to render his captivity more severe, is a groundless conjecture imported (Erasmus, Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, and others; comp. already Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Pelagius).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">ἐγείρειν</span> (see the critical remarks) comp. <span class="greekheb">ἐγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὠδῖνας</span>, Plat. <span class="ital">Theaet</span>. p. 149 C, and similar passages.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/philippians/1-16.htm" title="The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:...">Php 1:16-17</a>.

But the suggestion seems to us not altogether probable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How did the persons in question expect to “raise up trouble” for the imprisoned Apostle? By preventing the access of enquirers or converts to him, unable as he was to go after them. Loyal fellow-workers would have made it a point to bring their hearers under the personal influence of the great Messenger of Christ, and also into a connexion of order with him. Every instance in which the opposite was done was fitted to try severely the spirit of St Paul; to afflict him in and through his position of restraint.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-16.htm" title="The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:">Php 1:16</a>.[9] <span class="greekheb">Ἐξ ἐριθείας</span>, <span class="ital">of contention</span>) Construed with <span class="ital">preach</span>.—<span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἁγνῶς</span>, <span class="ital">not sincerely</span>) not with a pure intention, or, not without a Jewish leaven; comp. <a href="/context/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ....">Galatians 6:12-13</a>.
