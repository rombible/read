It implies an intense and almost painful longing for some crisis, a dulness of suspense lighted up with hope. The phrase is one of the many indications that the joyful and confident tone so often noticed in this Epistle came not from the absence of yearning for the freedom and activity of apostolic life, but from the victory over such longings through faith. Whatever the crisis might be, St. Paul looked eagerly for it.<p><span class= "bld">In nothing I shall be ashamed.</span>—The phrase is elsewhere used by St. Paul with especial reference to the shame which comes from hopes disappointed and professions unfulfilled. (See <a href="/2_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.">2Corinthians 7:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.">2Corinthians 9:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:">2Corinthians 10:8</a>. Compare also the quotation from <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a> in <a href="/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1Peter 2:6</a>.) For (he says) “hope (fulfilled) maketh not ashamed” (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>). So probably here; he trusts that in the hour of trial the confidence which he has felt and professed of being “able to do all things through Christ who strengthenth him” (see <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm" title="I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.">Philippians 4:13</a>) may not come to shameful failure, but may “magnify Christ in all boldness of speech.” There is a subtle touch of true Christian feeling in the fact that, when he speaks of the chance of failure, he uses the first person: “I shall be ashamed;” but when of triumph, it is “Christ shall be magnified” in me. If he fails, it must be through his own fault; if he triumphs, it will be through his Master’s strength.<p><span class= "bld">In my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span>—“In my body:” The phrase is, no doubt, suggested mainly by the idea of death—the death of a martyr in bodily torture or shame. There is the same connection of idea in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a> : “always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, so that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body.” But while the word “flesh” is used in the New Testament in a bad sense, the “body” is always regarded as that in which we may “glorify God” (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>) by word and deed. It is not merely a vesture of the soul, but a part of the true man (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1Thessalonians 5:23</a>), having membership of Christ, and being the temple of the Holy Ghost (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15-19</a>). In this passage the whole idea is of Christ in him; hence his body is spoken of as simply the tabernacle of the indwelling presence of Christ, and devoted only to “magnify” Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to my earnest expectation - The word used here occurs but in one other place in the New Testament; see it explained in the notes at <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>. The earnest desire and hope which Paul had was not, primarily, that he might be released; but it was that, in all circumstances, he might be able to honor the gospel, living or dying. To that he looked as a much more important matter than to save his life. Life with him was the secondary consideration; the main thing was, to stand up everywhere as the advocate of the gospel, to maintain its truth, and to exhibit its spirit.<p>That in nothing I shall be ashamed - That I shall do nothing of which I shall have occasion to be ashamed. That in these heavy trials, I may not be left to deny the truth of the Christian religion; that, even before the emperor, I may maintain its principles; and that the dread of death may not lead me to do a dishonorable thing, or in any way so to shrink from an avowal of my belief, as to give me or my friends occasion of regret.<p>But that with all boldness - By my speaking the truth, and maintaining my principles with all boldness; see the <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a> note; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19-20</a> notes.<p>Christ shall be magnified - Shall be held up to the view of man as the true and only Saviour, whatever becomes of me.<p>Whether it be by life - If I am permitted to live. He was not yet certain how the case would terminate with him. He had not been put on his trial, and, whether that trial would result in his acquittal or not, he could not certainly know. But he felt assured that, if he was acquitted, the effect would be to honor Christ. He would ascribe his deliverance to his gracious interposition; he would devote himself with new ardor to his service; and he felt assured, from his past efforts, that he would be able to do something that would "magnify" Christ in the estimation of mankind.<p>Or by death - If my trial shall result in my death. Then, he believed he would be able to show such a spirit as to do honor to Christ and his cause. He was not afraid to die, and he was persuaded that he would be enabled to bear the pains of death in such a manner as to show the sustaining power of religion, and the value of Christianity. Christ is magnified in the death of Christians, when his gospel is seen to sustain them; when, supported by its promises, they are enabled to go calmly into the dark valley; and when, in the departing moments, they confidently commit their eternal all into his hands. The effect of this state of feeling on the mind of Paul must have been most happy. In whatever way his trial terminated, he felt assured that the great object for which he lived would be promoted. Christ would be honored, perhaps, as much by his dying as a martyr, as by his living yet many years to proclaim his gospel. He was, therefore, reconciled to his lot. He had no anxiety. Come what might, the purpose which he had most at heart would be secured, and the name of the Saviour would be honored. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. According to my earnest expectation&#8212;The Greek expresses, "expectation with uplifted head (Lu 21:28) and outstretched neck." Ro 8:19 is the only other place in the New Testament that the word occurs. Tittmann says, in both places it implies not mere expectation, but the anxious desire of an anticipated prosperous issue in afflictive circumstances. The subject of his earnest expectation which follows, answers to "my salvation" (Php 1:19).<p>in nothing I shall be ashamed&#8212;in nothing have reason to be ashamed of "my work for God, or His work in me" [Alford]. Or, "in nothing be disappointed in my hope, but that I may fully obtain it" [Estius].

These words are so placed as that they may refer both to what goes before and what follows after; and the sense be either that the apostle had earnest expectation and hope, even a strong confidence of his salvation, or deliverance from his confinement; and also of his having an interest in the prayers of the saints, and that hereby a supply of the Spirit would be given him; for as he knew and was sure that his God would supply the wants of others, he had great reason to believe he would supply his own; and especially since he had been told by Christ that his grace was sufficient for him: or as in connection with what follows; he had a full persuasion that he should not be put to shame on any account, <p>that in nothing I shall be ashamed; not of his hope, neither the grace of hope, which makes not ashamed; nor the object of hope, Christ Jesus; nor the thing hoped for, eternal life and happiness, or any of the above things about which this grace was conversant; nor of his reproaches and sufferings for the sake of Christ and his Gospel, which he esteemed as an honour to him, as jewels in his crown, as chains of gold about his neck, and as great riches; nor of the Gospel which he preached, so as to retract and deny it, drop the whole, or conceal any part of it, lay down his profession of it, or cease to preach it: "but" his earnest desire and his firm hope and faith were, <p>that with all boldness, as always; that as he had, so he should continue to use boldness in the exercise of faith at the throne of grace, come with freedom thither, and stand before God with intrepidity, through the blood and righteousness of his Son; and that as he had met with afflictions and sufferings for Christ's sake, with cheerfulness and an undaunted spirit, none of these things had moved him, so he believed he never should; and that as he had all along, throughout the whole course of his ministry, preached the Gospel with plainness, openness, and freedom, without any guise or reserve, and that with an holy courage and boldness in the face of all opposition, <p>so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body; for this being Christ's, his great concern was to glorify him in it; and though it was a poor, weak, and crazy body, yet rich treasure being put into this earthen vessel, Christ had been greatly magnified, extolled, and made very high in it; never was there, as the apostle, such a magnifier of Christ, by preaching him in the transcendent glories of his person as the Son of God, in the riches of his grace as Mediator, in all his offices of prophet, priest, and King; and particularly in the justification and salvation of men, where he made him to be all in all. Christ was also magnified by him, by his life and conversation, which influenced by his grace, was in obedience to his will, was directed to his glory, was as became his Gospel, and what adorned his doctrine in all things; and also by enduring such hardships and so great sufferings on his account; the power of Christ was greatly magnified in supporting him under them, and carrying him through them; and as this had been the case ever since he was in the ministry, it being the main thing he had in view, he had a well grounded hope and confidence, that it would ever be so: <p>whether it be by life or by death; that is, should he live longer, should he be delivered from his present confinement, and be spared a little longer among men, he comfortably assured Christ would be magnified by him in his body, and as long as he was in it; for his determination was to preach him and him only, to spend his life in his service, and to seek not his own things, but the things of Christ; or should he be put to death quickly by the order of Nero, he doubted not but Christ would have some glory thereby; he should die calling upon his name with fervency, professing his constant and unshaken faith in him, and sealing the Gospel by his blood, with the greatest cheerfulness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> According to my earnest expectation and <i>my</i> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <i>that</i> with all boldness, as always, <i>so</i> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether <i>it be</i> by life, or by death.</span><p>(6) We must continue even to the end, with great confidence, having nothing before our eyes except for Christ's glory alone, whether we live or die.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.">Php 1:20</a>.

Huther), that is, be found unfaithful to his office, or deficient in the discharge of its duties to the glorifying of Christ. The connection requires a description, not of Paul’s <span class="ital">behaviour</span>, but of the <span class="ital">fate</span> in which the <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> of <a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a> would issue for him.

Wunder, <span class="ital">ad Soph. Phil</span>. 141 f. The <span class="ital">subject</span> of the freeness is <span class="ital">Paul himself</span>, inasmuch as it was in his <span class="ital">body</span> that the fearless glorifying of Christ was to be manifested (see below); but he expresses himself in the <span class="ital">passive</span> (<span class="greekheb">μεγαλυνθήσεται</span>) and not in the <span class="ital">active</span>, because, in the feeling of his being the organ of divine working, the <span class="greekheb">μοι ἀποβήσεται εἰς σωτηρίαν</span> (<a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>) governs his conceptions and determines his expression. Hofmann’s view, that <span class="greekheb">ἐν π</span>. <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησ</span>. means “in full <span class="ital">publicity</span>,” as an unmistakeable fact before the eyes of all, is linguistically erroneous. See, in opposition to it, on <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς πάντοτε καὶ νῦν</span>] so that the present circumstances, however inimical they are in part towards me (<a href="/context/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:...">Php 1:15-18</a>), will therefore bring about no other result than this most happy one for me, which has always taken place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ σώματί μου</span>] instead of saying: <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐμοί</span>, he says: <span class="ital">in my body</span>, because the decision was now close at hand, whether his body should remain alive or be put to death. But whichever of these possible alternatives should come to pass, he earnestly expected and hoped that the glory of Christ would be thereby secured (<span class="greekheb">εἴτε διὰ ζωῆς εἴτε διὰ θανάτου</span>), in so far, namely, as <span class="ital">through his remaining in the body</span> his apostolic labours would be continued to the glory of Christ, and <span class="ital">by the slaying of his body</span> there would take place, not the mere closing of his witness for Christ, as Hofmann, in opposition to the text (<a href="/context/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain....">Php 1:21-23</a>), refines away this point, but his union with Christ. Thus, therefore, he will not be put to shame even by his death; but, on the contrary, Christ will be freely glorified by it, namely, <span class="ital">practically glorified, inasmuch as Paul, conscious of the great gain which he shall acquire through death</span> (<a href="/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Php 1:21</a>), <span class="ital">will with unwavering joyfulness</span>—with the frank joyful courage of the martyr who is being perfected—<span class="ital">die to the glorifying of Christ</span>. Comp. <a href="/john/21-19.htm" title="This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him, Follow me.">John 21:19</a>. In any case, accordingly, the result must ensue, that <span class="ital">in his body</span>, just as it has always hitherto been the living personal instrument of Christ’s glory, now also the free glorification of Christ shall be made manifest, whether this result be secured <span class="ital">through its being preserved alive or being slain;</span> “nam et corpus <span class="ital">loquitur</span> et corpus <span class="ital">moritur</span>,” Grotius. Hoelemann erroneously refers <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ παῤῥ</span>. to the bold preaching of the various <span class="ital">teachers</span> described in <a href="/context/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:...">Php 1:15-18</a>, from which now, as always, the glory of Christ shall result; and that indeed, through the influence which such a fearless working would have on the fate of the apostle, in his <span class="ital">body</span>, whether Christ grant to him a longer course of life or death, in either of which cases the Lord will manifest Himself to him as <span class="ital">augustissimum auxiliatorem</span>. But against this view it may be urged, that <span class="greekheb">ἐν οὐδενί</span> does not refer to the teachers (see above); that <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησίᾳ</span> is the contrast to <span class="greekheb">αἰσχυνθήσομαι</span>, so that the subject of the latter must be also the subject of the former; and lastly, that Paul would thus be made to say that the fearless working of others had <span class="ital">always</span> shown forth Christ’s honour <span class="ital">in his body</span>,—an expression which, as regards the last point, might be suited to the <span class="ital">present</span> position of the apostle, but not to the <span class="greekheb">ὡς πάντοτε</span>. Rilliet takes <span class="greekheb">μεγαλυνθήσεται</span> not in the sense of <span class="ital">praising</span> (<a href="/luke/1-46.htm" title="And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,">Luke 1:46</a>; <a href="/acts/5-13.htm" title="And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.">Acts 5:13</a>; <a href="/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.

But <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ παῤῥησίᾳ</span> would be an <span class="ital">inappropriate</span> definition of this idea; and <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ σώματί μου</span> would also be <span class="ital">inappropriate</span>, as if Christ would have, even by the apostle’s <span class="ital">death</span>, to grow in his body; lastly, neither the foregoing nor the subsequent context points to the peculiar mystical idea of a <span class="ital">growth of Christ in the human body;</span> while the similar idea in <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a> is there very peculiarly and clearly suggested by the <span class="ital">context</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.">Php 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαραδ</span>.

The verb <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαραδοκεῖν</span> is found in Polyb., Plut., Joseph., Aquila.—<span class="greekheb">αἰσχυνθ</span>. very probably refers, in the main, to his own conduct, the danger of denying his Lord under stress of hardships, but there is also involved the thought of Christ’s treatment of him. This gives the true antithesis to <span class="greekheb">μεγαλυνθ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">παρρησίᾳ</span>. We are inclined to believe that <span class="greekheb">π</span>. has its literal meaning, boldness of speech, for he has before him the danger of denying Christ. Of course there is implied the idea of courage in his whole bearing. The word is typical of the attitude of the early Christians.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν</span>. His trial is in process.—<span class="greekheb">μεγαλ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">θανάτου</span>. There is some force in Meyer’s suggestion that passive verbs are used here because Paul feels himself the organ of Divine working. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ σώμ</span>. “In my person.” <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. in Paul is always a colourless word, the organ of the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span> or the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, and taking its character from its constituting principle. If he lives, it will be for the service of Christ, which is the highest honour he can pay his Lord.
