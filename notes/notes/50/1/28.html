The effect which it had on the heathen themselves is shown even by the affected contempt with which the Stoics spoke of it, as a kind of “madness,” a morbid “habit,” a sheer “obstinacy.” (See Epictetus, iv. 7; Marc.

The original word conversation denotes the conduct of citizens who seek the credit, safety, peace, and prosperity of their city. There is that in the faith of the gospel, which is worth striving for; there is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man may sleep and go to hell; but he who would go to heaven, must look about him and be diligent. There may be oneness of heart and affection among Christians, where there is diversity of judgment about many things. Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ; the ability and disposition to believe are from God. And if we suffer reproach and loss for Christ, we are to reckon them a gift, and prize them accordingly. Yet salvation must not be ascribed to bodily afflictions, as though afflictions and worldly persecutions deserved it; but from God only is salvation: faith and patience are his gifts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries - Adversaries, or opponents, they had, like most of the other early Christians. There were Jews there who would be likely to oppose them (compare <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>), and they were exposed to persecution by the pagan. In that city, Paul had himself suffered much <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/16.htm">Acts 16</a>; and it would not be strange if the same scenes should be repeated. It is evident from this passage, as well as from some other parts of the Epistle, that the Philippians were at this time experiencing some form of severe suffering. But in what way, or why, the opposition to them was excited, is nowhere stated. The meaning here is, "do not be alarmed at anything which they can do. Maintain your Christian integrity, notwithstanding all the opposition which they can make. They will, in the end, certainly be destroyed, and you will be saved."<p>Which is to them an evident token of perdition - What, it may be asked, would be the token of their perdition? What is the evidence to which Paul refers that they will be destroyed? The relative "which" -  &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  he&#772;tis; - is probably used as referring to the persecution which had been commenced, and to the constancy which the apostle supposed the Philippians would evince. The sentence is elliptical; but it is manifest that the apostle refers either to the circumstance then occurring, that they were persecuted, and that they evinced constancy; or to the constancy which he wished them to evince in their persecutions. He says that this circumstance of persecution, if they evinced such a spirit as he wished, would be to them an evidence of two things:<p>(1) Of the destruction of those who were engaged in the persecution. This would be, because they knew that such persecutors could not ultimately prevail. Persecution of the church would be a certain indication that they who did it would be finally destroyed.<p>(2) it would be a proof of their own salvation, because it would show that they were the friends of the Redeemer; and they had the assurance that all those who were persecuted for his sake would be saved. The gender of the Greek relative here is determined by the following noun (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  endeixis), in a manner that is not uncommon in Greek; see Wetstein, in loc., and Koppe.<p>And that of God - That is, their persecution is a proof that God will interpose in due time and save you. The hostility of the wicked to us is one evidence that we are the friends of God, and shall be saved. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. terrified&#8212;literally, said of horses or other animals startled or suddenly scared; so of sudden consternation in general.<p>which&#8212;your not being terrified.<p>evident token of perdition&#8212;if they would only perceive it (2Th 1:5).

So Diod. Sic., xvii., 34, 6, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν περὶ αὐτοὺς σωρευομένων νεκρῶν πτυρόμενοι</span>. It is found in Plut., <span class="ital">Reipub. Ger. Praec.</span>, p. 800, of a multitude. See Kypke <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>—<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀντικειμ</span>. Who are their adversaries? In <a href="/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Php 1:30</a> he speaks of them as having the same conflict as <span class="ital">he</span> had when at Philippi and now has at Rome. In both these instances, most probably, his opponents were heathen. Further, when warning his readers against Jewish malice, what he usually fears is not that they will be terrified into compliance, but that they will be seduced from the right path. And, as Franke (Myr[78]5 <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>) points out, the conflict here is for the <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, not for the <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> of the Gospel. It is no argument against this that some of his reasoning would only have force for Jews, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, suffering as a gift of God (so Holst., <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. prot. Th.</span>, 1875, p. 444). For he is speaking of the impression made upon them (the Philippians), and he uses Christian modes of expression. Probably therefore he thinks chiefly of their heathen antagonists, as, in any case, Jews seem to have formed a very small minority of the population. The pagans of Philippi, on the other hand, would struggle hard against a faith which condemned all idol-worship, for the extant remains at Philippi and in its neighbourhood show that they were an extraordinarily devout community. See esp[79] Heuzey et Daumet, <span class="ital">Mission Archéologique de Macédoine</span>, pp. iii., 84–86. At the same time we cannot exclude the possibility that he had non-Christian Jews in his mind as well.—<span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span>. “Inasmuch as this” (<span class="ital">sc.</span>, the fact of their not being terrified). The relative is, as frequently, attracted to its predicate. So <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span>, agreeing with <span class="greekheb">ἐνδ</span>., for <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>. In the following words the true reading is <span class="greekheb">ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς</span>. That of <span class="ital">TR.</span> has arisen for the sake of symmetry with the succeeding clause.—<span class="greekheb">ἔνδειξις</span>. An Attic law-term. In N.T. only in Paul. Not found in LXX. It denotes proof obtained by an appeal to facts. See SH[80] on <a href="/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπώλεια</span> has its usual Pauline antithesis <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>. Paul has never defined <span class="greekheb">ἀπώλεια</span>.—All edd. read <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν δέ</span>. Not only is it better attested (see crit. note), but it also deserves preference as being the harder reading and sufficient to explain the other. It really includes <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>. The emphasis in Paul’s mind changes from the persons to their destinies. It was quite natural to assimilate <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> to <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span> preceding. But there is also the thought that <span class="ital">they</span> (the adversaries) will be affected not only by the proof of their own destruction, but also by that of the Philippians’ salvation.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> seems to refer to <span class="greekheb">ἔνδειξις</span>. “If God be for us, who can be against us?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[77] especially.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[78] Meyer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] especially.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] Sanday and Headlam (<span class="ital">Romans</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/philippians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">terrified</span>] More precisely, <span class="bld">scared</span>. The verb (found here only in N.T., and nowhere in LXX. and Apocrypha) is used in classical Greek of the starting, or “shying,” of frightened animals, and thence of alarm in general. The word would specially suit the experience of the “little flock” in violent Philippi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which is to them</span> &c.] He means that the whole phenomenon of this union, stedfastness, energy, and calm of the saints in face of seemingly hopeless odds, is in itself an omen of the issue. Of course the statement is made not in the abstract, but in the particular case of the Gospel. Many a false and finally losing cause may conceivably be maintained for a time courageously and calmly. But the Apostle assumes that the Gospel <span class="ital">is</span> the eternal truth, sure of ultimate victory, and then says here that the realization of this fact, in the convictions of both its foes and its friends, will be all the more impressive the more the Church acts in the spirit of calm, united, decisive resolution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">perdition</span>] in its deepest and most awful sense; the eternal loss and ruin of all persistent opponents of God and His truth. So below, <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm" title="Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)">Php 3:19</a>; and so always in N.T., excepting only <a href="/matthew/26-8.htm" title="But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?">Matthew 26:8</a>; <a href="/mark/14-4.htm" title="And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?">Mark 14:4</a>; where the word means waste, spoiling, loss of a material thing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">salvation</span>] This word also bears its deepest sense here. The faithful believer, witness, and worker, is on the way to eternal glory; and the prospect brightens in anticipation and realization as the company of such disciples unites around, and in, the cause of Jesus Christ. On the word “<span class="ital">salvation</span>” see note above, on <a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and that</span>] “<span class="ital">That</span>” in the Greek, refers not immediately to the word “salvation” but to the whole previous idea, of <span class="ital">opposition met in a way to encourage faith</span>.

"The christian gladiator does not anxiously await the signal of life or death from the fickle crowd. The great Director of the contest Himself has given him a sure token of deliverance." </body></html>
