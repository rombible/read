As connected with the word “brethren,” they are unmeaning; whereas St. Paul constantly uses them (especially in these Epistles), generally with a verb or verbal adjective, and always to convey some distinct idea. That the words “in my bonds” follow constitutes no difficulty. “In the Lord” expresses the ground of confidence; “in my bonds” simply the occasion and circumstances.<p><span class= "bld">Waxing confident by my bonds.</span>—There is a two-fold sense here, corresponding to the two-fold division of preachers made below. Those who preached Christ “of contention” trusted in St. Paul’s captivity as giving them scope; those who preached “of good will” found in it a striking example of evil overruled to good, and so gained from it fresh encouragement.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And many of the brethren - Many Christians. It is evident from this, that there were already "many" in Rome who professed Christianity.<p>In the Lord - In the Lord Jesus; that is, united to him and to each other by a professed attachment to him. This is a common phrase to, designate Christians.<p>Waxing confident by my bonds - Becoming increasingly bold and zealous in consequence of my being confined. This might have been either:<p>(1) that from the very fact that so distinguished a champion of the truth had been imprisoned, they were excited to do all they could in the cause of the gospel. Or,<p>(2) they were aroused by the fact that the cause of his imprisonment had become generally understood, and that there was a strong current of popular favor setting toward Christianity in consequence of it. Or,<p>(3) they had had contact with Paul in his own "hired house," and had been incited and encouraged by him to put forth great efforts in the cause. Or,<p>(4) it would seem that some had been emboldened to promulgate their views, and set themselves up as preachers, who would have been restrained if Paul had been at liberty.<p>They were disposed to form parties, and to secure followers, and rejoiced in an opportunity to increase their own popularity, and were not unwilling thus to diminish the popularity and lessen the influence of so great a man as Paul. Had he been at liberty, they would have had no prospect of success; see <a href="/philippians/1-16.htm">Philippians 1:16</a>. To this may be added a suggestion by Theodoret. "Many of the brethren have increased boldness - &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  tharsos - on account of my bonds. For seeing me bear such hard things with pleasure, they announce that the gospel (which sustains me) is divine." The same sentiment occurs in Oecumen, and Theophylact; see Bloomfield. In Paul himself they had an illustration of the power of religion, and being convinced of its truth, they went and proclaimed it abroad.<p>To speak the word without fear - That is, they see that I remain safely (compare <a href="/acts/28-30.htm">Acts 28:30</a>), and that there is no danger of persecution, and, stimulated by my sufferings and patience, they go and make the gospel known. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

This is another instance of the usefulness of the apostle's sufferings, and another proof of their being for the furtherance of the Gospel; they were not only the means of the conversion of many that were without, but were very encouraging and strengthening to them that were within the church, and to many that were in the ministry; who are called "brethren", some real, others nominal; being partakers of the grace of God, at least in profession, or otherwise they would not have been fit to have been ministers of the word, nor members of a Gospel church, which was necessary to their being regularly sent forth; and whom the apostle calls and owns as brethren in the ministry, being sent forth by Christ, at least some of them, and having the same commission to preach the Gospel as he had; though they had not equal gifts and qualifications with him: he styles them brethren "in the Lord", to distinguish them from the Jews at Rome, who were his brethren according to the flesh; and to express their spiritual character and relation, and point out the work of the Lord, in which they were jointly concerned with him: now though not all the brethren, yet many of them were greatly affected with, and influenced by the apostle's patient and cheerfully suffering for Christ; insomuch that, as he says, <p>waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear; or as some read it, "waxing confident in the Lord"; connecting the phrase, "in the Lord", with this word, and so make the ground and object of their confidence the Lord; whose presence, power, grace, and Spirit, emboldened them the more by the apostle's bonds to preach the Gospel with courage and intrepidity; the Lord being on their side, and their helper, they feared not what men could do unto them; or else being animated by the apostle's patience and firmness of mind in suffering, and by the use they saw his bonds were of for the spread of the Gospel, they took heart and courage to "speak the word"; the word "of God", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read; and so the Alexandrian, Claromontane, and two of Stephens's copies: meaning either the essential word, the Lord Jesus Christ, who was the subject of their ministry; or the written word, the writings of Moses and the prophets, the books of the Old Testament, according to which they spoke; or the Gospel, called often the word, and sometimes with an addition, the word of truth, the word of faith, the word of reconciliation, the word of righteousness, the word of life, and the word of our salvation, from the several subjects of it: this they spake boldly and freely, as it ought to be spoken, and "without fear", not without fear and reverence of God, whose word it is; nor of themselves and their own weakness and inabilities, which cause much fear and trembling; but without the fear of man, which brings a snare; they had no regard to the threats and menaces, the reproaches and persecutions of men; none of these things moved them; they feared God and not man, and so went on boldly, preaching the Gospel; which is related with pleasure, as a fruit and effect of the apostle's sufferings, and which he doubted not would be very delightful to the Philippians to hear of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> word without fear.</span><p>(k) The Gospel is called the word, to set forth the excellence of it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-14.htm" title="And many of the brothers in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.">Php 1:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοὺς πλείονας</span>] the <span class="ital">majority</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm" title="But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>, <span class="ital">et al</span>.

As the apostle’s bonds had become generally known as <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, so also <span class="ital">in Christ</span> (who will not abandon the work of His prisoner that had thus become so manifest) may be found the just ground of the confidence which encourages the brethren, Paul’s fellow-Christians in Rome, <span class="greekheb">ἀφόβως τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν</span>.

Weiss explains as if the passage ran <span class="greekheb">τῇ φανερώσει τῶν δεσμῶν μου</span> (which would tend to the recommendation of the gospel); while Hofmann thinks that, to guard themselves <span class="ital">against the danger of being criminally prosecuted on account of their preaching</span>, they relied on the apostle’s imprisonment, in so far as the latter had <span class="ital">now</span> shown itself, in the <span class="ital">judicial process that had at length been commenced</span>, to be <span class="ital">solely on account of Christ</span>, and not <span class="ital">for anything culpable</span>. The essential elements, forsooth, are thus introduced in consequence of the way in which Hofmann has construed for himself the situation (see on <a href="/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Php 1:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περισσοτ</span>.] <span class="ital">i.e</span>. in a higher degree than they had formerly ventured upon, before I lay here in bonds.

But the reason of the increased <span class="greekheb">ἀφοβία</span> lay <span class="ital">deeper</span>, in the sphere of the <span class="ital">moral</span> idea, which manifested itself in the apostle’s bonds, and in accordance with which they trusted those bonds <span class="ital">in the Lord</span>, seeing them borne for <span class="ital">the Lord’s</span> sake.

Vaughan holds that “from the universal practice of deciding matters by the vote of a majority the term comes to mean <span class="ital">the main body</span>, the society <span class="ital">as a whole</span>,” but this scarcely seems needful.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν Κ</span>.

It is difficult to see where the tautology, which is said to be involved in this interpretation, comes in. Probably it is an almost technical combination. Dsm[26] (<span class="ital">BS</span>[27], p. 82) notes from Papyri a precisely similar technical use of <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφός</span> in the language of the Serapeum at Memphis.—<span class="greekheb">πεποιθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δεσμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span>. “Having confidence in my bonds,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, being encouraged by the favourable light in which his imprisonment was beginning to be regarded when seen in its true character.

Hpt[28] believes that <span class="greekheb">λαλ</span>. is used here expressly instead of <span class="greekheb">λέγειν</span> as emphasising the physiological process rather than the word spoken. In the later language these refinements were apt to be overlooked. Still it is interesting to find that in LXX <span class="greekheb">דָבַר</span> is almost invariably transl. by <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">אָמַר</span> by <span class="greekheb">λέγειν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[21] Alford’s <span class="ital">Greek Testament</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[22] Weiss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[23] Lightfoot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[24]ips.

It is noticeable that the Apostle should imply that there were exceptions. Possibly, he refers here to what comes out more clearly below, the difference between friendly and unfriendly sections among the Roman Christians. We can scarcely doubt (in view of Romans 16 and Acts 28) that the friendly were the majority. If so, St Paul may here practically say that a majority of the brethren were energized into fresh efforts, by his imprisonment, while a minority, also stirred into new activity, were acting on less worthy motives. In view of the context, this seems more likely than that he should merely imply by this phrase that the revival of activity was not universal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In any case, this verse implies that a spirit of languor and timidity had recently infected the believing community at Rome.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the brethren in the Lord</span>] So also R.V. Bps Ellicott and Lightfoot connect the words here otherwise; “<span class="ital">the brethren, having in the Lord confidence</span>, &c.” Grammatically, either is possible. But to us the “rhythm of the sentence,” a sort of evidence not easy to define and explain, but a real item for decision, seems to plead for the connexion in the text. It is true that the precise phrase “brethren in the Lord” is not found elsewhere. But a near parallel is <a href="/romans/16-13.htm" title="Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.">Romans 16:13</a>, “Rufus, the chosen one in the Lord”; for there too the words “in the Lord” are in a certain sense superfluous. See too <a href="/romans/16-8.htm" title="Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.">Romans 16:8</a>; <a href="/romans/16-10.htm" title="Salute Apelles approved in Christ.

The “confidence was, in a sense, reposed “in,” or on, Paul’s chains, his captivity, just so far as that captivity vividly reminded the Roman believers of the sacredness and goodness of the cause, and of the Person, for whose sake the Apostle unflinchingly incurred it and willingly bore it.

Waxing confident by my bonds</span>. The words, "in the Lord," are perhaps better taken with being "confident." Their confidence rests upon St. Paul's bonds, but it is in the Lord.

The boldness required to profess Christ within the precincts of the palace is illustrated by the graffito or wall-scribble discovered in 1857 among the ruins on the Palatine. It is a caricature of Christ on the cross, with an ass's head, while on the left appears a christian youth in an attitude of adoration.
