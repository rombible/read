The words “joy” and “rejoice” occur no less than thirteen times in this short Epistle; they express what his own feeling is, and what he desires that theirs should be.<p>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">I thank my God . . .</span>—These verses more accurately rendered will run thus: <span class= "ital">I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you at all times, in every prayer of mine for you all, uttering that prayer with</span> <span class= "ital">joy</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>with joyful confidence. The sense, however, is not materially altered. The emphatic earnestness of thanksgiving is seen in the reiteration which runs through the passage, and its absolute universality of scope is no less clearly marked. The closest parallel is again in the Epistles to the Thessalonians (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2Thessalonians 2:3</a>), although in every Epistle, except the Epistle to the Galatians, there is an opening of thanksgiving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/philippians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,...">Php 1:3-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">I thank my God upon every remembrance </span>— Or <span class="ital">mention, </span>as <span class="greekheb">μνεια </span>equally signifies; <span class="ital">of you </span>— Whether before the throne of grace, or when conversing with my fellow-Christians. The clause may also be rendered, <span class="ital">I thank my God for all your kind remembrance of me, </span>namely, (as he partly at least means,) with respect to the supplies they had sent him. <span class="ital">Always in every prayer of mine </span>— He never failed, it seems, to pray for the churches when he prayed for himself; <span class="ital">making request </span>— That God would bestow on you an increase of every spiritual blessing; <span class="ital">with joy </span>— Joy peculiarly enlivens prayer. As <span class="ital">love </span>reigns in the epistle to the Ephesians, so does <span class="ital">joy </span>reign in this; the sum of the whole epistle being, <span class="ital">I rejoice; rejoice ye. For your fellowship in the gospel </span>— That you have united with us in embracing the gospel, and are joint partakers with us of its blessings; and so have fellowship also with all true Christians; <span class="ital">from the first day </span>— Of my preaching it among you; though soon attended with violent persecution, even with the scourging and imprisonment of myself and my fellow- labourer; and that you have persevered in the profession thereof from the time that you first embraced it. Or, the meaning may be, I thank God for your having received the gospel, from the first day of your receiving it until now. <span class="ital">Being confident </span>(and the grounds of his confidence are mentioned in the following verse) <span class="ital">that he who hath begun a good work in you </span>— Who hath not only done a good work for you, in justifying you, and giving you peace with himself through our Lord Jesus Christ, (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>,) but has wrought a <span class="ital">good work in you; </span>in your minds and hearts, by enlightening and quickening, regenerating and renewing you after his image, <a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a> : or, in beginning to sanctify you; <span class="ital">will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ </span>— Will carry it on till it come to perfection, and, at the second coming of Christ, issue in glory. <span class="ital">Even as it is meet </span>— <span class="greekheb">Δικαιον</span>, <span class="ital">just, reasonable; for me to think this of you all </span>— To have this good opinion and confidence. Why? He does not say, because of an eternal decree, or because the saints must of necessity persevere; but, <span class="ital">because I have you in my heart </span>— I affectionately remember you; <span class="ital">inasmuch as both in my bonds</span> — In this my imprisonment; <span class="ital">and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel </span>— In what I do and suffer for its defence and confirmation; <span class="ital">ye all are partakers of my grace </span>— That is, you have manifested that you possess the same grace that I myself have, in that you have done and suffered the same things which I have done and suffered. Or, as the clause may mean, because you are sharers in the afflictions which God hath vouch-safed me as a grace or favour. In other words, It is just or reasonable for me to think this concerning you all, (namely, that you will continue in the grace of God,) because you have been and are joint partakers with me, both of grace and of the sufferings by which grace is tried and manifested: or, The sufferings you have endured, and the things you have done, have manifested both the reality and the greatness of your grace; and therefore I cannot doubt of your perseverance. <span class="ital">For God </span>— To whom I appeal for the truth of what I say; <span class="ital">is my record </span>— Bears me witness; <span class="ital">how greatly I long after you all </span>— How vehemently I love you, or long after your prosperity, in spiritual things; <span class="ital">in the bowels of Jesus Christ</span> — With such a sincere, fervent, and spiritual love as has been wrought in me by Christ, and resembles that love which he bears to his members. In Paul, not Paul lives, but Jesus Christ; therefore he longs for them with the bowels, the tenderness, not of Paul, but of Jesus Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The highest honour of the most eminent ministers is, to be servants of Christ. And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you - Margin, "mention." The Greek word means, "recollection, remembrance." But this recollection may have been suggested either by his own reflections on what he had seen, or by what he had heard of them by others, or by the favors which they conferred on him reminding him of them. The meaning is, that as often as he thought on them, from whatever cause, he had occasion of thankfulness. He says that he thanked his God, intimating that the conduct of the Philippians was a proof of the favor of God to him; that is, he regarded their piety as one of the tokens of the favor of God to his own soul - for in producing that piety he had been mainly instrumental. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

After the inscription and salutation follows a thanksgiving, the object of which is God; to whom thanks is to be given at the remembrance of his name, and the perfections of his nature, and for all his mercies, temporal and spiritual. The apostle expresses his propriety and interest in him, calling him "my God"; thereby distinguishing him from all others, the nominal and fictitious gods of the Gentiles, and the idols and lusts of men's hearts; he was the God whom he served in the Gospel, by whom he was sent, and from whom he received all his possessions, and to whom he was accountable. He had a special, particular, covenant interest in him, had knowledge of it, and faith in it; and therefore could draw nigh to God with freedom, use confidence, plead promises, expect favours, and do all he did, whether in a way of prayer, or praise in faith, and therefore was acceptable unto God. This work of thanksgiving he was often employed in on account of these Philippians, even, says he, <p>upon every remembrance of you; that is, as often as I remember you, or make mention of you to God at the throne of grace, it being a customary thing with the apostle to mention by name the several churches, the care of which was upon him, in his prayers to God; see <a href="/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; and so he used to mention this church; and whenever he did, it was with thankfulness. The Arabic version reads it, "for", or "concerning all your remembrance"; meaning of himself, and as if the sense was, that he gave thanks to God for their remembrance of him at all times, and particularly at that time, by sending him relief in his present circumstances. But the former sense is preferable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Php 1:3</a> f.

If we should, with Castalio, Beza, and many others, including Weiss, connect as follows: “<span class="ital">whilst I at all times in all my praying for you all make the prayer with joy,</span>” the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ δεήσει τὴν δέησιν ποιούμενος</span>, as thus linked together, would be only a burdensome tautology. Instead of <span class="greekheb">μετὰ χαρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ποιούμ</span>., Paul would have simply and naturally written the mere <span class="greekheb">χαίρων</span>. This applies also to the view of Huther, who (in the <span class="ital">Mecklenb. Zeitschr</span>. 1863, p. 400) substantially agrees with Weiss. Hoelemann incorrectly connects <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ παντ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστῶ</span> (<a href="/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-16.htm" title="Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;">Ephesians 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>).
