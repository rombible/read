The exact translation is, <span class= "ital">But if to live in the flesh this is to me a fruit of work, and what</span> (or, <span class= "ital">what also</span>)<span class= "ital"> I shall choose I know not.</span> The construction is clearly broken by emotion or absorption in thought; it can only be supplied by conjecture. If (as in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?">2Corinthians 2:2</a>) the word “and,” or “also,” can be used to introduce the principal clause (“what then I shall choose,” &c.), the construction will be correct, though harsh. If otherwise, we must suppose either that the sentence is broken at the word “work,” or that the whole should run, <span class= "ital">But what if to live in the flesh is a part of work? And what I shall choose, I know not, </span>&c. But though the construction is obscure, the sense is plain. St. Paul had said, “to die is gain.” But the thought crosses him that to live still in the flesh, this and this only is (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>carries with it) a fruit of apostolical labour, in souls brought to Christ or built up in Him. Accordingly what to choose he knows not. For in such a harvest there is a gain, which outweighs his own personal gain on the other side.<p><span class= "bld">I am in a strait betwixt</span> (<span class= "ital">the</span>)<span class= "bld"> two.</span>—The word here used signifies “to be hemmed in,” or “confined,” and is generally associated with some idea of distress (as in <a href="/luke/8-45.htm" title="And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng you and press you, and say you, Who touched me?">Luke 8:45</a>; <a href="/luke/19-43.htm" title="For the days shall come on you, that your enemies shall cast a trench about you, and compass you round, and keep you in on every side,">Luke 19:43</a>), not unfrequently with the pressure of disease (<a href="/matthew/4-24.htm" title="And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.">Matthew 4:24</a>; <a href="/luke/4-38.htm" title="And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.

It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if I live in the flesh - If I continue to live; if I am not condemned and make a martyr at my approaching trial.<p>This is the fruit of my labour - The meaning of this passage, which has given much perplexity to commentators, it seems to me is, "If I live in the flesh, it will cost me labor; it will be attended, as it has been, with much effort and anxious care, and I know not which to prefer - whether to remain on the earth with these cares and the hope of doing good, or to go at once to a world of rest." A more literal version of the Greek will show that this is the meaning. &#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  Touto moi karpos ergou - "this to me is (or would be) the fruit of labor." Coverdale, however, renders it: "Inasmuch as to live in the flesh is fruitful to me for the work, I wot not what I shall choose." So Luther: "But since to live in the flesh serves to produce more fruit." And so Bloomfield: "But if my life in the flesh be of use to the gospel (be it so, I say no more), verily what I shall choose I see and know not."<p>See also Koppe, Rosenmuller, and Calvin, who give the same sense. According to this, the meaning is, that if his life were of value to the gospel, he was willing to live; or that it was a valuable object - operae pretium - worth an effort thus to live. This sense accords well with the connection, and the thought is a valuable one, but it is somewhat doubtful whether it can be made out from the Greek. To do it, it is necessary to suppose that &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  moi - "my" - is expletive (Koppe, and that &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  kai - "and" - is used in an unusual sense. See Erasmus. According to the interpretation first suggested, it means, that Paul felt that it would be gain to die, and that he was entirely willing; that he felt that if he continued to live it would involve toil and fatigue, and that, therefore, great as was the natural love of life, and desirous as he was to do good, he did not know which to choose - an immediate departure to the world of rest, or a prolonged life of toil and pain, attended even with the hope that he might do good. There was an intense desire to be with Christ, joined with the belief that his life here must be attended with toil and anxiety; and on the other hand an earnest wish to live in order to do good, and he knew not which to prefer.<p>Yet - The sense has been obscured by this translation. The Greek word (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  kai) means "and," and should have been so rendered here, in its usual sense. "To die would be gain; my life here would be one of toil, and I know not which to choose."<p>What I shall choose I wot not - I do not know which I should prefer, if it were left to me. On each side there were important considerations, and he knew not which overbalanced the other. Are not Christians often in this state, that if it were left to themselves they would not know which to choose, whether to live or to die? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. Rather as Greek, "But if to live in the flesh (if), this (I say, the continuance in life which I am undervaluing) be the fruit of my labor (that is, be the condition in which the fruit of my ministerial labor is involved), then what I shall choose I know not (I cannot determine with myself, if the choice were given me, both alternatives being great goods alike)." So Alford and Ellicott. Bengel takes it as English Version, which the Greek will bear by supposing an ellipsis, "If to live in the flesh (be my portion), this (continuing to live) is the fruit of my labor," that is, this continuance in life will be the occasion of my bringing in "the fruit of labor," that is, will be the occasion of "labors" which are their own "fruit" or reward; or, this my continuing "to live" will have this "fruit," namely, "labors" for Christ. Grotius explains "the fruit of labor" as an idiom for "worthwhile"; If I live in the flesh, this is worth my while, for thus Christ's interest will be advanced, "For to me to live is Christ" (Php 1:21; compare Php 2:30; Ro 1:13). The second alternative, namely, dying, is taken up and handled, Php 2:17, "If I be offered."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour:</span> some, from the various use of the Greek particles, render this first clanse interrogatively; But whether to live in the flesh were worth the while? Or more profitable? (understand, than to die). The apostle having intimated the equality and indifferency of his mind in an entire submission to the will of God, whether that glorifying of Christ by his life or that by his death were more eligible, is upon deliberation, finding the advantage to Christ and himself, upon expense of circumstances either way, in an equal balance, weighing one thing with another: living in the flesh, i.e. abiding here in this mortal body, which he thus expresseth by way of diminution, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a> <a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm" title="For as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;">1 Peter 4:1</a></span>; in opposition to, and comparison of, dying for and in the Lord, and so being with him, <span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Philippians 1:23</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet what I shall choose I wot not; </span> he seems, loving the Philippians as himself, to be at a loss what to determine, if God should permit him his choice, whether by labouring in his ministry for rite good of their souls he should bring more fruit to Christ, or by suffering, that which would arise from the blood of a martyr, who himself should receive a crown, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2 Timothy 4:8</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/philippians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if I live in the flesh,.... To be in the flesh sometimes signifies to be in a state of nature and unregeneracy, and to live in and after the flesh, to live according to the dictates of corrupt nature; but here it signifies living in the body, or the life which is in the flesh, as the Syriac version renders the phrase here, and as the apostle expresses it in <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, and the sense is, if I should live any longer in the body, and be continued for some time in this world: <p>this is the fruit of my labour; or "I have fruit in my works", as the above version renders it: <p>yet what I shall choose I wot not, or "know not"; whether life or death; since my life will be for the honour and glory of Christ, and though a toilsome and laborious one, yet useful and fruitful: by his "labour", he means his ministerial work and service; the ministry is a work, a good and honourable work, and a laborious one. Christ's faithful ministers are labourers; they labour in the word and doctrine, both in studying and preaching it; and such a labourer was the apostle, who by the grace of God laboured more abundantly than others; the "fruit" of which was the conversion of many sinners, the edification, comfort, and establishment of the saints, their fruitfulness in grace and works, the spread of the Gospel far and near, the enlargement of the kingdom of Christ, and the weakening of Satan's kingdom, and the glorifying of Christ in his person, offices, and great salvation; all which was a strong and swaying argument with him, to desire to live longer in the body, and made it on the one hand so difficult with him what to choose: for as a certain Jew (b) says, <p>"the righteous man desires to live to do the will of God while he lives; <p>but not with that view, he adds, <p>"to increase the reward of the soul in the world to come. <p>(b) Kimchi in Psal. vi. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> But if I live in the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> flesh, this <i>is</i> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</span><p>(7) An example of a true shepherd, who considers more how he may profit his sheep, than he considers any benefit of his own whatsoever.<p>(n) To live in this mortal body.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] <span class="ital">carrying onward</span> the discourse to the <span class="ital">comparison</span> between the two cases as regards their desirability.

Paul refrains from making and declaring such a choice, because (see <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Php 1:23</a> f.) his desire is so situated between the two alternatives, that it <span class="ital">clashes</span> with that which he is compelled to regard as the better.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The conformity to words and context, and the simplicity, which characterize the whole of this explanation (so, in substance, also Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, and many others, including Heinrichs, Rheinwald, van Hengel, de Wette, Wiesinger, Ewald, Ellicott, Hilgenfeld),—in which, however, <span class="greekheb">καρπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργου</span> is not to be taken as <span class="ital">operae pretium</span> (Calvin, Grotius, and others), nor <span class="greekheb">καί</span> as superfluous (Casaubon, Heinrichs, and others), nor <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΓΝΩΡΊΖΩ</span></span></span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ΟἾΔΑ</span></span></span> (see above),—exclude decisively all other interpretations, in which <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦΤΟ</span></span></span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> of the apodosis have been the special stumbling blocks. Among these other explanations are (<span class="ital">a</span>) that of Pelagius, Estius, Bengel, Matthies, and others (comp. Lachmann, who places a stop after <span class="greekheb">ἔργου</span>), that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΤΊ</span></span></span> is to be understood with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΣΑΡΚΊ</span></span></span>, that the apodosis begins with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦΤΟ</span></span></span>, and that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΤΊ ΑἹΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is a proposition by itself: “<span class="ital">if the living in the flesh is appointed to me, then this has no other aim for me than by continuous labour to bring forth fruit,</span>” etc. (Huther, <span class="ital">l.c</span>. p. 581 f.). But how arbitrarily is the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>, thus supplied, interpreted (<span class="ital">mihi constitutum est</span>)! The words <span class="greekheb">τοῦτό μοι καρπὸς ἔργου</span>, taken as an apodosis, are—immediately after the statement <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΜΟῚ ΓᾺΡ ΤῸ ΖῆΝ ΧΡΙΣΤΌς</span></span></span>, in which the idea of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΡΠῸς ἜΡΓΟΥ</span></span></span> is substantially conveyed already—adapted less for a new emphatic inference than for a supposition that has been established; and the discourse loses both in flow and force. Nevertheless Hofmann has in substance followed this explanation.[74] (<span class="ital">b</span>) Beza’s view, that <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> is to be taken as <span class="ital">whether:</span> “<span class="ital">an vero vivere in carne mihi operae pretium sit, et quid eligam ignoro</span>.” This is linguistically incorrect (<span class="greekheb">καρπὸς ἔργου</span>), awkward (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΤΊ</span></span></span>), and in the first member of the sentence un-Pauline (<a href="/context/philippians/1-24.htm" title="Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you....">Php 1:24-26</a>). (<span class="ital">c</span>) The assumption of an <span class="ital">aposiopesis</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἔργου</span>: if life, etc., is to me <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΡΠῸς ἜΡΓΟΥ</span></span></span>, “<span class="ital">non repugno, non aegre fero</span>” (so Corn. Müller), or, “<span class="ital">je ne dois pas désirer la mort</span>” (Rilliet). See Winer, p. 557 f. [E. T. 751]; Meineke, <span class="ital">Menand</span>. p. 238. This is quite arbitrary, and finds no support in the emotional character of the passage, which is in fact very calm. (<span class="ital">d</span>) Hoelemann’s explanation—which supplies <span class="greekheb">καρπός</span> from the sequel after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῆΝ</span></span></span>, takes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦΤΟ</span></span></span>, which applies to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΘΑΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, as the beginning of the apodosis, and understands <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΡΠῸς ἜΡΓΟΥ</span></span></span> as an <span class="ital">actual</span> fruit: “<span class="ital">but if life is a fruit in the flesh (an earthly fruit), this (death) is also a fruit of (in) fact (a substantial, real fruit)</span>”—is involved, artificial, and contrary to the genius of the language (<span class="greekheb">καρπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργου</span>!). (<span class="ital">e</span>) The explanation of Weiss is that, after <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>, <span class="greekheb">κέρδος</span> is to be again supplied as a predicate, so that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦΤΟ</span></span></span>, which is made to apply to the entire protasis, begins the apodosis: “but if life is a gain, that is a fruit of his labour, because the successes of his apostolic ministry can alone make his life worth having to him” (<a href="/philippians/1-24.htm" title="Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.">Php 1:24</a>). This supplying of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΈΡΔΟς</span></span></span>, which was predicated of the antithesis of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῆΝ</span></span></span>, is as arbitrary as it is intolerably forced; and, indeed, according to <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Php 1:21</a>, not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΈΡΔΟς</span></span></span> merely would have to be supplied, but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΜΟῚ ΚΈΡΔΟς</span></span></span>; and, since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΈΡΔΟς</span></span></span> is not to be taken from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΘΑΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, of which it is predicate, we should have to expect an <span class="ital">also</span> before <span class="greekheb">τὸ ζῆν</span>, so that Paul would have written: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΔῈ</span></span></span> (or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ ΕἸ</span></span></span>) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΤῸ ΖῆΝ ἘΝ ΣΑΡΚῚ ἘΜΟῚ ΚΈΡΔΟς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] <span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>Not as if Paul intended to say that <span class="ital">“he kept it to himself</span>,” a sense which Hofmann wrongly ascribes to this declaration. He intends to say rather that he <span class="ital">refrains from a decision regarding</span> what he should choose. The dilemma in which he found himself (comp. ver. 23) caused him <span class="ital">to waive the giving of such a decision</span>, in order not to <span class="ital">anticipate</span> in any way the divine purpose <span class="ital">by his own choice</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] <span class="ital">If it be life in the flesh</span>, namely, which I have to expect instead of dying (?), <span class="ital">then this</span>, namely the life in the flesh, <span class="ital">is to me produce of labour</span>, in so far as by living I produce fruit, <span class="ital">and thus then</span> (<span class="greekheb">καί</span>) <span class="ital">it is to me unknown</span>, etc. This interpretation of Hofmann’s also is liable to the objection that, if Paul intended to say that he produced fruit by his life, logically he must have predicated of his <span class="greekheb">ζῆν ἐν σαρκί</span>, not that it was to him <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς ἔργου</span>, but rather that it was <span class="greekheb">ἔργον καρποῦ</span>, a work (a working) which produces fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>. To show the diversities of interpretation to which this verse has given rise, it is enough to note that in the first clause Hpt[54] would supply <span class="greekheb">ζῇν ἐστιν</span>, while Ws[55] suggests <span class="greekheb">κέρδος</span>. Others regard the first two clauses as protasis (<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> summing up the words preceding), making the apodosis begin with <span class="greekheb">καί</span>. The context suggests an explanation more simple and more natural. Paul has sought to convince them that death has no terror for him; that, on the contrary, it is pure gain. Yet he will not have them suppose that therefore life on earth (<span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>, life with the encumbrance of sinful flesh) is a burden and a trouble. In the circumstances, as he points out immediately, it is probably best for him and them. And he will give a preliminary hint of this. Must we not supply <span class="greekheb">μοί ἐστι</span>, in thought, in the first clause? This is suggested both by <span class="greekheb">ἐμοί</span> preceding and by the <span class="greekheb">μοι</span> which follows. <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> has to be supplied, admittedly, in both clauses of <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Php 1:21</a>. There is no greater difficulty in doing so here. “But if life in the flesh be my portion, this means (so we must also translate the <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> supplied in first clause of <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Php 1:21</a>) for me fruit of (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, springing from) labour.” <span class="greekheb">τὸ ζῇν</span> is qualified by <span class="greekheb">ἐν σ</span>., because the Apostle felt that he could not regard physical death as quenching his life. Death only meant fuller life, therefore he must define when he wishes to speak of life on this earth.—<span class="greekheb">καρπὸς ἔργου</span>. For the phrase see Psalms 103. (104) 13, <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ καρποῦ τῶν ἔργων σου χορτασθήσεται ἡ γῆ</span>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/3-15.htm" title="For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.">Wis 3:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθῶν γὰρ πόνων ὁ καρπὸς εὐκλεής</span>. Aptly Thphyl., <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ ζῇν ἐν σαρκὶ οὐκ ἄκαρπόν μοί ἐστιν</span>· <span class="greekheb">καρποφορῶ γὰρ διδάσκων καὶ φωτίζων πάντας</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τί αἱρής</span>. <span class="greekheb">τί</span> has practically ousted <span class="greekheb">πότερον</span> from N.T. It is quite natural to have the fut. indicat. in a deliberative sentence.—<span class="greekheb">γνωρίζω</span>. Its invariable meaning in N.T. = “make known”. This sense suits almost every instance in LXX. So here, “I do not make known,” “I cannot tell”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[54] Haupt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] Weiss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/philippians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">But if I live in the flesh</span>, &c.] The Greek construction here is difficult by its brevity and abruptness. R.V. renders “<span class="ital">But if to live in this flesh—if this is the fruit of my work, then</span> &c.”; and, in the margin, “<span class="ital">But if to live in the flesh</span> be my lot, <span class="ital">this is the fruit of my work; and</span> &c.”; a rendering practically the same as A.V. This latter we much prefer, for grammatical reasons. It requires the mental insertion of “<span class="ital">be my lot</span>,” or the like; but this is quite easy, in a sentence where the words “<span class="ital">to live</span>” are obviously echoed from the words “<span class="ital">to live is Christ</span>” just above. As if to say, “But if this ‘living’ is still to be a ‘living <span class="ital">in the flesh</span>,’ this is fruit &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">this is the fruit of my labour</span>] Rather better, in view of the Greek idiom, <span class="bld">this I shall find fruit of work</span>. This “living in the flesh,” as it will be “Christ,” so will be “fruit,” result, of lifelong work. He means that work for Christ, the being employed by Christ, is for him the pulse of life on earth; <span class="ital">is</span> life for him, in a certain sense. And this he expresses with additional force by saying not merely “work” but “fruit of work.” For the work is of course fruitful: he who abides in Christ “beareth much <span class="ital">fruit</span>,” fruit that shall “remain” (<a href="/john/15-5.htm" title="I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.">John 15:5</a>; <a href="/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16</a>), whether or no he sees it. It is only the “works of darkness” that can be “unfruitful” (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm" title="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yet</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">and</span>.

Moreover, he uses <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span>, because, from the disjunction [two alternatives] laid down in the preceding verse, he now assumes the one; and on this assumption, presently, as if repenting, he begins to doubt, in such a way, however, as not to avoid assuming it in the meantime.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ζῇν</span>, viz. <span class="greekheb">ἐστί μοι</span>) <span class="ital">if living is to me:</span> if I am to live.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>) This is a limitation; for even they who die, live.—<span class="greekheb">καρπὸς ἔργου</span>, <span class="ital">the fruit of my labour</span>) I derive this fruit from it [from living], that I may thereby do the more <span class="ital">work;</span> a noble <span class="ital">work</span>, ch. <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Php 2:30</a>; desirable <span class="ital">fruit</span>, <a href="/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>. Another seeks fruit from [by means of] his labour; Paul regards the labour itself as the fruit. This living is the fruit of my labour. The expression, <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς ἔργου</span>, <span class="ital">the fruit of labour</span> [= the labour (is) my fruit]; as, <span class="ital">the river of the Rhine, the virtue of liberality</span> [for <span class="ital">the river Rhine; the virtue, liberality</span>]. The price of the labour is its immediate result.[11] Cicero says, “<span class="ital">I propose to myself as the fruit of friendship, friendship itself, than which nothing is more abundant</span>.”—<span class="greekheb">αἱρήσομαι</span>, <span class="ital">I shall choose</span>) He supposes the condition, viz. if the power of choosing were given to him. This is the reason of [the ground on which he uses] the Future. [<span class="ital">The lot of the Christian is truly an excellent one. It is only of things that are good that the choice can be made, so as to perplex or put his mind in a strait with hesitation. He never can be disappointed</span>.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">οὐ γνωρίζω</span>) <span class="ital">I do not explain</span>, viz. <span class="ital">to myself; i.e.</span> I do not determine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[11] The reward which the labour itself affords is an immediate result, independent of its future rewards.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I wot not</span>; or perhaps, as Meyer, "I make not known." St. Paul wavers between his own personal longing for rest in Paradise with Christ, and the thought that the continuance of his life on earth might conduce to the spreading of the gospel. The grammar of the Greek sentence aptly represents the apostle's hesitation. The  construction is almost hopelessly confused. Perhaps the interpretation of the R.V. is the simplest: "But if to live in the flesh, - if this is the fruit of my work, then what shall choose I wot not." Thus <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is parallel with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Ver. 21); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;</span> is also a gain, a fruit; the genitive is one of apposition; the work itself is the fruit. St. Paul, says Bengel, regards his work as fruit, others seek fruit from their work. Bishop Lightfoot proposes another rendering, "But what if my living in the flesh will bear fruit, etc.? In fact what to choose I know not." Surely, says Bengel, the Christian's lot is excellent; he can hesitate only in the choice of blessings; disappointed he cannot be. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If I live (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., better, if to live: the living, as <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21</a>.<p>This is the fruit of my labor<p>According to the A.V. these words form the offset of the conditional clause, and conclude the sentence: if I live - this is the fruit.
