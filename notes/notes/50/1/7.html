It is variously rendered; but it always refers, not to a single definite opinion, but to an habitual conviction or feeling.<p><span class= "bld">I have you in my heart.</span>—This (and not the marginal reading) is to be taken. The original is, grammatically speaking, ambiguous, but both the order and the context are decisive. Compare, for the sense, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2Corinthians 3:2</a>, “Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts.”<p><span class= "bld">Both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel.</span>—These words are certainly to be connected, as in our version. St. Paul unites his bonds with “the defence and confirmation of the gospel”—that is, with his pleading for it against objections, and establishment of it by positive teaching—on the ground stated in <a href="/context/philippians/1-12.htm" title="But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;">Philippians 1:12-13</a>, that these, his bonds, had tended “to the furtherance of the gospel.” He accepts the help sent him by the Philippians, in which they had (see <a href="/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Philippians 4:14</a>) “communicated” (in the original the word used is the same as here) “with his affliction,” as a means of fellowship with him in the whole of this work of evangelisation. It is true that in <a href="/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Philippians 1:30</a> he speaks of the Philippians as having themselves to undergo “the same conflict” as his own; but the expression “in my bonds, &c.,” can hardly be satisfied simply by this kind of fellowship.<p><span class= "bld">Ye all are partakers of my grace.</span>—Here, on the contrary, the marginal reading is preferable. Ye <span class= "ital">are all partakers with me of the grace</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of the privilege described in <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>. “Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.” See below, <a href="/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Philippians 1:29</a>; “To you it is given”—that is (in the original), “given as a grace”—not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The highest honour of the most eminent ministers is, to be servants of Christ. And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all - "There is a reason why I should cherish this hope of you, and this confident expectation that you will be saved. That reason is found in the evidence which you have given that you are sincere Christians. Having evidence of that, it is proper that I should believe that you will finally reach heaven."<p>Because I have you in my heart - Margin, "Ye have me in your." The Greek will bear either, though the former translation is the most obvious. The meaning is, that he was warmly attached to them, and had experienced many proofs of their kindness; and that there was, therefore, a propriety in his wishing for their salvation. Their conduct toward him, moreover, in his trials, had convinced him that they were actuated by Christian principle; and it was proper that he should believe that they would be kept to eternal life.<p>Both in my bonds - While I have been a prisoner - referring to the care which they had taken to minister to his needs; <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14</a>, <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>.<p>And in the defence - Greek: apology. He is probably referring to the time when he made his defense before Nero, and vindicated himself from the charges which had been brought against him; see the notes at <a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16</a>. Perhaps he means here, that on that occasion he was abandoned by those who should have stood by him, but that the Philippians showed him all the attention which they could. It is not impossible that they may have sent some of their number to sympathize with him in his trials, and to assure him of the unabated confidence of the church.<p>And confirmation of the gospel - In my efforts to defend the gospel, and to make it known; see <a href="/philippians/1-17.htm">Philippians 1:17</a>. The allusion is probably to the fact that, in all his efforts to defend the gospel, he had been sure of their sympathy and cooperation. Perhaps he refers to some assistance which he had derived from them in this cause, which is now to us unknown.<p>Ye all are partakers of my grace - Margin, "Or, with me of grace." The meaning is, that as they had participated with him in the defense of the gospel; as in all his troubles and persecutions they had made common cause with him, so it followed that they would partake of the same tokens of the divine favor. He expected that the divine blessing would follow his efforts in the cause of the gospel, and he says that they would share in the blessing. They had shown all the sympathy which they could in his trials; they had nobly stood by him when others forsook him; and he anticipated, as a matter of course, that they would all share in the benefits which would flow to him in his efforts in the cause of the Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. meet&#8212;Greek, "just."<p>to think this&#8212;to have the prayerful confidence I expressed (Php 1:4-6).<p>of you&#8212;literally, "in behalf of you." Paul's confident prayer in their behalf was that God would perfect His own good work of grace in them.<p>because, &c.&#8212;Punctuate and translate, "Because I have you in my heart (so Php 1:8; otherwise the Greek and the words immediately following in the verse, favor the Margin, 'Ye have me in your heart &#8230; being partakers of my grace') (both, in my bonds, and in my defense and confirmation of the Gospel), you (I say) all being fellow partakers of my grace." This last clause thus assigns the reason why he has them in his heart (that is, cherished in his love, 2Co 3:2; 7:3), even in his bonds, and in his defense and confirmation of the Gospel (such as he was constantly making in private, Ac 28:17-23; his self-defense and confirmation of the Gospel being necessarily conjoined, as the Greek implies; compare Php 1:17), namely, "inasmuch as ye are fellow partakers of my grace": inasmuch as ye share with me in "the fellowship of the Gospel" (Php 1:5), and have manifested this, both by suffering as I do for the Gospel's sake (Php 1:28-30), and by imparting to me of your substance (Php 4:15). It is natural and right for me thus confidently to pray in your behalf.

Now these Philippians were partakers with him of this, both in his "bonds", by sympathizing with him, praying for him, sending relief unto him, and by suffering such like things themselves; and "in the defence and confirmation of the Gospel", whether by suffering, preaching, or writing; they stood by him, encouraged and assisted him, when others forsook him, and laid difficulties and discouragements in his way; on account of all which it was but meet and proper he should entertain such sentiments of them as before expressed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> grace.</span><p>(e) A true proof of a true knitting together with Christ.<p>(f) He calls his bonds grace, as though he had received some singular benefit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>.

See already Chrysostom and Pelagius. These words, <span class="greekheb">ἔν τε τοῖς δεσμοῖς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., set forth the <span class="ital">faithful</span> and <span class="ital">abiding</span> love, which even his heavy misfortunes cannot change into concern for himself alone. They contain, however, the two points, co-ordinated by <span class="greekheb">τέ</span> … <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (<span class="ital">as well … as also</span>): (1) The <span class="ital">position</span> of the apostle, and (2) his <span class="ital">employment</span> in this position. The latter, which, through the non-repetition of the article before <span class="greekheb">βεβ</span>., is taken as a whole (Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gr</span>. p. 294 [E. T. 342]), is both <span class="ital">antithetical</span>, the <span class="ital">defence</span> of the gospel, and also <span class="ital">thetical</span>, the <span class="ital">confirmation</span> of it, that is, the corroboration of its truth by proof, testimony, etc., its <span class="ital">verification;</span> comp. <a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm" title="For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.">Hebrews 6:16</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm" title="Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="/mark/16-20.htm" title="And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following.

Hofmann, taking a groundless objection to our explanation from the use of <span class="greekheb">τέ</span> … <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (see, however, Baeumlein, <span class="ital">Partik</span>. p. 225), refuses to connect the <span class="greekheb">τέ</span> with the following <span class="greekheb">καί</span>; he prefers to connect with the one <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν</span>, namely with the <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ</span>, another, namely an <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν συγκοινωνούς</span>. This is an artificial conjunction of very different references of the <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν</span>, yielding the illogical formalism: I have you (1) <span class="ital">in my heart</span>, and (2) <span class="ital">for my companions</span>, etc. The latter would indeed be only a more precise qualitative definition of the former. The question, moreover, whether in <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀπολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βεβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγ</span>. Paul intended to speak of his <span class="ital">judicial</span> examination (Heinrichs, van Hengel), or of his <span class="ital">extra-judicial</span> action and ministry during his captivity, cannot be answered without arbitrariness, except by allowing that <span class="ital">both</span> were meant. For the words do not justify us in excluding the judicial defence (Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol. d. apostol. Zeitalt</span>. p. 430), since the <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογία</span> might be addressed not merely to Jews and Judaists, but also to Gentile judges.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγ</span>.] belongs to <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀπολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βεβαιώσει</span>, and <span class="ital">not</span> to <span class="greekheb">βεβ</span>. only; the latter view would make <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀπολ</span>. denote the <span class="ital">personal</span> vindication (Chrysostom, Estius, and others), but is decisively opposed by the non-repetition—closely coupling the two words—of the article before <span class="greekheb">βεβ</span>. But to interpret <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογία</span> and <span class="greekheb">βεβαίωσις</span> as <span class="ital">synonymous</span> (Rheinwald), or to assume an <span class="greekheb">ἓν διὰ δυοῖν</span> for <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογίᾳ εἰς βεβαίωσιν</span> (Heinrichs), is logically incorrect, and without warrant in the connection. It is also contrary to the context (on account of <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀπολογίᾳ</span>) to understand the <span class="greekheb">βεβαίωσις τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγ</span>. as the <span class="ital">actual</span> confirmation afforded by the apostle’s <span class="ital">sufferings</span> (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Erasmus, and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνούς μου κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] characterizes the <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, and supplies a motive for the <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν με ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμᾶς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="ital">since you</span>, etc. This love to you, unalterable even in my affliction, is based on the real <span class="ital">sympathy</span>, which results from <span class="ital">all of you being joint-partakers</span> with me in the grace. The emphasis is laid, primarily on <span class="greekheb">συγκ</span>. and then on <span class="greekheb">πάντας</span>, which is correlative with the previous <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>. The idea of the <span class="ital">grace which the apostle had received</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῆς χάριτος</span>) is defined solely from the connection, and that indeed by the two points immediately preceding, <span class="greekheb">ἔν τε τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου</span> and <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀπολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βεβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγ</span>., namely, as God’s gift of grace enabling them to <span class="ital">suffer</span> for the gospel (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Php 1:29</a> f.; see also <a href="/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1 Peter 2:19</a>), and therewith to <span class="ital">defend</span> and <span class="ital">confirm</span> instead of falling away from and denying it. “Magnus in hac re honos, magna praemia” (Grotius). Paul knew that the experience of this grace—for the setting forth of which the context itself amply suffices, without the need of any retrospective <span class="greekheb">ταύτης</span> (as is Hofmann’s objection)—had been vouchsafed not only to himself, but also to all his Philippian converts, who like him had had to suffer for Christ (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Php 1:29</a> f.); and thus, in his bonds, and whilst vindicating and confirming the gospel, conscious of the holy similarity in this respect between his and their experience, sympathetically and lovingly he bore them, as his <span class="ital">fellow-sharers</span> of this grace, in his heart. He knew that, whilst he was suffering, and defending and confirming the gospel, he had all his readers as <span class="greekheb">συμπάσχοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">συναπολογούμενοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">συμβεβαιοῦντες τὸ εὐαγγέλιον</span>, and that in virtue of the above-named grace of God, as a manifestation of which he had recognised his bonds, and his activity for the gospel in these bonds. Others interpret it much too generally and vaguely, looking at the tender and <span class="ital">special</span> references of the context, as the “gratiosa <span class="ital">evangelii</span> donatio” (Hoelemann, comp. Wolf, Heinrichs, de Wette, and others). Likewise without any more immediate reference to the context, and inappropriate, is its explanation of the <span class="ital">apostolic office</span> (<a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>, <span class="ital">et al.</span>), the Philippians being said to be active promoters of this through their faith (see Theodore of Mopsuestia); along with which a reference is introduced to the <span class="ital">assistance</span> rendered (Storr, am Ende, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Hofmann; comp. also Weiss)—which assistance has come to be regarded as a <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον</span> (but see on <a href="/philippians/1-5.htm" title="For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;">Php 1:5</a>), as Hofmann expresses it. Those who feel dissatisfied that Paul does not mention at the very beginning of the epistle the assistance rendered to him, prescribe a certain line for the apostle; which, however, he does not follow, but gives expression first of all to his love for the Philippians in subjects of a higher and more general interest, and puts off his expression of thanks, properly so called, to the end of the epistle. Lastly, the translation <span class="ital">gaudii</span> (Vulgate, Itala, Ambrosiaster, Pelagius, Primasius, Sedulius) is derived from another reading (<span class="greekheb">χαρᾶς</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">σύν</span> in <span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνούς</span> refers to <span class="greekheb">μου</span>, <span class="ital">my joint-partakers</span> (<a href="/philippians/4-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.">Php 4:14</a>) <span class="ital">of the grace</span>, thus combining <span class="greekheb">συγκ</span>. with a double genitive of the person and the thing, of the subject and the object (Kühner, II. 1, p. 288; Winer, p. 180 [E. T. 239]), and placing it first with emphasis; for this <span class="ital">joint fellowship</span> is the <span class="ital">point</span> of the love in question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the repetition of <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, see Matthiae, p. 1031, and on <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>; comp.

Still the former, as of a less periodic character, is more in harmony with the fervent tone of feeling. Besides, the repetition of <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> betrays a break in the flow of thought after <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span>. = our “right” or “natural”.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο φρονεῖν ὑπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>.

His love is expressed in the next verse.—Evidently <span class="greekheb">ἔν τε τοῖς δεσμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. goes with the following clause, for it is much more natural to suppose a break at the first <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, which is resumed by the second. On <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> before <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπολ</span>. see crit. note. Paul separates here (so also Wohl[52]) between his <span class="greekheb">δεσμοί</span> and his <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογία</span>, which makes up one idea with <span class="greekheb">βεβαίωσις</span>. It seems to us clear that this <span class="greekheb">ἀπολ</span>. marks a crisis in his circumstances of which the influence is seen all through the Epistle; <span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, <a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;">Php 1:25</a>, chap. <a href="/context/philippians/2-23.htm" title="Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me....">Php 2:23-24</a>. Ought it not to be taken in its ordinary judicial sense of a defence against a regular charge? (as against Lft[53] and Moule, CT[54], who refer <span class="greekheb">ἀπ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">βεβ</span>. to Paul’s missionary work at Rome, and Hpt[55], who thinks of Paul’s whole activity in refuting opponents, both public and private). The correctness of this view receives strong confirmation from Dsm[56] (<span class="ital">BS</span>[57], p. 100 ff.), who shows that Paul, like the Translators of the LXX, was well acquainted with the technical sense of <span class="greekheb">βεβαίωσις</span> (Lat. <span class="ital">evictio</span>), the obligation under which the seller came to the buyer to guarantee against all claims his right to what he had bought. So Paul’s defence before the emperor is a guarantee of the Gospel, a warrant of its value and claims. For <span class="greekheb">ἀπολ</span>. see <a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.">2 Timothy 4:16</a>. “My defence and confirmation of the Gospel.”—<span class="greekheb">συνκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> here must be the great central gift of God’s grace, which Paul always keeps in the foreground. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">χάριτι δὲ Θεοῦ εἰμὶ ὅ εἰμι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡ χάρις αὐτοῦ ἡ εἰς ἐμὲ οὐ κενὴ ἐγενήθη</span>.

Here again the grammar leaves two explanations open. Grammatically, the Apostle may say <span class="ital">either</span> that he has them in his heart both in his bonds and in his advocacy of the Gospel; <span class="ital">or</span> that in both these experiences they are partners of his grace. But the latter is the far more probable. There is something artificial in the statement that he carried them in his heart <span class="ital">both</span> in his imprisonment <span class="ital">and</span> in his work; for to him the two experiences would run up into one. But it would be natural for the Philippians (see next note but one) to isolate the two experiences of the Apostle in thought and sympathy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the defence and confirmation</span>] The two words are linked, in the Greek, into one idea. <span class="ital">“Defence”:</span>—Greek, <span class="ital">apologia</span>. For the word, see <a href="/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.">Acts 20:1</a>; <a href="/acts/25-16.htm" title="To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.">Acts 25:16</a>; below, 16; and esp. <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1 Peter 3:15</a>. Unlike our word “apology,” in its every-day use, it means the statement of a good case against an accuser. <a href="/context/acts/28-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said to them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans....">Acts 28:17-23</a> shews us St Paul “apologizing” in his Roman prison.—The early “Apologies” for Christianity, e.g. by Justin and Tertullian (cent. 2), are apologies in this sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye all are partakers of my grace</span>] This has been explained to mean that they too knew by experience the power of grace under imprisonment and in evangelistic work. But we have no reason to think that “all” (if indeed any) of the Philippian converts had been imprisoned at this date. The natural meaning is that their sympathy, and active assistance (<a href="/context/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity....">Php 4:10-19</a>), had so united them with both the bearing and doing of the Apostle that in this sense they were bound with him, and worked with him, and felt the power of God with him.—The word “grace” here (as in <a href="/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm" title="If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>) may refer to the <span class="ital">gracious gift</span> to him of apostolic work and trial, rather than to the internal Divine power for service. In this case, still more plainly, the Philippians were partners in “his grace.”—A closer rendering of the Greek is, <span class="bld">copartners of my grace as you all are.</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθὼς</span>, <span class="ital">even as</span>) He explains the reason why he speaks so kindly as to the Philippians.—<span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span>, <span class="ital">just</span>) I find just reasons in my own case, from the relationship of faith, and these reasons are not trifling.

Bonds do not restrain my love.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπολογίᾳ</span>, <span class="ital">in defence</span>) The Romans brought accusations against the Gospel.—<span class="greekheb">βεβαιώσει</span>, <span class="ital">in confirmation</span>) This is something more than <span class="ital">a defence</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</span>, <span class="ital">of the Gospel</span>) by which <span class="ital">grace</span> is announced.—<span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνοὺς</span>—<span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς ὄντας</span>) He said above, <span class="ital">you;</span> therefore here is the accusative for the genitive, as <a href="/acts/7-21.htm" title="And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.">Acts 7:21</a>, where see the note.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all</span>.

His love for them increases his confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel</span>. These words may be taken with the preceding, "I have you in my heart during my imprisonment and defense." So Chrysostom, whose words are very striking: <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. But it is, perhaps, more natural to take them with the following. <span class="cmt_word">Ye all are partakers of my grace</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye all are partakers with me of the grace.</span> They were partakers of the grace of God given to him in his bonds and in his work. The like grace was given to them both for the passive and active sides of the Christian life - both in endurance of suffering and in propagating the gospel. Thus there seems to be no reference in the words "defense and confirmation" to his public defense before Caesar (which probably had not yet taken place), but generally to his work of preaching the gospel, which was both apologetic, meeting the objections of adversaries, and aggressive, asserting the truth. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Even as (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2;)<p>The reason for being confident (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>Defense (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>.<p>Confirmation (&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here and <a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>.
