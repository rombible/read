There is a still fuller disclosure of a similar “spiritual experience” in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;">2Corinthians 4:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2Corinthians 5:15</a>. It is rare in the apostolic writings. St. Paul seems, in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.">2Corinthians 6:11</a>, almost to apologise for disclosing what is usually kept, in delicacy and reverence, for God alone.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">Shall turn to my salvation.</span>—Or, literally, <span class= "ital">shall issue in salvation to me.</span> The word “salvation” does not appear to be used here in its ordinary sense, that is, of primary or ultimate salvation from sin in Christ, but in the sense of “safety.” The enemies of the Apostle thought to stir up fresh danger and difficulty for St. Paul; but the attempt (he says) will only turn out to his safety—a safety which he believes (see <a href="/context/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;">Philippians 1:25-26</a>) will be shown “in life,” by his actual release and return to his beloved churches, but which, if God so wills it, will be at least equally manifested in the “death,” which would bring him safe home to Christ. In either case he will be safe from all the enmity both of open sin and of malignant jealousy.<p><span class= "bld">Through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit.</span>—This overruling of all enmity to his safety he hopes for through the intercession of the Philippian Church (comp. <a href="/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23</a>), and the fresh supply of grace which, through such intercession, may be given to him. For the word “supply” in this sense see <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>; and comp. <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The Spirit of Jesus Christ.</span>—Of the application of this name to the Holy Ghost we have instances in <a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

Of these the first is the most notable, since in two clauses of the same sentence we have first “the Spirit of God,” and then “the Spirit of Christ.” He who is “sent by the Father in the name of the Son” (<a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>), and whose regeneration of the soul is the working out the image of Christ in it, may well be called “the Spirit of Christ.” But the name has always some specialty of emphasis. Thus here, the whole conception of the passage is of Christ—“to me to live is Christ;” hence the use of this special and comparatively rare name of the Holy Ghost.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation - Will be a means of my salvation. Whether the effect shall be to turn public favor toward the Christian religion, and secure my release; or whether it shall be to instigate my enemies more, so as to lead to my death; I am satisfied that the result, so far as I am concerned, will be well. The word "salvation," here, does not refer to his release from captivity, as Koppe, Rosenmuller, Clarke, and others, suppose; for he was not absolutely certain of that, and could not expect that to be effected by "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" But the meaning is, that all these dealings, including his imprisonment, and especially the conduct of those who thought to add affliction to his bonds, would be among the means of his salvation. Trying and painful as all this was, yet trial and pain Paul reckoned among the means of grace; and he had no doubt that this would prove so.<p>Through your prayer - See the notes at <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>.<p>And the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ - To sustain me, and to cause those happy results to come out of these trials.

This proclamation of Christ every way will turn out to my spiritual good. Christ, whose interests are my interests, being glorified thereby; and so the coming of His kingdom being furthered, which, when it does come, will bring completed "SALVATION" (Heb 9:28) to me and all whose "earnest expectation" (Php 1:20) is that Christ may be magnified in them. So far is their preaching from causing me, as they thought, tribulation in my bonds (Php 1:16). Paul plainly quotes and applies to himself the very words of the Septuagint (Job 13:16), "This shall turn out to my salvation," which belong to all God's people of every age, in their tribulation (compare Job 13:15).<p>through your prayer and the supply&#8212;The Greek intimately joins the two nouns together, by having but one preposition and one article: "Through your prayer and (the consequent) supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (obtained for me through your prayer)."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He doth here further commend Timothy, compared with the generality of those who with him did attend the ministry of the gospel at Rome, where it seems (whatever the papists pretend) Peter did not then preside as metropolitan.

The apostle knew that the prayer of a righteous man availeth much with God, and is very prevalent with him, and much more the prayers of a whole church; wherefore he frequently desired them for him on many accounts; and among others, that he might be delivered out of the hands of unreasonable men; and he firmly believed that he should be delivered by such means: <p>and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; which he had reason to expect and hope would be given him through their prayers for him; for though God has made large provisions for the supply of the wants of his people, in his Son and in his covenant, to be dispensed unto them by his Spirit, yet for these will he be sought unto by them: the supply of the Spirit is a supply of gifts from Christ, fitting and qualifying men for his service, and which are ministered by the Spirit to them severally as he will; and a supply of grace out of the fulness of Christ, which the Spirit of grace is the applier of; and a supply of strength from the same by him, to enable the saints both to do and suffer whatever he is pleased to call, them to; it is in short a supply of all their need, which the Spirit of God helps them to, according to the riches of grace, in glory by Christ: this the apostle knew would be sufficient for him, to support him under his present troubles, to deliver him out of them, and to fit him for whatever future work and service his Lord and master had for him to do. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>.

The only apparent ground for reading <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is its difficulty. <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> (which has greatly preponderating authority) gives the reason for the continuance of his joy.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>. There is no need to limit this to his captivity (so Kl[48]), or his worries and trial (De W., Lft[49]). It is used generally of his present circumstances. <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> … <span class="greekheb">σωτ</span>. is quoted from <a href="/job/13-16.htm" title="He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.">Job 13:16</a> (LXX).—<span class="greekheb">σωτ</span>. We fail to see why this should be interpreted as the final eschatological salvation (so Ws[50], Lft[51], Kl[52], etc.). There is nothing in the context to justify such a thought. He has every reason to hope, he tells them, that he will see them again in peace (<a href="/context/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;...">Php 1:25-27</a>). Surely he is thinking chiefly of his probable release, an expectation which admirably accords with the favourable view of his case which was evidently being taken at Rome. This interpretation (Chr[53], <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀπαλλαγὴν λέγει</span>) is strongly supported by the sense of the word in <a href="/job/13-16.htm" title="He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.">Job 13:16</a>, from which it is here quoted, where <span class="greekheb">יְשׁוּעָה</span> has not the usual deeper meaning which belongs to it in the Prophh. and Pss., but signifies victory in a contest for the right. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also <a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;">2 Corinthians 1:10</a> ff., a passage precisely akin to this, which favours the above idea of <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>.

In any case (the thought crosses his mind that he may still be condemned) he hopes to glorify Christ whether in life or death.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορ</span>. The absence of the article is no reason for joining <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχ</span>. closely with <span class="greekheb">δεής</span>. under the government of <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>. The gen. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. is quite sufficient to isolate <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχ</span>. “The supply given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ.” This is the Spirit possessed by Christ Himself and communicated to all who abide in Him as members of His body. Of course Paul, at times, really identifies Christ with the Spirit, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>. This identification springs directly from his own spiritual history. “The first ‘pneumatic’ experience Paul had was an experience of Christ” (Gunkel, <span class="ital">Wirkungen d. heil. Geistes</span>2, p. 91). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> for the word <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορ</span>. <span class="ital">Ep. ad Diogn.</span>, i., 10, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ καὶ τὸ λέγειν καὶ τὸ ἀκούειν ἡμῖν χορηγοῦντος</span>. “A suitable and common word for the Giver God.… The generosity of its origin survives in the transfer” (Gildersleeve <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[48] Klöpper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[49] Lightfoot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[50] Weiss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[51] Lightfoot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[52] Klöpper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[53] Chrysostom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/philippians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">For I know</span>] A development of the thought implied in “I shall rejoice,” just above. Subordinate to the supreme fact that “Christ is being proclaimed,” comes in here the delightful certainty that the attendant discipline will further his own spiritual and eternal good, always in connexion with service rendered to his Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that this shall turn to my salvation</span>] Rather more closely, in view of the Greek idiom, <span class="bld">that I shall find this thing result in salvation</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Salvation</span>”:—here, probably, final glory. The word <span class="ital">sótêria</span> includes, in its widest reference, the whole process of saving mercy, from the gift of the Saviour to the ultimate bliss of the saved. More definitely, in the life of the Christian, it points sometimes to his first knowledge of and faith in the Saviour (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="(For he said, I have heard you in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored you: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>), sometimes to the lifelong process of his Divine preservation in Christ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1 Peter 1:9</a>), more frequently to the heavenly issue of the whole in glory (<a href="/romans/13-11.htm" title="And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.">Romans 13:11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a>). The same may be said of the cognate verb, only that it more often than the noun refers to the lifelong process.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In a few passages (e.g. <a href="/acts/27-34.htm" title="Why I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.">Acts 27:34</a>) the noun refers to bodily preservation. But this meaning is precluded here by the reference just below to the “supply of <span class="ital">the Spirit</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through your prayer</span>] He is sure of the coming blessing, and equally sure of the efficacy of the means to it—intercessory prayer. For St Paul’s high estimate of the worth of intercession for himself and his work cp. e.g. <a href="/romans/15-30.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;">Romans 15:30</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the supply</span>] The Greek word slightly indicates a supply which is large and free.—For the thought cp. <a href="/john/10-10.htm" title="The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.">John 10:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</span>] Here first, what is “<span class="ital">the Spirit of Jesus Christ</span>”? Certainly not merely “His principles and temper.” So vague a meaning of the word “Spirit” is foreign to the N. T. The analogy of e.g. <a href="/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1 Peter 1:11</a>; taken along with our Lord’s own teaching about the personal Paraclete who was to be His Divine Representative and Equivalent in the true Church (John 14-16), assures us that this is the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the blessed Trinity. He is “the Spirit of Jesus Christ” because in the eternal relations within Deity He “proceeds” from the Eternal Son, and is sent by Him (<a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>) as well as by the Father (<a href="/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>), and is so one with Christ that where the Spirit comes Christ comes (<a href="/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>). His whole work for and in the Church and the soul is essentially and entirely connected with the glorified Lord. He regenerates by effecting our vital union with Christ; He sanctifies and strengthens by maintaining and developing it. We possess the Spirit because of Christ; we possess Christ, in the sense of union, by the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Secondly, what is “<span class="ital">the supply</span> of the Spirit”? Grammatically, the phrase may mean either, “the supply which is the Spirit,” or, “the supply which the Spirit gives.” Happily the two practically converge. But we prefer the former, in view of <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>, where the verb “<span class="ital">ministereth</span>,” R.V. “<span class="ital">supplieth</span>,” is cognate to the noun “<span class="ital">supply</span>” here. The Apostle thus anticipates, in answer to the Philippians’ prayers, a new outpouring within him of the power of the blessed Paraclete, developing there the presence of Jesus Christ. Cp. his own prayer for other converts, <a href="/context/ephesians/3-14.htm" title="For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,...">Ephesians 3:14-19</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) [aetiologia].

The opposition of his enemies will stir him up to greater activity and earnestness, and so conduce to his spiritual well-being now and to his salvation hereafter. This he <span class="accented">knows</span>, for "all things work together for good to them that love God." Some, as Chrysostom, understand <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here of present safety or deliverance from prison; but this seems improbable.

As the prayer ascends, says Bengel, the supply of the Spirit descends; comp. <a href="/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5</a>, "He that ministereth ['supplieth,' R.V.] to you the Spirit." The Spirit is the supply; the Lord Jesus sends the quickening Spirit from the Father. Others, as Meyer, make the genitive subjective, and interpret "the aid which the Spirit supplies." The Spirit is here called "the Spirit of Jesus Christ" - "proceeding from the Father <span class="accented">and the Son."</span> So also <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>; <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a> (in the true reading), "the Spirit of Jesus." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>This<p>This preaching of Christ in every way.<p>Shall turn (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., come off, eventuate.<p>Salvation<p>Not his deliverance from captivity, but it will prove salutary to him in a spiritual sense and to the saving work of the Gospel.
