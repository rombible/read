As the apostle had found the benefit of their assistance, he knew how comfortable it would be to his fellow-labourers to have the help of others. Let us seek to give assurance that our names are written in the book of life. Joy in God is of great consequence in the Christian life; and Christians need to be again and again called to it. It more than outweighs all causes for sorrow. Let their enemies perceive how moderate they were as to outward things, and how composedly they suffered loss and hardships. The day of judgment will soon arrive, with full redemption to believers, and destruction to ungodly men. There is a care of diligence which is our duty, and agrees with a wise forecast and due concern; but there is a care of fear and distrust, which is sin and folly, and only perplexes and distracts the mind. As a remedy against perplexing care, constant prayer is recommended. Not only stated times for prayer, but in every thing by prayer. We must join thanksgivings with prayers and supplications; not only seek supplies of good, but own the mercies we have received. God needs not to be told our wants or desires; he knows them better than we do; but he will have us show that we value the mercy, and feel our dependence on him. The peace of God, the comfortable sense of being reconciled to God, and having a part in his favour, and the hope of the heavenly blessedness, are a greater good than can be fully expressed. This peace will keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus; it will keep us from sinning under troubles, and from sinking under them; keep us calm and with inward satisfaction. Believers are to get and to keep a good name; a name for good things with God and good men. We should walk in all the ways of virtue, and abide therein; then, whether our praise is of men or not, it will be of God. The apostle is for an example. His doctrine and life agreed together. The way to have the God of peace with us, is to keep close to our duty. All our privileges and salvation arise in the free mercy of God; yet the enjoyment of them depends on our sincere and holy conduct. These are works of God, pertaining to God, and to him only are they to be ascribed, and to no other, neither men, words, nor deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche - These are doubtless the names of females. The name Syntyche is sometimes the name of a man; but, if these persons are referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, there can be no doubt that they were females. Nothing more is known of them than is here mentioned.

This direct reference to a difference of opinion between two women of prominence in the Philippian Church is probably the best comment we have on the slight dissensions which are here and there hinted at throughout the Epistle. For, as Schinz aptly puts it (<span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, p. 37), “in such a pure Church, even slight bickerings would make a great impression”. We find no trace of the cause. It may have turned on the question discussed in chap. <a href="/context/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you....">Php 3:15-16</a>. It may have been accidental friction between two energetic Christian women. But from the whole tone of the Epistle it cannot have gone far. Six Christian bishops named <span class="greekheb">Εὐόδιος</span> are mentioned in the <span class="ital">Dict. of Christ. Biogr.</span> The feminine name is also found in Inscrr[15].—<span class="greekheb">Συντύχη</span>. The name occurs both in Greek and Latin Inscrr[16]., as well as in the <span class="ital">Acta Sanctorum</span> (v., 225). Curiously enough, there is no masculine name precisely corresponding to be found except the form <span class="ital">Sintichus</span> (<span class="ital">C.I.L.</span>, xii., no. 4703, from Narbo in Gaul. The Inscr. quoted by Lft[17]. is spurious). On the correct accentuation see the elaborate note in W-Sch[18]., p. 71. Lft[19]. has collected valuable evidence to show the superior position occupied by women in Macedonia. See his <span class="ital">Philippians</span>, p. 56, notes 2, 3, where he quotes Inscrr[20]., in some of which a metronymic takes the place of the patronymic, while others record monuments erected in honour of women by public bodies. We may add, from Heuzey, <span class="ital">Voyage Archéol.</span>, p. 423, an Inscr. of Larissa, where a woman’s name occurs among the winners in the horse-races (see <span class="ital">Introduction</span>). For the prominence of women generally in the Pauline Churches, <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Romans 16 <span class="ital">passim</span>, <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law....">1 Corinthians 14:34-35</a>.

But such a name is nowhere found in Greek inscriptions, nor is Euodias, though this might be contracted from the known name Euodianus. Both Euodia and Syntychê are known <span class="ital">feminine</span> names, and the persons here are evidently referred to as women, <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Php 4:3</a>.—Of these two Christians we know nothing but from this mention. They may have been “deaconesses,” like Phœbe (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>); they were certainly (see <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Php 4:3</a>) active helpers of the Missionary in his days of labour at Philippi. Perhaps their activity, and the reputation it won, had occasioned a temptation to self-esteem and mutual jealousy; a phenomenon unhappily not rare in the modern Church.—Bp Lightfoot (on this verse, and p. 55 of his edition) remarks on the prominence of women in the narrative of the evangelisation of Macedonia; <a href="/context/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither....">Acts 16:13-15</a>; <a href="/acts/16-40.htm" title="And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.">Acts 16:40</a>; <a href="/acts/17-4.htm" title="And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.">Acts 17:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-12.htm" title="Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.">Acts 17:12</a>. He gives proof that the social position and influence of Macedonian women was higher than in most ancient communities. See above, Introduction, p. 13. The mention here of two women as important persons in the Philippian Church is certainly an interesting coincidence with the Acts.—As a curiosity of interpretation, Ellicott (see also Lightfoot, p. 170) mentions the conjecture of Schwegler that Euodia and Syntyche are really designations of <span class="ital">Church-parties</span>, the names being devised and significant. This theory, of course, regards our Epistle as a fabrication of a later generation, intended as an <span class="ital">eirenicon</span>. “What will not men affirm?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the same mind in the Lord</span>] They must lay aside pique and prejudice, in the power and peace of their common union with Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Php 4:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παρακαλῶ</span>, <span class="ital">I</span> [<span class="ital">beseech</span>], <span class="ital">exhort</span>) He uses this word twice, as if exhorting each of them apart face to face, and doing it with the utmost <span class="ital">impartiality</span> [implied by repeating the like word to each separately].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beseech Enodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Euodia.</span> It is plain from the next verse that both are female names. The narrative in <a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16</a> shows that the female element was more than usually important in the early Philippian Church. These ladies seem to have held a high position in that Church; possibly they may have been deaconesses, like Phoebe at Cenchrea. Their dissensions disturbed the peace of the Church. The repeated "I beseech" is emphatic; it may, perhaps, also imply that both were in fault. St. Paul earnestly begs them to be reconciled, and to be reconciled as Christians, in the Lord, as members of his body, in the consciousness of his presence. Mark how often the words, "in Christ," "in the Lord," occur in this Epistle; how constantly the thought of spiritual union with Christ was present to the apostle's mind. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche (&#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;)<p>Euodias is incorrect, the name being feminine, Euodia.

These were prominent women in the Church, possibly deaconesses. The position of women in Macedonia was exceptional. In Greece, generally, their standing was inferior. The Athenian law prescribed that everything that a man might do by the consent or request of a woman should be null in law. In Macedonia monuments were erected to women by public bodies, and in Macedonian inscriptions records of male proper names are found formed on the mother's name instead of the father's. Macedonian women were permitted to hold property. In the account of Paul's labors in Macedonia there are notices of the addition of women of rank to the church in Thessalonica and Beroea.<p>For beseech, render exhort, and notice the repetition of that word with each name, making the exhortation individual and specific.<p>To be of the same mind (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The same expression as in <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>, see note. Compare <a href="/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>. The verb &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; to be minded, occurs eleven times in this epistle, and but seventeen times in the rest of the New Testament. </body></html>
