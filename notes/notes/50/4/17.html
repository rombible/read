There is, says St. Paul, “the fruit” of reward, which “is over” as a surplus, or rather a balance, “placed to their account.” Their gift is a token of love and gratitude to him; but, as Christian almsgiving, it is something more, and what that something more is will be seen hereafter, when all accounts shall be finally taken. The idea is not unlike that of <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm" title="He that has pity on the poor lends to the LORD; and that which he has given will he pay him again.">Proverbs 19:17</a>, “He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and behold, what he layeth out it shall be paid him again.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not because I desire a gift - "The reason why I rejoice in the reception of what you have sent to me, is not that I am covetous." From the interest with which he had spoken of their attention to him, some might perhaps be disposed to say, that it arose from this cause. He says, therefore, that, grateful as he was for the favor which he had received, his chief interest in it arose from the fact that it would contribute ultimately to their own good. It showed that they were governed by Christian principle, and this would not fall to be rewarded. What Paul states here is by no means impossible; though it may not be very common. In the reception of layouts from others, it is practicable to rejoice in them mainly, because their bestowment will be a means of good to the benefactor himself. All our selfish feelings and gratifications may be absorbed and lost in the superior joy which we have in seeing others actuated by a right spirit, and in the belief that they will be rewarded. This feeling is one of the fruits of Christian kindness. It is that which leads us to look away from self, and to rejoice in every evidence that others will be made happy.<p>I desire fruit - The word "fruit" is often used in the Scriptures, as elsewhere, to denote results, or that which is produced. Thus, we speak of punishment as the fruit of sin, poverty as the fruit of idleness, and happiness as the fruit of a virtuous life. The language is taken from the fact, that a man reaps or gathers the fruit or result of that which he plants.<p>To your account - A phrase taken from commercial dealings. The apostle wished that it might be set down to their credit. He desired that when they came to appear before God, they might reap the benefit of all the acts of kindness which they had shown him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. a gift&#8212;Greek, "the gift."

The imagery, by its very paradox, would be appropriate in this passage of <span class="ital">ingenious</span> kindness. The only objection to the rendering is that the precise Greek words are not actually found in special pecuniary connexions, though they would easily fit into them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">“That may”:</span>—<span class="bld">that does</span> is certainly right, and in point. He regards it as as a present certainty that “God is well pleased” (<a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm" title="But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.">Hebrews 13:16</a>) with their gift of love, and that the blessed “profit” of His “well done, good and faithful” (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:21</a>) is secure for them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/4-17.htm" title="Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.">Php 4:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐχʼ ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">not that</span>) He explains why he uses many words.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιζητῶ</span>, <span class="ital">I seek</span>) having welcomed your kindness.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς λόγον ὑμῶν</span>) [<span class="ital">to your account</span>] <span class="ital">in respect to you</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account</span>; rather, as R.V., not <span class="accented">that</span> I <span class="accented">seek for the gift</span>; <span class="accented">but I seek for the fruit that creaseth to your account.</span> He shrinks sensitively from the danger of being mistaken; his words are not to be understood as a hint for further gifts. It is not the gift that he desires; but there is something which he longs for, and that is, charity, the fruit of the Spirit, showing itself in the generosity of the Philippians - the fruit of good works, continually increasing, and set down in heaven to their account. </body></html>
