What follows is but postscript.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:2-9 Let believers be of one mind, and ready to help each other. As the apostle had found the benefit of their assistance, he knew how comfortable it would be to his fellow-labourers to have the help of others. Let us seek to give assurance that our names are written in the book of life. Joy in God is of great consequence in the Christian life; and Christians need to be again and again called to it. It more than outweighs all causes for sorrow. Let their enemies perceive how moderate they were as to outward things, and how composedly they suffered loss and hardships. The day of judgment will soon arrive, with full redemption to believers, and destruction to ungodly men. There is a care of diligence which is our duty, and agrees with a wise forecast and due concern; but there is a care of fear and distrust, which is sin and folly, and only perplexes and distracts the mind. As a remedy against perplexing care, constant prayer is recommended. Not only stated times for prayer, but in every thing by prayer. We must join thanksgivings with prayers and supplications; not only seek supplies of good, but own the mercies we have received. God needs not to be told our wants or desires; he knows them better than we do; but he will have us show that we value the mercy, and feel our dependence on him. The peace of God, the comfortable sense of being reconciled to God, and having a part in his favour, and the hope of the heavenly blessedness, are a greater good than can be fully expressed. This peace will keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus; it will keep us from sinning under troubles, and from sinking under them; keep us calm and with inward satisfaction. Believers are to get and to keep a good name; a name for good things with God and good men. We should walk in all the ways of virtue, and abide therein; then, whether our praise is of men or not, it will be of God. The apostle is for an example. His doctrine and life agreed together. The way to have the God of peace with us, is to keep close to our duty. All our privileges and salvation arise in the free mercy of God; yet the enjoyment of them depends on our sincere and holy conduct. These are works of God, pertaining to God, and to him only are they to be ascribed, and to no other, neither men, words, nor deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Those things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do - That is, what you have witnessed in me, and what you have learned of me, and what you have heard about me, practice yourselves. Paul refers them to his uniform conduct - to all that they had seen, and known, and heard of him, as that which it was proper for them to imitate. The same thing, substantially, he urges in <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>; see the notes at that verse. It could have been only the consciousness of a pure and upright life which would make such counsel proper. How few are the people at this day who can urge others to imitate all that they have seen in them, and learned from them, and heard of them.<p>And the God of peace shall be with you - The God who gives peace; compare <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; see also the notes at <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>. The meaning here is, that Paul, by pursuing the course of life which he had led, and which he here counsels them to follow, had found that it had been attended with the blessing of the God of peace, and he felt the fullest assurance that the same blessing would rest on them if they imitated his example. The way to obtain the blessing of the God of peace, is to lead a holy life, and to perform with faithfulness all the duties which we owe to God and to our fellow-men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. both&#8212;rather, "The things also which ye have learned &#8230; these practice"; the things which besides recommending them in words, have been also recommended by my example, carry into practice.<p>heard&#8212;though ye have not yet sufficiently "received" them.<p>seen&#8212;though ye have not as yet sufficiently "learned" them [Bengel].<p>and&#8212;"and then," as the necessary result (Php 4:7).

But the two are closely connected; the Divine peace in the individual tends always, in its right development and action, to the peace of the community, for it means the dethronement of the spirit of self. St Paul may thus have had in view here the need of more harmony among the Philippians, and of a nobler moral and spiritual tone (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Php 4:8</a>) as an aid towards it.
