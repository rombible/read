<a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.">2Timothy 4:16</a>. At Cæsarea St. Paul would have been necessarily cut off from the European churches; at Rome, the metropolis of universal concourse, he may have expected some earlier communication. But, fearing to wound the Philippians by even the semblance of reproof, in their case undeserved, he adds at once, “In which ye were also careful (before), but ye lacked opportunity.”. Epaphroditus would seem to have arrived early, almost as soon as St. Paul’s arrival at Rome gave them the opportunity which they previously lacked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">HOW TO SAY ‘THANK YOU’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity....">Php 4:10-14</a> {R.V.}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is very difficult to give money without hurting the recipient. It is as difficult to receive it without embarrassment and sense of inferiority. Paul here shows us how he could handle a delicate subject with a feminine fineness of instinct and a noble self-respect joined with warmest gratitude. He carries the weight of obligation, is profuse in his thanks, and yet never crosses the thin line which separates the expression of gratitude from self-abasing exaggeration, nor that other which distinguishes self-respect in the receiver of benefits from proud unwillingness to be obliged to anybody. Few words are more difficult to say rightly than ‘Thank you.’ Some people speak them reluctantly and some too fluently: some givers are too exacting in the acknowledgments they expect, and do not so much give as barter so much help for so much recognition of superiority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Philippians had sent to Paul some money help by Epaphroditus as we heard before in Chapter II., and this gift he now acknowledges in a paragraph full of autobiographical interest which may be taken as a very model of the money relations between teachers and taught in the church. It is besides an exquisite illustration of the fineness and delicacy of Paul’s nature, and it includes large spiritual lessons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The stream of the Apostle’s thoughts takes three turns here. There is first the exuberant and delicate expression of his thanks, then, as fearing that they might misunderstand his joy in their affection as if it were only selfish gladness that his wants had been met, he gives utterance to his triumphant and yet humble consciousness of his Christ-given independence in, and of, all circumstances, and then feeling in a moment that such words, if they stood alone, might sound ungrateful, he again returns to thanks, but not for their gift so much as for the sympathy expressed in it. We may follow these movements of feeling now.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The exuberant expression of thanks, ‘I rejoice in the Lord greatly.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is an instance of his following his own twice-given precept, ‘Rejoice in the Lord always.’ The Philippians’ care of him was the source of the joy, and yet it was joy in the Lord. So we learn the perfect consistency of that joy in Christ with the full enjoyment of all other sources of joy, and especially of the joy that arises from Christian love and friendship. Union with Christ heightens and purifies all earthly relations. Nobody should be so tender and so sweet in these as a Christian. His faith should be like the sunshine blazing out over the meadows making them greener. It should, and does in the measure of its power, destroy selfishness and guard us against the evils which sap love and the anxieties which torment it, against the dread that it may end, and our hopeless desolation when it does. There is a false ascetic idea of Christian devotion as if it were a regard to Christ which made our hearts cold to others, which is clean against Paul’s experience here. His joy went out in fuller stream towards the Philippians because it was ‘joy in the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may just note in passing the tender metaphor by which the Philippians’ renewed thought of him is likened to a tree’s putting forth its buds in a gracious springtide, and may link with it the pretty fancy of an old commentator whom some people call prosaic and puritanical {Bengel}, that the stormy winter had hindered communication, and that Epaphroditus and the gifts came with the opening spring.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul’s inborn delicacy and quick considerateness comes beautifully forward in his addition, to remove any suspicion of his thinking that his friends in Philippi had been negligent or cold. Therefore he adds that he knew that they had always had the will. What had hindered them we do not know. Perhaps they had no one to send. Perhaps they had not heard that such help would be welcome, but whatever frost had kept the tree from budding, he knew that the sap was in it all the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may note that trait of true friendship, confidence in a love that did not express itself. Many of us are too exacting in always wanting manifestations of our friend’s affection. What cries out for these is not love so much as self-importance which has not had the attention which it thinks its due. How often there have been breaches of intimacy which have no better reason than ‘He didn’t come to see me often enough’; ‘He hasn’t written to me for ever so long’; ‘He does not pay me the attention I expect.’ It is a poor love which is always needing to be assured of another’s. It is better to err in believing that there is a store of goodwill in our friends’ hearts to us which only needs occasion to be unfolded. One often hears people say that they were quite surprised at the proofs of affection which came to them when they were in trouble. They would have been happier and more nearly right if they had believed in them when there was no need to show them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II. Consciousness of Christ-given independence and of ‘content’ is scarcely Paul’s whole idea here, though that, no doubt, is included. We have no word which exactly expresses the meaning. ‘Self-sufficient’ is a translation, but then it has acquired a bad meaning as connoting a false estimate of one’s own worth and wisdom. What Paul means is that whatever be his condition he has in himself enough to meet it. He does not depend on circumstances, and he does not depend on other people for strength to face them. Many words are not needed to insist that only the man of whom these things are true is worth calling a man at all. It is a miserable thing to be hanging on externals and so to be always exposed to the possibility of having to say, ‘They have taken away my Gods.’ It is as wretched to be hanging on people. ‘The good man shall be satisfied for himself.’ The fortress that has a deep well in the yard and plenty of provisions within, is the only one that can hold out.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This independence teaches the true use of all changing circumstances. The consequence of ‘learning’ therewith to be content is further stated by the Apostle in terms which perhaps bear some reference to the mysteries of Greek religion, since the word rendered ‘I have learned the secret’ means I have been initiated. He can bear either of the two extremes of human experience, and can keep a calm and untroubled mind whichever of them he has to front. He has the same equable spirit when abased and when abounding. He is like a compensation pendulum which corrects expansions and contractions and keeps time anywhere. I remember hearing of a captain in an Arctic expedition who had been recalled from the Tropics and sent straight away to the North Pole. Sometimes God gives His children a similar experience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is possible for us not only to bear with equal minds both extremes, but to get the good out of both. It is a hard lesson and takes much conning, to learn to bear sorrow or suffering or want. They have great lessons to teach us all, and a character that has not been schooled by one of these dwellers in the dark is imperfect as celery is not in season till frost has touched it. But it is not less difficult to learn how to bear prosperity and abundance, though we think it a pleasanter lesson. To carry a full cup without spilling is proverbially difficult, and one sees instances enough of men who were far better men when they were poor than they have ever been since they were rich, to give a terrible significance to the assertion that it is still more difficult to live a Christian life in prosperity than in sorrow. But while both threaten, both may minister to our growth. Sorrow will drive, and joy will draw, us nearer to God. If we are not tempted by abundance to plunge our desires into it, nor tempted by sorrow to think ourselves hopelessly harmed by it, both will knit us more closely to our true and changeless good. The centrifugal and centripetal forces both keep the earth in its orbit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is only when we are independent of circumstances that we are able to get the full good of them. When there is a strong hand at the helm, the wind, though it be almost blowing directly against us, helps us forward, but otherwise the ship drifts and washes about in the trough. We all need the exhortation to be their master, for we can do without them and they serve us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul here lets us catch a glimpse of the inmost secret of his power without which all exhortations to independence are but waste words. He is conscious of a living power flowing through him and making him fit for anything, and he is not afraid that any one who studies him will accuse him of exaggeration even when he makes the tremendous claim ‘I can do all things in Him that strengtheneth me.’ That great word is even more emphatic in the original, not only because, as the Revised Version shows, it literally is in and not through , and so suggests again his familiar thought of a vital union with Jesus, but also because he uses a compound word which literally means ‘strengthening within,’ so then the power communicated is breathed into the man, and in the most literal sense he is ‘strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.’ This inward impartation of strength is the true and only condition of that self-sufficingness which Paul has just been claiming. Stoicism breaks down because it tries to make men apart from God sufficient for themselves, which no man is. To stand alone without Him is to be weak. Circumstances will always be too strong for me, and sins will be too strong. A Godless life has a weakness at the heart of its loneliness, but Christ and I are always in the majority, and in the face of all foes, be they ever so many and strong, we can confidently say, ‘They that be with us are more than they that be with them.’ The old experience will prove true in our lives, and though ‘they compass us about like bees,’ the worst that they can do is only to buzz angrily round our heads, and their end is in the name of the Lord to be destroyed. In ourselves we are weak, but if we are ‘rooted, grounded, built’ on Jesus, we partake of the security of the rock of ages to which we are united, and cannot be swept away by the storm, so long as it stands unmoved. I have seen a thin hair-stemmed flower growing on the edge of a cataract and resisting the force of its plunge, and of the wind that always lives in its depths, because its roots are in a cleft of the cliff. The secret of strength for all men is to hold fast by the ‘strong Son of God,’ and they only are sufficient in whatsoever state they are, to whom this loving and quickening voice has spoken the charter ‘My grace is sufficient for thee.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The renewed thanks for the loving sympathy expressed in the gift.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have here again an eager anxiety not to be misunderstood as undervaluing the Philippians’ gift. How beautifully the sublimity of the previous words lies side by side with the lowliness and gentleness of these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We note here the combination of that grand independence with loving thankfulness for brotherly help. The self-sufficingness of Stoicism is essentially inhuman and isolating. It is contrary to God’s plan and to the fellowship which is meant to knit men together. So we have always to take heed to blend with it a loving welcome to sympathy, and not to fancy that human help and human kindness is useless. We should be able to do without it, but that need not make it the less sweet when it comes. We may be carrying water for the march, but shall not the less prize a brook by the way. Our firm souls should be like the rocking stones in Cornwall, poised so truly that tempests cannot shake them, and yet vibrating at the touch of a little child’s soft hand. That lofty independence needs to be humanised by grateful acceptance of the refreshment of human sympathy even though we can do without it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul shows us here what is the true thing in a brother’s help for which to be thankful. The reason why he was glad of their help was because it spoke to his heart and told him that they were making themselves sharers with him in his troubles. As he tells us in the beginning of the letter, their fellowship in his labours had been from the beginning a joy to him. It was not so much their material help as their true sympathy that he valued. The high level to which he lifts what was possibly a very modest contribution, if measured by money standards, carries with it a great lesson for all receivers and for all givers of such gifts, teaching the one that they are purely selfish if they are glad of what they get, and bidding the other remember that they may give so as to hurt by a gift more than by a blow, that they may give infinitely more by loving sympathy than by much gold, and that a £5 note does not discharge all their obligations. We have to give after His pattern who does not toss us our alms from a height, but Himself comes to bestow them, and whose gift, though it be the unspeakable gift of eternal life, is less than the love it speaks, in that He Himself has in wondrous manner become partaker of our weakness. The pattern of all sympathy, the giver of all our possessions, is God. Let us hold to Him in faith and love, and all earthly love will be sweeter and sympathy more precious. Our own hearts will be refined and purified to a delicacy of consideration and a tenderness beyond their own. Our souls will be made lords of all circumstances and strengthened according to our need. He will say to us ‘My grace is sufficient for thee,’ and we, as we feel His strength being made perfect in our weakness, shall be able to say with humble confidence, ‘I can do all things in Christ who strengtheneth me within.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/philippians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">I rejoiced in the Lord greatly </span>— Who directs all events.

Lest, however, the Philippians might think this expression insinuated a complaint, that they had been negligent latterly, the apostle immediately adds, that they had always been careful to supply his wants, but had not had an opportunity till now.” Either they were in straitened circumstances themselves, or wanted a proper messenger by whom to send their bounty.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly - The favor which Paul had received, and for which he felt so much gratitude, had been received of the Philippians; but he regarded "the Lord" as the source of it, and rejoiced in it as the expression of his kindness. The effect was to lead his heart with cheerfulness and joy up to God.<p>That now at the last - After so long a time. The reason why he had not before received the favor, was not neglect or inattention on their part, but the difficulty of having communication with him.<p>Your care of me hath flourished again - In the margin this is rendered "is revived," and this is the proper meaning of the Greek word. It is a word properly applicable to plants or flowers, meaning to grow green again; to flourish again; to spring up again. Here the meaning is, that they had been again prospered in their care of him, and to Paul it seemed as if their care had sprung up anew.<p>Wherein ye were also careful - That is, they were desirous to render him assistance, and to minister to his wants. Paul adds this, lest they should think he was disposed to blame them for inattention.<p>But ye lacked opportunity - Because there were no persons going to Rome from Philippi by whom they could send to him.

The apostle proceeds to the last part of this epistle, and to take notice of the present which these Philippians had sent him, on account of which this his rejoicing was; and which was not small but great, and was not of a carnal but spiritual kind; it was a joy in the Holy Ghost, which is opposed to meats and drinks, and earthly enjoyments; it was a joy in the Lord; "in our Lord", as the Syriac version renders it; it was not so much on account of the nature, substance, quantity or quality of the things sent him, and the suitableness of them to his present necessity; but because this thing was of the Lord, he had put it into their hearts to do it, and had given them not only ability, but a willing mind, and had wrought in them both to will and to do; and because what they did they did for the sake of Christ, and to him as an apostle of his, and in obedience to Christ, and with a view to promote his cause and interest, honour and glory: <p>that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; which supposes that they had formerly, at the first preaching of the Gospel, showed great respect to him, and took great care of him, as appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>, but that for some time past, and it seems for a considerable while, they had dropped it, or at least had not shown it; but that now it revived again, and was seen in the present they had now sent him. The allusion is to trees, which in the summer season bear much fruit, in autumn cast their leaves, and in the winter are entirely bare, and in the spring of the year revive again, and put forth leaves and fruit: and just so it is with the saints, they are compared to trees, and are called trees of righteousness, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>, and are fruitful ones, <a href="/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>; but they have their winter seasons, when they are barren and unfruitful, and look as if they were dead; but when it is a spring time with them they revive again, as in the exercise of their faith and hope in Christ, so of their love to him, and to one another, and the ministers of the Gospel; when the south wind of the Spirit blows, the sun of righteousness arises, and, the dews of divine grace fall upon them; and such a revival was now in this church; and this was what the apostle so much rejoiced in, not so much for the gift bestowed on him, as for the fruit that appeared in them; see <a href="/philippians/4-17.htm">Philippians 4:17</a>; but whereas he had said that this care of him flourished again, "at last"; lest this should be thought as finding fault with them, and bringing a charge against them, he corrects himself by adding, <p>wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity; signifying that he believed they had entertained the same sentiments of him, had the same affection and inward care for him all along; but they had no opportunity of showing it, he being at such a distance, and they having no convenient or proper persons to send to him; or were hindered through multiplicity of business on their hands, that they could not attend to him; and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "but ye were busied", or taken up and employed in business; or it was for want of ability; for the words will bear to be rendered, "but ye lacked ability"; and to this sense does the Syriac version render it,   , "but ye were not sufficient"; or had not a sufficiency, were not able to do it, and therefore to be easily excused. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</span><p>(8) He witnesses that their liberality was acceptable to him, with which they helped him in his extreme poverty: but yet so moderating his words, that he might declare himself void of all suspicion of dishonesty, and that he has a mind content both with prosperity and adversity, and to be short, that he rests himself only in the will of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/philippians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>.

VII. p. 103; Kühner, II. 1, p. 265). An unfounded objection is brought against the view which explains it of the revival <span class="ital">of prosperity</span>, that it is inappropriate as a subject of joy <span class="ital">in the Lord</span> (see Weiss); it is appropriate at all events, when such a <span class="ital">use</span> is made of the revived prosperity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ φρονεῖν</span>] is usually, with the correct intransitive rendering of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΕΘΆΛ</span></span></span>.,[188] so understood that <span class="greekheb">τὸ</span> is taken together with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΡΟΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, and this must be regarded as the <span class="ital">accusative of more precise definition</span>, which is only distinguished by its greater emphasis from the mere epexegetical infinitive.

Comp. van Hengel: “negotium volo mihi consulendi.” But the whole view which takes <span class="greekheb">τό</span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΡΟΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span> is set aside by the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦʼ ᾯ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΦΡΟΝΕῖΤΕ</span></span></span>; seeing that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦʼ ᾯ</span></span></span>, unless it is to be rendered at variance with linguistic usage by <span class="ital">although</span> (Luther, Castalio, Michaelis, Storr), or <span class="ital">just as</span> (Vulgate, van Hengel), could only convey in its <span class="greekheb">ᾧ</span> the previous <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ὙΠῈΡ ἘΜΟῦ ΦΡΟΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, and would consequently yield the logically absurd conception: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦΡΟΝΕῖΤΕ ἘΠῚ Τῷ ὙΠῈΡ ἘΜΟῦ ΦΡΟΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, whether <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦʼ ᾯ</span></span></span> be taken as equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὟ ἝΝΕΚΑ</span></span></span> (Beza) or <span class="ital">qua de re</span> (Rheinwald, Matthies, de Wette, Wiesinger, Ewald, and others), or <span class="ital">in eo quod</span> (Erasmus), <span class="ital">in qua re</span> (Cornelius a Lapide, Hoelemann), or <span class="ital">et post id</span> (Grotius), and the like. Recourse has been had, by way of helping the matter, to the suggestion that <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν ἐπί</span> is a thinking <span class="ital">without action</span>, and <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν ὑπέρ</span> a thinking <span class="ital">with action</span> (de Wette, Wiesinger; comp.

Less arbitrarily, Calvin and Rilliet (“vous pensiez bien à moi”) have referred <span class="greekheb">ᾧ</span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΜΟῦ</span></span></span>, by which, no doubt, that logical awkwardness is avoided; but, on the other hand, the objection arises, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦʼ ᾯ</span></span></span> is elsewhere invariably used by Paul as <span class="ital">neuter</span> only, and that it is difficult to see why, if he desired to take up <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ</span> in a relative form, he should not have written <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠῈΡ ΟὟ</span></span></span>, since otherwise in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΊ</span></span></span>, if it merely went back to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΜΟῦ</span></span></span>, the more precise and definite reference which he must have had in view would not be expressed, and since the progress of the thought suggested not a change of <span class="ital">preposition</span>, but only the change of the <span class="ital">tenses</span> (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐφρονεῖτε</span>). Weiss, interpreting <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦʼ ᾯ</span></span></span> as: <span class="ital">about which</span> to take thought, refers it back to <span class="greekheb">ἀνεθάλετε</span>—a reference, however, which falls to the ground with the active interpretation of that word. Upon the whole, the only right course seems to be to <span class="ital">take</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ</span> <span class="ital">together</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν</span>, <a href="/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Php 2:20</a>; also <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΠΑΡʼ ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Php 4:18</a>; and see generally, Krüger, § 50. 5. 12; Kühner, II. 1, p. 231 f.), <span class="ital">and that as the accusative of the object to</span> <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span> (comp.

Very artificial, and for the simple reader hardly discoverable, is the view under which Hofmann takes the fact expressed by <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐφρονεῖτς</span> as the <span class="ital">ground, “upon, or on account of, which their re-emergence from an unfavourable position has been a revival unto care for him.”</span> If the reference of <span class="greekheb">ἰφʼ ᾧ</span> to <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ</span> were not directly given in the text, it would be much simpler to take <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ</span> as in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>, <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>, in the sense of <span class="ital">propterea quod,</span> and that as a graceful and ingenious specification of the reason for the <span class="ital">great joy</span> of the apostle, that they had flourished again to take thought for his benefit; for their previous omission had been caused not by any lack of the <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span> in question, but by the unfavourableness of the times.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity....">Php 4:10-14</a>.

The Philippians had sent St Paul a subsidy, or subsidies, before; but for reasons beyond their control there had been a rather long interval before this last.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your care of me hath flourished</span>] Better, <span class="bld">you have shot forth thought</span> (as a branch or bud) <span class="bld">for me</span>; or, less lit., <span class="bld">you have burgeoned into thought for me</span>.—The verb, only intransitive in the classics, is also transitive in LXX. (see <a href="/ezekiel/17-24.htm" title="And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.">Ezekiel 17:24</a>) and Apocrypha (see <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-14.htm" title="To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was created with the faithful in the womb.">Sir 1:14</a>). The poetic boldness of the phrase is noticeable; our second alternative translation fairly represents it. Perhaps the courteous kindliness of the Apostle’s thought comes out in it; an almost pleasantry of expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wherein</span>] Or, <span class="bld">whereon</span>; “with a view to which”; i.e., as the previous words imply, with a view to an effort to aid him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye were careful</span>] <span class="bld">Ye took thought</span>. The verb (<span class="ital">phroneîn</span>) is quite different from that in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Php 4:6</a>. It bears here (and just above, where its infinitive is represented by the English noun “thought”) the unusual meaning of <span class="ital">definite thinking</span>, not, as usual, that of <span class="ital">being in a mental state</span>. See on <a href="/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The gracious, sympathetic recognition of good intentions is indeed <span class="ital">Christian</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lacked opportunity</span>] Particularly, a suitable <span class="ital">bearer</span> had not been forthcoming.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μεγάλως</span>, <span class="ital">greatly</span>) This would scarcely have pleased a Stoic.

The deputation from the Philippians seems to have been appointed in Spring, from which, accordingly, the metaphor is taken. The phrase, wanted opportunity [referring to the past time] agrees with Winter.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ</span>) The accusative <span class="greekheb">τὸ</span> is governed by <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span>; <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ</span> is said, as <span class="greekheb">τὰ παρʼ ὑμῶν</span>, <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Php 4:18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ</span>, ) proportion, or to that which, according to the fact that: <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθεραπεία</span>.[55]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἨΚΑΙΡΕῖΣΘΕ</span>) <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΙΡῸς</span></span></span>, by Synecdoche, denotes all ability and opportunity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] See App. An after mitigation or qualification of the previous words by way of conciliating the readers.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again</span>. St. Paul thanks the Philippian Church for the gifts brought by Epaphroditus; his expressions, so courteous and yet so dignified, bespeak, like the Epistle to Philemon, like all his writings, the perfect gentleman in the best sense of the word. <span class="accented">I rejoiced in the Lord</span>; he fulfils his own precept (ver. 4). His joy rises kern the gift to the love which prompted the gift, and thence to the Divine Giver of that love. <span class="accented">Greatly.</span> Bengel says, "Hoc vix placuerit Stoico. Paulus ingentes affectns habuit, sed in Domino." The R.V. rendering of the following words is more literal: "Ye revived your thought for me." The verb is properly used of a tree putting forth fresh shoots after its winter sleep. Bengel thinks that the metaphor was derived from the season; the apostle was writing in the spring. Offsets, as Meyer, render differently, "<span class="accented">Ye</span> flourished again (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in your circumstances) so as to mind my interests." As the words might seem to imply some degree of blame, St. Paul hastens to ascribe the delay of the Philippians to causes beyond their own control. Wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity; more literally, <span class="accented">wherein ye did indeed take thought</span>, as R.V. It may be that they had no suitable messenger; but St. Paul speaks of the "deep poverty" of the Macedonian Churches in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1, 2</a>, where he also praises their liberality. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Your care of me hath flourished again (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., ye caused your thinking on my behalf to bloom anew.
