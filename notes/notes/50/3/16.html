The original runs thus: <span class= "ital">Nevertheless</span>—<span class= "ital">as to that to which we did attain</span>—<span class= "ital">let us walk by the same.</span> The word “walk” is always used of pursuing a course deliberately chosen. (See <a href="/acts/21-24.htm" title="Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.">Acts 21:24</a>; <a href="/romans/4-12.htm" title="And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.">Romans 4:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-25.htm" title="If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.">Galatians 5:25</a>.) The nearest parallel (from which the gloss is partly taken) is <a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>, “As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them.” In this passage there seems to be the same double reference which has pervaded all St. Paul’s practical teaching. He is anxious for two things—that they should keep on in one course, and that all should keep on together. In both senses he addresses the “perfect;” he will have them understand that they have attained only one thing—to be in the right path, and that it is for them to continue in it; he also bids them refrain from setting themselves up above “the imperfect;” for the very fact of division would mark them as still “carnal,” mere “babes in Christ” (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1Corinthians 3:1-4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE RULE OF THE ROAD</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Php 3:16</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul has just been laying down a great principle--viz. that if the main direction of a life be right, God will reveal to a man the points in which he is wrong. But that principle is untrue and dangerous, unless carefully guarded. It may lead to a lazy tolerance of evil, and to drawing such inferences as, ‘Well! it does not much matter about strenuous effort, if we are right at bottom it will all come right by-and-by,’ and so it may become a pillow for indolence and a clog on effort. This possible abuse of a great truth seems to strike the Apostle, and so he enters here, with this ‘Nevertheless,’ a caveat against that twist of his meaning. It is as if he said, ‘Now mind! while all that is perfectly true, it is true on conditions; and if they be not attended to, it is not true.’ God will reveal to a man the things in which he is wrong if, and only if, he steadfastly continues in the course which he knows and sees to be right. Present attainments, then, are in some sense a standard of duty, and if we honestly and conscientiously observe that standard we shall get light as we journey. In this exhortation of the Apostle’s there are many exhortations wrapped up; and in trying to draw them out I venture to adhere to the form of exhortation for the sake of impressiveness and point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. First, then, I would say the Apostle means, ‘Live up to your faith and your convictions.’</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may be a question whether ‘that to which we have already attained’ means the amount of knowledge which we have won or the amount of practical righteousness which we have made our own. But I think that, instead of sharply dividing between these two, we shall follow more in the course of the Apostle’s thought if we unite them together, and remember that the Bible does not make the distinct separation which we sometimes incline to make between knowledge on the one side and practice on the other, but regards the man as a living unity. And thus, both aspects of our attainments come into consideration here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, then, there are two main thoughts--first, live out your creed, and second, live up to your convictions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Live out your creed. Men are meant to live, not by impulse, by accident, by inclination, but by principle. We are not intended to live by rule, but we are intended to live by law. And unless we know why we do as well as what we do, and give a rational account of our conduct, we fall beneath the height on which God intends us to walk. Impulse is all very well, but impulse is blind and needs a guide. The imitation of those around us, or the acceptance of the apparent necessities of circumstances, are, to some extent, inevitable and right. But to be driven merely by the force of externals is to surrender the highest prerogative of manhood. The highest part of human nature is the reason guided by conscience, and a man’s conscience is only then rightly illuminated when it is illuminated by his creed, which is founded on the acceptance of the revelation that God has made of Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And whilst we are clearly meant to be guided by the intelligent appropriation of God’s truth, that truth is evidently all meant for guidance. We are not told anything in the Bible in order that we may know as an ultimate object, but we are told it all in order that, knowing, we may be, and, being, we may do, according to His will.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Just think of the intensely practical tendency of all the greatest truths of Christianity. The Cross is the law of life. The revelation that was made there was made, not merely that we might cling to it as a refuge from our sins, but that we might accept it as the rule of our conduct. All our duties to mankind are summed up in the word ‘Love one another as I have loved you.’ We say that we believe in the divinity of Christ; we say that we believe in the great incarnation and sacrificial death and eternal priesthood of the loving Son of God. We say that we believe in a judgment to come and a future life. Well, then, do these truths produce any effect upon my life? have they shaped me in any measure into conformity with their great principles? Does there issue from them constraining power which grasps me and moulds me as a sculptor would a bit of clay in his hands? Am I subject to the Gospel’s authority, and is the word in which God has revealed Himself to me the word which dominates and impels all my life? ‘Whereunto we have already attained, by the same let us walk.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But we shall not do that without a distinct effort. For it is a great deal easier to live from hand to mouth than to live by principle. It is a great deal easier to accept what seems forced upon us by circumstances than to exercise control over the circumstances, and make them bend to God’s holy will. It is a great deal easier to take counsel of inclination, and to put the reins in the hands of impulses, passions, desires, tastes, or even habits, than it is, at each fresh moment, to seek for fresh impulses from a fresh illumination from the ancient and yet ever fresh truth. The old kings of France used to be kept with all royal state in the palace, but they were not allowed to do anything. And there was a rough, unworshipped man that stood by their side, and who was the real ruler of the realm. That is what a great many professing Christians do with their creeds. They instal them in some inner chamber that they very seldom visit, and leave them there, in dignified idleness, and the real working ruler of their lives is found elsewhere. Let us see to it, brethren, that all our thoughts are incarnated in our deeds, and that all our deeds are brought into immediate connection with the great principles of God’s word. Live by that law, and we live at liberty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And, then, remember that this translating of creed into conduct is the only condition of growing illumination. When we act upon a belief, the belief grows. That is the source of a great deal of stupid obstinacy in this world, because men have been so long accustomed to go upon certain principles that it seems incredible to them but that these principles should be true. But that, too, is at the bottom of a great deal of intelligent and noble firmness of adherence to the true. A man who has tested a principle because he has lived upon it has confidence in it that nobody else can have.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Projectors may have beautiful specifications with attractive pictures of their new inventions; they look very well upon paper, but we must see them working before we are sure of their worth. And so, here is this great body of Divine truth, which assumes to be sufficient for guidance, for conduct, for comfort, for life. Live upon it, and thereby your grasp of it and your confidence in it will be immensely increased. And no man has a right to say ‘I have rejected Christianity as untrue,’ unless he has put it to the test by living upon it; and if he has, he will never say it. A Swiss traveller goes into a shop and buys a brand-new alpenstock. Does he lean upon it with as much confidence as another man does, who has one with the names of all the mountains that it has helped him up branded on it from top to bottom? Take this staff and lean on it. Live your creed, and you will believe your creed as you never will until you do. Obedience takes a man up to an elevation from which he sees further into the deep harmonies of truth. In all regions of life the principle holds good: ‘To him that hath shall be given.’ And it holds eminently in reference to our grasp of Christian principles. Use them and they grow; neglect them and they perish. Sometimes a man dies in a workhouse who has a store of guineas and notes wrapped up in rags somewhere about him; and so they have been of no use to him. If you want your capital to increase, trade with it. As the Lord said when He gave the servants their talents: ‘Trade with them till I come.’ The creed that is utilised is the creed that grows. And that is why so many of you Christian people have so little real intellectual grasp of the principles of Christianity, because you have not lived upon them, nor tried to do it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And, in like manner, another side of this thought is, be true to your convictions. There is no such barrier to a larger and wholesomer view of our duty as the neglect of anything that plainly is our duty. It stands there, an impassable cliff between us and all progress. Let us live and be what we know we ought to be, and we shall know better what we ought to be at the next moment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Secondly, let me put the Apostle’s meaning in another exhortation, Go on as you have begun.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Whereunto we have already attained, by the same let us walk.’ The various points to which the men have reached are all points in one straight line; and the injunction of my text is ‘Keep the road.’ There are a great many temptations to stray from it. There are nice smooth grassy bits by the side of it where it is a great deal easier walking. There are attractive things just a footstep or two out of the path--such a little deviation that it can easily be recovered. And so, like children gathering daisies in the field, we stray away from the path; and, like men on a moor, we then look round for it, and it is gone. The angle of divergence may be the acutest possible; the deviation when we begin may be scarcely visible, but if you draw a line at the sharpest angle and the least deviation from a straight line, and carry it out far enough, there will be space between it and the line from which it started ample to hold a universe. Then, let us take care of small deviations from the plain straight path, and give no heed to the seductions that lie on either side, but ‘whereunto we have already attained, by the same let us walk.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are temptations, too, to slacken our speed. The river runs far more slowly in its latter course than when it came babbling and leaping down the hillside. And sometimes a Christian life seems as if it crept rather than ran, like those sluggish streams in the Fen country, which move so slowly that you cannot tell which way the water is flowing. Are not there all round us, are there not amongst ourselves instances of checked growth, of arrested development? There are people listening to me now, calling themselves--and I do not say that they have not a right to do so--Christians, who have not grown a bit for years, but stand at the very same point of attainment, both in knowledge and in purity and Christlikeness, as they were many, many days ago. I beseech you, listen to this exhortation of my text, ‘Whereunto we have already attained, by the same let us walk,’ and continue patient and persistent in the course that is set before us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The Apostle’s injunction may be cast into this form, Be yourselves.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The representation which underlies my text, and precedes it in the context, is that of the Christian community as a great body of travellers all upon one road, all with their faces turned in one direction, but at very different points on the path. The difference of position necessarily involves a difference in outlook. They see their duties, and they see the Word of God, in some respects diversely. And the Apostle’s exhortation is: ‘Let each man follow his own insight, and whereunto he has attained, by that, and not by his brother’s attainment, by that let him walk.’ From the very fact of the diversity of advancement there follows the plain duty for each of us to use our own eyesight, and of independent faithfulness to our own measure of light, as the guide which we are bound to follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is a dreadful want, in the ordinary Christian life, of any appearance of first-hand communication with Jesus Christ, and daring to be myself, and to act on the insight into His will which Christ has given me .<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Conventional Godliness, Christian people cut after one pattern, a little narrow round of certain statutory duties and obligations, a parrot-like repetition of certain words, a mechanical copying of certain methods of life, an oppressive sameness, mark so much of modern religion. What a freshening up there would come into all Christian communities if every man lived by his own perception of truth and duty! If a musician in an orchestra is listening to his neighbour’s note and time, he will lose many an indication from the conductor that would have kept him far more right, if he had attended to it. And if, instead of taking our beliefs and our conduct from one another, or from the average of Christian men round us, we went straight to Jesus Christ and said to Him, ‘What wouldst Thou have me to do?’ there would be a different aspect over Christendom from what there is to-day. The fact of individual responsibility, according to the measure of our individual light, and faithful following of that, wheresoever it may lead us, are the grand and stirring principles that come from these words. ‘Whereunto we have already attained,’ by that--and by no other man’s attainment or rule--let us walk.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But do not let us forget that that same faithful independence and independent faithfulness because Christ speaks to us, and we will not let any other voice blend with His, are quite consistent with, and, indeed, demand, the frank recognition of our brother’s equal right. If we more often thought of all the great body of Christian people as an army, united in its diversity, its line of march stretching for leagues, and some in the van, and some in the main body, and some in the rear, but all one, we should be more tolerant of divergences, more charitable in our judgment of the laggards, more patient in waiting for them to come up with us, and more wise and considerate in moderating our pace sometimes to meet theirs. All who love Jesus Christ are on the same road and bound for the same home. Let us be contented that they shall be at different stages on the path, seeing that we know that they will all reach the Temple above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. Lastly, cherish the consciousness of imperfection and the confidence of success.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Whereunto we have attained’ implies that that is only a partial possession of a far greater whole. The road is not finished at the stage where we stand. And, on the other hand, ‘by the same let us walk,’ implies that beyond the present point the road runs on equally patent and pervious to our feet. These two convictions, of my own imperfection and of the certainty of my reaching the great perfectness beyond, are indispensable to all Christian progress. As soon as a man begins to think that he has realised his ideal, Good-bye! to all advance. The artist, the student, the man of business, all must have gleaming before them an unattained object, if they are ever to be stirred to energy and to run with patience the race that is set before them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The more distinctly that a man is conscious of his own imperfection in the Christian life, the more he will be stung and stirred into earnestness and energy of effort, if only, side by side with the consciousness of imperfection, there springs triumphant the confidence of success. That will give strength to the feeble knees; that will lift a man buoyant over difficulties; that will fire desire; that will stimulate and solidify effort; that will make the long, monotonous stretches of the road easy, the rough places plain, the crooked things straight. Over all reluctant, repellent duties it will bear us, in all weariness it will re-invigorate us. We are saved by hope, and the more brightly there burns before us, not as a tremulous hope, but as a future certainty, the thought, ‘I shall be like Him, for I shall see Him as He is,’ the more shall I set my face to the loved goal and my feet to the dusty road, and ‘press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God.’ Christian progress comes out of the clash and collision of these two things, like that of flint and steel--the consciousness of imperfection and the confidence of success. And they who thus are driven by the one and drawn by the other, in all their consciousness of failure are yet blessed, and are crowned at last with that which they believed before it came.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house’--the prize won is heaven. But ‘blessed are they in whose hearts are the ways’--the prize desired and strained after is heaven upon earth. We may all live a life of continual advancement, each step leading upwards, for the road always climbs, to purer air, grander scenery, and a wider view. And yonder, progress will still be the law, for they who here have followed the Lamb, and sought to make Him their pattern and Commander, will there ‘follow Him whithersoever He goeth.’ If here we walk according to that ‘whereunto we have attained,’ there He shall say, ‘They will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.’ <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule - This is a most wise and valuable rule, and a rule that would save much difficulty and contention in the church, if it were honestly applied. The meaning is this, that though there might be different degrees of attainment among Christians, and different views on many subjects, yet there were points in which all could agree; there were attainments which they all had made, and in reference to them they should walk in harmony and love. It might be that some had made much greater advances than others. They had more elevated views of religion; they had higher knowledge; they were nearer perfection. Others had had less advantages of education and instruction, had had fewer opportunities of making progress in the divine life, and would less understand the higher mysteries of the Christian life. They might not see the truth or propriety of many things which those in advance of them would see clearly.<p>But it was not worth while to quarrel about these things. There should be no angry feeling, and no fault-finding on either side. There were many things in which they could see alike, and where there were no jarring sentiments. In those things they could walk harmoniously; and they who were in advance of others should not complain of their less informed brethren as lacking all evidence of piety; nor should those who had not made such advances complain of those before them as fanatical, or as disposed to push things to extremes. They who had the higher views should, as Paul did, believe that God will yet communicate them to the church at large, and in the meantime should not denounce others; and those who had less elevated attainments should not censure their brethren as wild and visionary. There were common grounds on which they might unite, and thus the harmony of the church would be secured.<p>No better rule than this could be applied to the subjects of inquiry which spring up among Christians respecting temperance, slavery, moral reform, and the various doctrines of religion; and, if this rule had been always observed, the church would have been always saved from harsh contention and from schism. If a man does not see things just as I do, let me try with mildness to Teach him, and let me believe that, if he is a Christian, God will make this known to him yet; but let me not quarrel with him, for neither of us would be benefited by that, nor would the object be likely to be attained. In the meantime, there are many things in which we can agree. In them let us work together, and strive, as far as we can, to promote the common object. Thus we shall save our temper, give no occasion to the world to reproach us, and be much more likely to come together in all our views. The best way to make true Christians harmonious is, to labor together in the common cause of saying souls. As far as we can agree, let us go and labor together; and where we cannot yet, let us "agree to differ." We shall all think alike by-and-by. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Decisive against this view is the plural <span class="greekheb">ἐφθάσαμεν</span>, which, according to the context (<a href="/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Php 3:15</a>), cannot apply merely to Paul, as well as the fact that the antithesis of persons (<span class="ital">ego … ipsi</span>) is gratuitously introduced.

Comp. Schinz and van Hengel. This view is corroborated by the sequel, in which Paul represents himself as model of the <span class="ital">walk;</span> and therefore it is not to be referred merely to the measure of the right <span class="ital">frame of mind</span> attained (Weiss). Most expositors understand the words as signifying the measure of <span class="ital">Christian knowledge</span> acquired (so also Heinrichs, Flatt, Rheinwald, Matthies, Hoelemann, de Wette, Wiesinger), in conformity with which one ought to live. In connection with this, various arbitrary definitions of the <span class="ital">object</span> of the knowledge have been suggested, as, for instance, by Grotius: “de circumcisione et ritibus;” Heinrichs and de Wette: concerning the main substance of the Christian faith apart from secondary matters; Schneckenburger: “that man is justified by faith, and not by the works of the law;” along with which de Wette lays stress on the point that it is not the <span class="ital">individual</span> more or less perfect knowledge (so usually; see Flatt, Rheinwald, Matthies) that is meant, but the <span class="ital">collective conviction</span>, the truths <span class="ital">generally</span> recognised. But the whole interpretation which refers it to <span class="ital">knowledge</span> is not in keeping with the text; for <span class="greekheb">ἐφθάσαμεν</span>, correlative with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΟΙΧΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, presents together with the latter a <span class="ital">unity</span> of figurative view, the former denoting the point of the way already attained, and <span class="greekheb">τῷ αὐτῷ στοιχεῖν</span>, perseverance in the direction indicated by that attainment. Therefore, if by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΟΙΧΕῖΝ</span></span></span> there is clearly (see <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm" title="Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.">Php 3:17</a>) intended the moral conduct of life, this also must be denoted by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς Ὃ ἘΦΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> as respects its quality attained up to the present time. Moreover, if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς Ὃ ἘΦΘ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is to be understood as referring to <span class="ital">knowledge</span>, there would be no motive for the prominence given to the identity by <span class="greekheb">τῷ αὐτῷ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[170] This is thrown out as a suggestion also by Hofmann, according to whom the infinitive clause ought “perhaps more correctly” to be coupled with <span class="greekheb">συμμιμηταὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and taken as a prefixed designation of that <span class="ital">in doing which they are to be his imitators and to have their attention directed to those,</span> etc. Thus the infinitive would come to stand as infinitive of <span class="ital">the aim.</span> But even thus the whole attempt would be an artificial twisting of the passage without reason or use.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What Paul means in <a href="/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Php 3:16</a> may be illustrated thus:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here B is the point of the development of Christian life <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ ἐφθάσαμεν</span>, which, in the case of different individuals, may be more or less advanced. The <span class="greekheb">τῷ αὐτῷ στοιχεῖν</span> takes place, when the path traversed from A to B is continued in the direction of C. If any one should move from B in the direction of either D or E, he would not <span class="greekheb">τῷ αὐτῷ στοιχεῖν</span>. The reproach of <span class="ital">uncertainty</span> which Wiesinger brings against this canon, because a <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρως φρονεῖν</span> may take place which does not lie in the same direction, and generally because the power of sin might hinder the following out of this direction, would also apply in opposition to every other explanation of the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ ἐφθ</span>., and particularly to that of the <span class="ital">knowledge</span> attained; but it is altogether unfounded, first, because the <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρως φρονεῖν</span> only refers to one or another concrete <span class="ital">single point</span> (<span class="greekheb">τι</span>), so that the <span class="ital">whole</span> of moral attainment—the collective development—which has been reached is not thereby disturbed; and, secondly, because Paul in this case has to do with a church already <span class="ital">highly advanced</span> in a moral point of view (<a href="/philippians/1-5.htm" title="For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;">Php 1:5</a> ff.), which he might, at all events generally, enjoin to continue in the same direction as the path in which they had already travelled. Very groundless is also the objection urged by Hofmann, that the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ ἐφθ</span>. must necessarily be <span class="ital">one and the same for all</span>. This is simply to be denied; it is an utterly arbitrary assumption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Php 3:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">πλήν</span>. It is quite common as introducing a parenthesis. “Only one thing! So far as we have come, keep the path” (Weizs.). For the word <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Schmid, <span class="ital">Atticismus</span>, i., p. 133, and Bonitz’s <span class="ital">Index</span> to Aristotle.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ ἐφθάς</span>. In later Greek (as in modern) <span class="greekheb">φθάνω</span> has lost all idea of <span class="ital">anticipation</span> and simply means “come,” “reach”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/10-14.htm" title="For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:">2 Corinthians 10:14</a> (and see See Hatz., Einl, p. 199; <span class="ital">Sources of N.T. Greek</span>, p. 156). “So far as we have come.” In what? Weiss thinks in right <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span>, connecting the words immediately with <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο φρονῶμεν</span>. Kleiss supposes the <span class="greekheb">νόμος δικαιοσύνης</span>, referring to the earlier part of the chap. (esp <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>). Does he not rather mean the point reached on the advance towards the goal (the <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκειν</span>), which is the subject directly before his mind? The very use of <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖν</span> seems to justify this interpretation.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ αὐτῷ</span>. It is, at first sight, natural to refer <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>. immediately to <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> preceding. And this may be right. But there is much force in the interpretation of Lipsius, who renders “let us walk on the <span class="ital">same</span> path” (so also Hlst.). The exhortation would then be directed against the difference of opinion and feeling which were certainly present in the Church at Philippi, and is suggested to Paul by the <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρως φρον</span>. of <a href="/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Php 3:15</a>. That this was an early interpretation is shown by the <span class="ital">v.l.</span> of <span class="ital">TR.</span> The words <span class="greekheb">κανονι το αυτο φρονειν</span> (not found in the best MSS.) are evidently a gloss on the text. “Only, so far as we have come, let us keep to the same path.” <span class="greekheb">τῷ αὐτῷ</span> is an instance of a dative common after verbs of “going” and “walking” in N.T. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Buttm., <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 184.—<span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖν</span>. An imperatival infinitive found in Hom., Aristoph., Inscrptions (see Meisterhans, <span class="ital">Gram. d. att. Inschrr.</span>, § 88 A; Viteau, <span class="ital">Le Verbe</span>, p. 147). Probably this usage is closely connected with the origin of the infinitive, which was a dative, as is shown, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by the infinitive in English, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, “to work”. This might easily become an imperative, “to work”! Analogous is the use of <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὑγιαίνειν</span> in Letters. <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. is only found in late writers, although, from the frequency of <span class="greekheb">στοῖχος</span>, we may infer that it must have existed in earlier times. Literally it means “march in file”. Moule well observes that <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. more than <span class="greekheb">περιπατεῖν</span> (the common word) suggests the <span class="ital">step</span>, the detail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/philippians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Nevertheless</span>] Better, with R.V., <span class="bld">only</span>; a word, like the Greek, of less contrast and easier transition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">attained</span>] Not the same Greek verb as that in <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a>, though R.V. (with A.V.) gives the same English. The verb here is properly used, in classical Greek, of anticipation (so <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>), arrival beforehand, rapid arrival. Later, and so ordinarily in N.T., it loses much at least of this speciality, and means little besides “to reach,” “to arrive.” Still, a shadow of the first meaning may be traced in most places; a suggestion of an arrival which is either sudden, or achieved in spite of obstacles. The latter idea would be in place here, where the metaphor of the race with its difficulties is still present; as if to say, “whereunto we have <span class="ital">succeeded</span> in arriving.”—The verb is in the aorist, but the English perfect is obviously right.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>let us <span class="ital">walk by the same</span> &c.] The Greek verb is in the infinitive, “<span class="ital">to walk</span>”; a frequent idiomatic substitute for the mood of command or appeal. Apparently this construction is always used in address <span class="ital">to others</span> (see Alford here), and thus we should render “<span class="ital">walk ye</span> &c.”—The verb here rendered “walk” means not only movement on the feet in general, but orderly and guided walking, stepping along a line. The appeal is to take care of Christian consistency in detail, up to the full present light, on the unchanging principles of the Gospel, which are essentially “the same” for all. And there is a reference, doubtless, in the words “the same,” to the Philippians’ tendency to differences of opinion and feeling.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words after “<span class="ital">by the same</span>” are an excellent explanation, but not part of the text.

The word <span class="greekheb">κανόνι</span> seems evidently to have been brought hither from <a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ</span>) There is here an Asyndeton.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ αὐτὸ φρονεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to mind the same thing</span>) He returns to this topic, ch. <a href="/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Php 4:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[45] AB Memph.

Vulg., with Rec. Text, retains <span class="greekheb">κανόνι</span>, but transposes the Order. Rec.

This explanation seems more probable than the other view, which understands the words, "by the same," of the rule of faith as opposed to the works of the Law. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Nevertheless<p>Rev., only.
