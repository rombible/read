Here, on the contrary, it stands nearly in the middle of the Epistle. Moreover, the commendation above of Timothy and Epaphroditus is exactly that which, according to St. Paul’s custom, would mark the final sentences of the whole. Again, the words “rejoice in the Lord” may, according to the common usage of the time (although certainly that usage is not adopted in other Letters of St. Paul), not improbably signify <span class= "ital">farewell in the Lord;</span> and even if not used in this formal and conventional sense, yet certainly hold the position of final good wishes, which that sense implies. The resumption of them in <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm" title="Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.">Philippians 4:4</a>, where the actual conclusion now begins, is striking. It seems, therefore, highly probable, that in this place the Letter was originally drawing to an end, and that some news was at that moment brought which induced the Apostle to add a second part, couched in language of equal affection, but of greater anxiety and more emphatic warning. Of such a break, and resumption with a far more complete change of style, we have a notable instance at the beginning of the tenth chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians; as also of the addition of postscript after postscript in the last chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.<p>[<span class= "bld">7.Words of Warning </span>(<a href="/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

Hence it is far better to refer them to the abrupt and incisive warnings that follow.<p>These, then, are said to be a repetition; but of what? Hardly of the former part of this Epistle, for it is difficult there to find anything corresponding to them. If not, then it must be of St. Paul’s previous teaching, by word or by letter. For the use here of the word “to write,” though it suits better the idea of former communication by writing, cannot exclude oral teaching. That there was more than one Epistle to Philippi has been inferred (probably, but not certainly) from an expression in Polycarp’s letter to the Philippians (sect. 3), speaking of “the Epistles” of St. Paul to them. It is not in itself unlikely that another Epistle should have been written; nor have we any right to argue decisively against it, on the ground that no such Epistle is found in the canon of Scripture. But however this may be, it seems natural to refer to St. Paul’s former teaching as a whole. Now, when St. Paul first preached at Philippi, he had not long before carried to Antioch the decree of the council against the contention of “them of the circumcision;” and, as it was addressed to the churches “of Syria and Cilicia,” he can hardly have failed to communicate it, when he passed through both regions “confirming the churches” (<a href="/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>). At Thessalonica, not long after, the jealousy of the Jews at his preaching the freedom of the gospel drove him from the city (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>). When he came to Macedonia on his next journey, the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written there and probably at Philippi, marks the first outburst of the Judaising controversy; and when he returned to Philippi, on his way back, he had just written the Epistles to the Galatians and Romans, which deal exhaustively with the whole question. Nothing is more likely than that his teaching at Philippi had largely dealt with the warning against the Judaisers. What, then, more natural than to introduce a new warning on the subject—shown to be necessary by news received—with the courteous half-apology, “To write the same things to you, to me is not grievous (or, <span class= "ital">tedious</span>) but for you it is safe,” making assurance doubly sure?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">PREPARING TO END</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="/context/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe....">Php 3:1-3</a> {R.V.}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first words of the text show that Paul was beginning to think of winding up his letter, and the preceding context also suggests that. The personal references to Timothy and Epaphroditus would be in their appropriate place near the close, and the exhortation with which our text begins is also most fitting there, for it is really the key-note of the letter. How then does he come to desert his purpose? The answer is to be found in his next advice, the warning against the Judaising teachers who were his great antagonists all his life. A reference to them always roused him, and here the vehement exhortation to mark them well and avoid them opens the flood-gates. Forgetting all about his purpose to come to an end, he pours out his soul in the long and precious passage which follows. Not till the next chapter does he get back to his theme in the reiterated exhortation {iv. 4}, ‘Rejoice in the Lord alway; again I will say, rejoice.’ This outburst is very remarkable, for its vehemence is so unlike the tone of the rest of the letter. That is calm, joyous, bright, but this is stormy and impassioned, full of flashing and scathing words, the sudden thunder-storm breaks in on a mellow, autumn day, but it hurtles past and the sun shines out again, and the air is clearer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another question suggested is the reference of the second half of verse 1. What are ‘the same things’ to write which is ‘safe’ for the Philippians? Are they the injunctions preceding to ‘rejoice in the Lord,’ or that following, the warning against the Judaisers? The former explanation may be recommended by the fact that ‘Rejoice’ is in a sense the key-note of the Epistle, but on the other hand, the things where repetition would be ‘safe’ would most probably be warnings against some evil that threatened the Philippians’ Christian standing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no attempt at unity in the words before us, and I shall not try to force them into apparent oneness, but follow the Apostle’s thoughts as they lie. We note--<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The crowning injunction as to the duty of Christian gladness.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A very slight glance over the Epistle will show how continually the note of gladness is struck in it. Whatever in Paul’s circumstances was ‘at enmity with joy’ could not darken his sunny outlook. This bird could sing in a darkened cage. If we brought together the expressions of his joy in this letter, they would yield us some precious lessons as to what were the sources of his, and what may be the sources of ours. There runs through all the instances in the Epistle the implication which comes out most emphatically in his earnest exhortation, ‘Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.’ The true source of true joy lies in our union with Jesus. To be in Him is the condition of every good, and, just as in the former verses ‘trust in the Lord ‘ is set forth, so the joy which comes from trust is traced to the same source. The joy that is worthy, real, permanent, and the ally of lofty endeavour and noble thoughts has its root in union with Jesus, is realised in communion with Him, has Him for its reason or motive, and Him for its safeguard or measure. As the passages in question in this Epistle show, such joy does not shut out but hallows other sources of satisfaction. In our weakness creatural love and kindness but too often draw us away from our joy in Him. But with Paul the sources which we too often find antagonistic were harmoniously blended, and flowed side by side in the same channel, so that he could express them both in the one utterance, ‘I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We do not sufficiently realise the Christian duty of Christian joy, some of us even take mortified countenances and voices in a minor key as marks of grace, and there is but little in any of us of ‘the joy in the Lord’ which a saint of the Old Testament had learned was our ‘strength.’ There is plenty of gladness amongst professing Christians, but a good many of them would resent the question, is your gladness ‘in the Lord’? No doubt any deep experience in the Christian life makes us aware of much in ourselves that saddens, and may depress, and our joy in Him must always be shaded by penitent sorrow for ourselves. But that necessary element of sadness in the Christian life is not the cause why so many Christian lives have little of the buoyancy and hope and spontaneity which should mark them. The reason rather lies in the lack of true union with Christ, and habitual keeping of ourselves ‘in the love of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Paul’s apology for reiteration.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He is going to give once more old and well-worn precepts which are often very tedious to the hearer, and not much less so to the speaker. He can only say that to him the repetition of familiar injunctions is not ‘irksome,’ and that to them it is ‘safe.’ The diseased craving for ‘originality’ in the present day tempts us all, hearers and speakers alike, and we ever need to be reminded that the staple of Christian teaching must be old truths reiterated, and that it is not time to stop proclaiming them until all men have begun to practise them. But a speaker must try to make the thousandth repetition of a truth fresh to himself, and not a wearisome form, or a dead commonplace, by freshening it to his own mind and by living on it in his own practice, and the hearers must remember that it is only the completeness of their obedience that antiquates the commandment. The most threadbare commonplace becomes a novelty when occasions for its application arise in our own lives, just as a prescription may lie long unnoticed in a drawer, but when a fever attacks its possessor it will be quickly drawn out and worth its weight in gold.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Paul’s warning against teachers of a ceremonial religion.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It scarcely seems congruous with the tone of the rest of this letter that the preachers whom Paul so scathingly points out here had obtained any firm footing in the Philippian Church, but no doubt there, as everywhere, they had dogged Paul’s footsteps, and had tried as they always did to mar his work. They had not missionary fervour or Christian energy enough to initiate efforts amongst the Gentiles so as to make them proselytes, but when Paul and his companions had made them Christians, they did their best, or their worst, to insist that they could not be truly Christians, unless they submitted to the outward sign of being Jews. Paul points a scathing finger at them when he bids the Philippians ‘beware,’ and he permits himself a bitter retort when he lays hold of the Jewish contemptuous word for Gentiles which stigmatised them as ‘dogs,’ that is profane and unclean, and hurls it back at the givers. But he is not indulging in mere bitter retorts when he brings against these teachers the definite charge that they are ‘evil workers.’ People who believed that an outward observance was the condition of salvation would naturally be less careful to insist upon holy living. A religion of ceremonies is not a religion of morality. Then the Apostle lets himself go in a contemptuous play of words, and refuses to recognise that these sticklers for circumcision had themselves been circumcised. ‘I will not call them the circumcision, they have not been circumcised, they have only been gashed and mutilated, it has been a mere fleshly maiming.’ His reason for denying the name to them is his profound belief that it belonged to true Christians. His contemptuous reference puts in a word, the principle which he definitely states in another place, ‘He is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle here is not only telling us who are the truly circumcised, but at the same time he is telling us what makes a Christian, and he states three points in which, as I take it, he begins at the end and works backwards to the beginning. ‘We are the circumcision who worship in the Spirit of God’--that is the final result--’and glory in Christ Jesus’--’and have no confidence in the flesh’--that is the starting-point. The beginning of all true Christianity is distrust of self. What does Paul mean by ‘flesh’? Body? Certainly not. Animal nature, or the passions rooted in it? Not only these, as may be seen by noting the catalogue which follows of the things in the flesh, in which he might have trusted. What are these? ‘Circumcised the eighth day, of the tribe of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews’--these belong to ritual and race; ‘as touching the law a Pharisee’--that belongs to ecclesiastical standing; ‘concerning zeal persecuting the church’--that has nothing to do with the animal nature: ‘touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless’--that concerns the moral nature. All these come under the category of the ‘flesh,’ which, therefore, plainly includes all that belongs to humanity apart from God. Paul’s old-fashioned language translated into modern English just comes to this--it is vain to trust in external connection with the sacred community of the Church, or in participation in any of its ordinances and rites. To Paul, Christian rites and Jewish rites were equally rites and equally insufficient as bases of confidence. Do not let us fancy that dependence on these is peculiar to certain forms of Christian belief. It is a very subtle all-pervasive tendency, and there is no need to lift up Nonconformist hands in holy horror at the corruptions of Romanism and the like. Their origin is not solely priestly ambition, but also the desires of the so-called laity. Demand creates a supply, and if there were not people to think, ‘Now it shall be well with me because I have a Levite for my priest,’ there would be no Levites to meet their wishes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Notice that Paul includes amongst the things belonging to the flesh this ‘touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless.’ Many of us can say the same. We do our duties so far as we know them, and are respectable law-abiding people, but if we are trusting to that, we are of the ‘flesh.’ Have we estimated what God is, and what the real worth of our conduct is? Have we looked not at our actions but at our motives, and seen them as they are seen from above or from the inside? How many ‘blameless’ lives are like the scenes in a theatre, effective and picturesque, when seen with the artificial glory of the footlights? But go behind the scenes and what do we find? Dirty canvas and cobwebs. If we know ourselves we know that a life may have a fair outside, and yet not be a thing to trust to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The beginning of our Christianity is the consciousness that we are ‘naked and poor, and blind, and in need of all things.’ Men come to Jesus Christ by many ways, thank God, and I care little by what road they come so long as they get there, nor do I insist upon any stereotyped order of religious experience. But of this I am very sure: that unless we abandon confidence in ourselves, because we have seen ourselves in the light of God’s law, we have not learned all that we need nor laid hold of all that Christ gives. Let us measure ourselves in the light of God, and we shall learn that we have to take our places beside Job, when the vision of God silenced his protestations of innocence. ‘I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee; wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That self-distrust should pass into glorying in Christ Jesus. If a man has learned his emptiness he will look about for something to fill it. Unless I know myself to be under condemnation because of my sin, and fevered, disturbed, and made wretched, by its inward consequences which forbid repose, the sweetest words of Gospel invitation will pass by me like wind whistling through an archway. But if once I have been driven from self-confidence, then like music from heaven will come the word, ‘Trust in Jesus.’ The seed dropped into the ground puts out a downward-going shoot, which is the root, and an upward-growing one, which is the stalk. The downward-going shoot is ‘no confidence in the flesh,’ the upward-going is ‘glorying in Christ Jesus.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But that word suggests the blessed experience of triumph in the possession of the Person known and felt to be all, and to give all that life needs. A true Christian should ever be triumphant in a felt experience, in a Name proved to be sufficient, in a power which infuses strength into his weakness, and enables him to do the will of God. It is for want of utter self-distrust and absolute faith in Christ that ‘glorying’ in Him is so far beyond the ordinary mood of the average Christian. You say, ‘I hope, sometimes I doubt, sometimes I fear, sometimes I tremblingly trust.’ Is that the kind of experience that these words shadow? Why do we continue amidst the mist when we might rise into the clear blue above the obscuring pall? Only because we are still in some measure clinging to self, and still in some measure distrusting our Lord. If our faith were firm and full our ‘glorying’ would be constant. Do not be contented with the prevailing sombre type of Christian life which is always endeavouring, and always foiled, which is often doubting and often indifferent, but seek to live in the sunshine, and expatiate in the light, and ‘rejoice in the Lord always.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Glorying’ not only describes an attitude of mind, but an activity of life. Many things to-day tempt Christian people to speak of their religion and of their Lord in an apologetic tone, in the face of strong and educated unbelief; but if we have within us, as we all may have, and ought to have, the triumphant assurance of His sufficiency, nearness, and power, it will not be with bated breath that we shall speak of our Master, or apologise for our Christianity, but we shall obey the commandment, ‘Lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid.’ Ring out the name and be proud that you can ring it out, as the Name of your Lord, and your Saviour, and your all-sufficient Friend. Whatever other people say, you have the experience, if you are a Christian, which more than answers all that they can say.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have said that the final result set forth here by Paul is, ‘We worship by the Spirit of God.’ The expression translated worship is the technical word for rendering priestly service. Just as Paul has asserted that uncircumcised Christians, not circumcised Jews, are the true circumcision, so he asserts that they are the true priests, and that these officials in the outward temple at Jerusalem have forfeited the title, and that it has passed over to the despised followers of the despised Nazarene. If we have ‘no confidence in the flesh,’ and are ‘glorying in Christ Jesus,’ we are all priests of the most high God. ‘Worship in the Spirit’ is our function and privilege. The externals of ceremonial worship dwindle into insignificance. They may be means of helping, or they may be means of hindering, the ‘worship in the Spirit,’ which I venture to think all experience shows is the more likely to be pure and real, the less it invokes the aid of flesh and sense. To make the senses the ladder for the soul by which to climb to God is quite as likely to end in the soul’s going down the ladder as up it. Aesthetic aids to worship are crutches which keep a lame soul lame all its days.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such worship is the obligation as well as the prerogative of the Christian. We have no right to say that we have truly forsaken confidence in ourselves, and are truly ‘glorying’ in Christ Jesus, unless our daily life is communion with God, and all your work ‘worshipping by the Spirit of God.’ Such communion and worship are possible for those, and for those only, who have ‘no confidence in the flesh’ and who ‘glory in Christ Jesus.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/philippians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

The condemnation of the errors of the Judaizers, which the apostle was about to write in this chapter, he had already written in his epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians. But as they were matters of great importance, he did not grudge to write them in this letter; because, if they were only communicated to them verbally, by Epaphroditus, or others, all the Philippians might not have had an opportunity of hearing them, or they might have misunderstood them. Whereas, having them in writing, they could examine them at their leisure, and have recourse to them as often as they had occasion. St. Paul, we may observe further, wrote most of his epistles, partly at least, with a view to confute the erroneous doctrines and practices of the Judaizing teachers, who in the first age greatly disturbed the churches chiefly by their affirming, that unless the Gentiles were <span class="ital">circumcised, after the manner of Moses, they could not be saved </span>— But as these teachers artfully suited their arguments to the circumstances and prejudices of the persons whom they addressed, the controversy hath a new aspect in almost every epistle. And what the apostle advances in confutation of their doctrine, and for explaining and establishing the genuine doctrines of the gospel, comprehends a variety of particulars highly worthy of the attention of Christians in every age.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Sincere Christians rejoice in Christ Jesus. The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord - That is, in the Lord Jesus; see <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; compare the <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a> note, and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a> note. The idea here is, that it is the duty of Christians to rejoice in the Lord Jesus Christ. This duty implies the following things:<p>(1) They should rejoice that they have such a Saviour. People everywhere have felt the need of a Saviour, and to us it should be a subject of unfeigned joy that one has been provided for us. When we think of our sins, we may now rejoice that there is one who can deliver us from them; when we think of the worth of the soul, we may rejoice that there is one who can save it from death; when we think of our danger, we can rejoice that there is one who can rescue us from all peril, and bring us to a world where we shall be for ever safe.<p>(2) we may rejoice that we have such a Saviour. He is just such as we need. He accomplishes just what we want a Saviour to do. We need one to make known to us a way of pardon, and he does it. We need one to make an atonement for sin, and he does it. We need one to give us peace from a troubled conscience, and he does it. We need one to support us in trials and bereavements, and he does it. We need one who can comfort us on the bed of death, and guide us through the dark valley, and the Lord Jesus is just what we want. When we look at his character, it is just such as it should be to win our hearts, and to make us love him; and when we look at what he has done, we see that he has accomplished all that we can desire, and why should we not rejoice?<p>(3) we may and should rejoice in him. The principal joy of the true Christian should be in the Lord. He should find his happiness not in riches, or gaiety, or vanity, or ambition, or books, or in the world in any form, but in communion with the Lord Jesus, and in the hope of eternal life through him. In his friendship, and in his service, should be the highest of our joys, and in these we may always be happy. It is the privilege, therefore, of a Christian to rejoice. He has more sources of joy than any other man - sources which do not fail when all others fail. Religion is not sadness or melancholy, it is joy; and the Christian should never leave the impression on others that his religion makes him either gloomy or morose. A cheerful countenance, an eye of benignity, a conversation pleasant and kind, should always evince the joy of his heart, and in all his contact with the world around hint he should show that his heart is full of joy.<p>To write the same things - That is, to repeat the same truths and admonitions. Perhaps he refers in this to the exhortations which he had given them when he was with them, on the same topics on which he is now writing to them. He says, that for him to record these exhortations, and transmit them by a letter, might be the means of permanent welfare to them, and would not be burdensome or oppressive to him. It was not absolutely necessary for them, but still it would be conducive to their order and comfort as a church. We may suppose that this chapter is a summary of what he had often inculcated when he was with them.<p>To me indeed is not grievous - It is not burdensome or oppressive to me to repeat these exhortations in this manner. They might suppose that in the multitude of cares which he had, and in his trials in Rome, it might be too great a burden for him to bestow so much attention on their interests.<p>But for you it is safe - It will contribute to your security as Christians, to have these sentiments and admonitions on record. They were exposed to dangers which made them proper. What those dangers were, the apostle specifies in the following verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Php 3:1-21.

The Syriac version reads, "in our Lord", i.e. Christ. The apostle seems as if he was about to conclude his epistle; and therefore, as if he was taking his farewell of this church, and giving his last advice to them, he exhorts them in a most affectionate manner, as his dear brethren in a spiritual relation, that they would make Christ their chief joy; that whatever sorrow they might have on account of his bonds, or the sickness of Epaphroditus, yet, he observes they had reason to rejoice in their Lord and Saviour; and however, it might be matter of rejoicing to them to hear of his hope of coming once more to them, and of the recovery of their minister and his return to them, yet Christ should be the principal object of their joy. A believer has always reason to rejoice in Christ; in the greatness of his person, he being in the form of God, and equal to him, and therefore able to save his to the uttermost by his obedience and death, and has interest enough in heaven to make his intercession prevalent and successful and power to keep safe all that are committed to him; and in the fitness of his person to be a Mediator, and daysman, to take care of things pertaining to the glory of God, and to make reconciliation for sin; and in the fulness of his person, he having all grace in him for his people, which is all theirs, and with joy may they draw water out of the full wells of salvation in him; and in the beauty of his person which surpasses all others, a sight of which fills with joy unspeakable, and full of glory. They may, and should rejoice, as they sometimes do, in his salvation; in the contrivance of it by infinite wisdom; in the impetration of it by himself; and in the application of it by his spirit; and that because hereby justice is satisfied, the law is magnified and made honourable, sin is finished, and an everlasting righteousness brought in. Also they are called upon to rejoice in his resurrection, which is for their justification; in his ascension, seeing he then received gifts for men; and in his session at the right hand of God, which is in their nature; and in his intercession which is to their advantage; and in all the relations he stands in to them, as head, husband, father, brother, friend; and in everything that is his, and that belongs unto him, as his Gospel, ordinances, ways, and worship, <p>To write the same things to you. The apostle finding he had more time on his hands, or fresh thoughts occurred to him, writes on, and makes an apology for writing the same things, which he had either wrote to other churches, or which he had delivered when first among them, or which he had since wrote to them. For sometimes it is necessary to say and write the same things over and over again, partly that they may be the better understood, and partly that they may be more strongly fixed in the memory; as also, that the saints may be the more established in the present truth: and which he says, <p>to me indeed is not grievous; or troublesome; he found no backwardness to it, nor sluggishness in it; he was not loath to do it, nor was it wearisome to him; or made him slothful, as the Arabic renders it; nor was he afraid to repeat what he had wrote, or again to warn them against false teachers, of whom he stood in no fear: <p>but for you it is safe; or "necessary", as the Vulgate Latin version reads, being a means of preserving them from the error of the wicked; for though the saints are safe in Christ, and can never finally and totally be deceived, yet the Gospel, and the frequent ministration of it, are a means of keeping them from the deception of evil men; for as the Syriac version renders it, "they make you more cautious"; when truth is repeated, and afresh confirmed, it guards against falling in with damnable heresies. And so the Arabic version renders it, "is a guard", or "garrison to you". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/philippians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Finally, <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> To write the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> same things to you, to me indeed <i>is</i> not grievous, but for you <i>it is</i> safe.</span><p>(1) A conclusion of those things which have been said before, that is, that they go forward cheerfully in the Lord.<p>(2) A preface to the next admonition that follows, to take good heed and beware of false apostles, who join circumcision with Christ, (that is to say, justification by works, with free justification by faith), and beat into men's head the ceremonies which are abolished, instead of true exercises of godliness and charity.

This is contrary to the view of Schinz and van Hengel, who, from the fact that Paul has not yet expressed his thanks, conclude that he did not at this point desire to proceed to the closing of the letter. We need not search for a connection with what precedes (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">ἔχετε Ἐπαφρόδιτον</span>, <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὃν ἠλγεῖτε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔχετε Τιμόθεον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔρχομαι κἀγώ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἐπιδίδωσι</span>· <span class="greekheb">τί ὑμῖν λείπει λοιπόν</span>; comp.

The preceding topic is <span class="ital">closed</span>, and the exhortation beginning with <span class="greekheb">τὸ λοιπ</span>. which now follows stands by itself; so that we are not even justified in saying that Paul here passes from <span class="ital">the particular to the general</span> (Schinz, Matthies), but must simply assume that he is proceeding to <span class="ital">the conclusion</span>, which he desired to commence with this general encouragement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">χαίρετε ἐν κυρίῳ</span>] is a summons to <span class="ital">Christian</span> joyfulness, which is not <span class="greekheb">κατὰ κόσμον</span> (see Chrysostom), but has its ground <span class="ital">in Christ</span>, and is thereby specifically defined, inasmuch as Christ—through the Holy Spirit—rules in the believing heart; hence the <span class="greekheb">χαρὰ πνεύματος ἁγίου</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>) or <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ</span> (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>) are in substance not different from this (comp. <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>). The subsequent double repetition of this encouragement (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm" title="Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.">Php 4:4</a>) is the result of the apostle’s special love for his readers, and of the whole tone of feeling pervading the epistle.

This view is at variance, not indeed with the plural <span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span> (see, on the contrary, Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat. Apol</span>. p. 19 D; Mätzner, <span class="ital">ad Antiph</span>. p. 153; Kühner II. 1, p. 60), but with the facts, first, that there is no express summons whatever to <span class="ital">Christian joyfulness generally</span>, given in the previous portion of the epistle (not even in <a href="/philippians/2-18.htm" title="For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.">Php 2:18</a>); secondly, that so simple and natural a summons—which, moreover, occurs again twice in <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm" title="Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.">Php 4:4</a>—would certainly have least of all given rise to an apology for repetition; and lastly, that <span class="greekheb">ἀσφαλές</span>, in accordance with its idea (<span class="ital">without danger</span>), points not to the repetition of a summons <span class="ital">of this kind</span>, but to a <span class="ital">warning</span>, such as follows immediately in the context.[145] The accusation of <span class="ital">poverty of thought</span> (Baur) is therefore all the more groundless here. And as the altogether vague reference of Theodoret and Erasmus (<span class="ital">Annotat</span>.) to the <span class="ital">numerous</span> <span class="ital">exhortations contained in the epistle generally</span>, or to the <span class="ital">fundamental tone</span> of the letter hitherto (Weiss), is simply at variance with the literal import of the words, <span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span> cannot be interpreted as applicable to anything but the <span class="ital">subsequent warning against the false teachers</span>. This warning, however, has not occurred previously, either at <a href="/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a> f., or indirectly in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a>, as Lünemann thinks, or in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a> to <a href="/philippians/2-18.htm" title="For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.">Php 2:18</a>, as Ewald assumes. Hence many have caught at the explanation: “eadem repetere, <span class="ital">quae praesens dixeram</span>” (Pelagius, Theodore of Mopsuestia, so also Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>., Calvin, Beza, Balduin, Estius, Calovius, Wolf, Schrader, and others; de Wette undecidedly). But this <span class="ital">quae praesens dixeram</span> is quite gratuitously imported; it must at least have been indicated by <span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτὰ καὶ γρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. or in some other way. The same objection applies against Wieseler (<span class="ital">Chronol. d. apost. Zeitalt</span>. p. 458 f.), who takes <span class="greekheb">τὰ αὐτά</span> as contrasted with the oral communications, which would be made to the readers <span class="ital">by Epaphroditus</span> and especially by <span class="ital">Timothy</span>. The only correct explanation, therefore, that remains is the assumption (which, however, is expressly rejected already by Theodoret) that Paul had already written what follows <span class="ital">in an earlier epistle to the Philippians</span> [146] which is not preserved, and that he here repeats the same. So Aegidius Hunnius, Haenlein, Bertholdt, Flatt, Köhler, in the <span class="ital">Annal. d. ges. Theol</span>. 1834, III. 1, p. 18 f.; Feilmoser, Bleek, Jatho, Schenkel, Bisping, Hilgenfeld, Hofmann; de Wette undecidedly. It must remain uncertain, however, whether this repetition covers <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a> only, or <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a> also, or a still larger portion of the sequel; as also, how far the repetition is a <span class="ital">literal</span> one, which seems to be the case with <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a> from its peculiar character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὀκνηρόν</span>] <span class="ital">irksome, matter of scruple</span> (Dem. 777. 5; Theocr. xxiv. 35; Pind. <span class="ital">Nem</span>. xi. 28; Herodian vi. 9, 7; Soph. <span class="ital">O.

It is true that the <span class="ital">plur</span>. in this passage (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιστολὰς</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἅς</span>) is usually explained as referring to <span class="ital">one</span> epistle (see Cotelerius <span class="ital">in loc.;</span> and Fabricius, <span class="ital">Cod. Apocr</span>. II. p. 914 f.; Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Apost. Väter</span>, p. 210; J. B. Lightfoot, p. 138 f.), just as it is well known that also in profane authors <span class="greekheb">ἑπιστολαί</span> (comp. <span class="ital">literae</span>) is used of <span class="ital">one</span> despatch (Thuc. i. 132. 6, viii. 39. 2), sometimes generally in a <span class="ital">generic</span> sense as plural of the <span class="ital">category</span>, and sometimes specially of <span class="ital">commissions</span> and <span class="ital">orders</span>. See Schaefer, <span class="ital">Plut</span>. VI. p. 446; Blomf. and Stanl. <span class="ital">ad Aesch. Prom</span>. 3; Rettig, <span class="ital">Quaest. Phil</span>. II. p. 37 f. But there is the less ground for assuming this construction here, since <span class="ital">doctrinal epistles</span>, both in the N. T. and also in the apostolic Fathers, are always described by the <span class="ital">singular</span> when only one epistle is intended, and by the plural (as in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-3.htm" title="And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem.">1 Corinthians 16:3</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/10-9.htm" title="That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters....">2 Corinthians 10:9-11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2 Peter 3:16</a>; comp. <a href="/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="/acts/22-5.htm" title="As also the high priest does bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound to Jerusalem, for to be punished.">Acts 22:5</a>) if more than one are meant,—a practice from which there is no exception (not even in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-3.htm" title="And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem.">1 Corinthians 16:3</a>), as, in fact, Polycarp, in regard to <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστολή</span>, elsewhere very definitely distinguishes between the singular and plural. See ch. 13: <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἐπιστολὰς Ἰγνατίου τὰς πεμφθείσας ἡμῖν ὑπʼ αὑτοῦ καὶ ἄλλας ὅσας εἴχομεν παρʼ ἡμῖνʼ ἐπέμψαμεν ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἑνετείλασθε</span>· <span class="greekheb">αἵτινες ὑποτεταγμέναι εἰσὶ τῆ πιστολῇ ταύτῃ</span>. In order to prove that Polycarp in ch. 3. did not mean <span class="ital">more than one</span> epistle to the Philippians, an appeal has been made to ch. 4., where, in the Latin version, which alone has been preserved, it is said: “Ego autem nihil tale sensi in vobis vel audivi, in quibus laboravit beatus Paulus, qui estis (non-genuine addition: <span class="ital">laudati</span>) in principio <span class="ital">epistolae ejus;</span> de vobis enim gloriatur in omnibus ecclesiis, quæ Deum solae tunc cognoverant, nos autem nondum noveramus.” But <span class="ital">epistolae ejus</span> cannot here be the epistle to the Philippians, for the idea: “ye are in the beginning of his epistle,” would be simply absurd; <span class="ital">epistolae</span> is, on the contrary, the nominative plural, and the sense is: “Ye are originally <span class="ital">his epistles,</span>” that is, his <span class="ital">letters of recommendation</span>, in which phrase allusion is made to <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2 Corinthians 3:1</a> ff.[149] The correctness of this explanation, which Wieseler has substantially adopted, is corroborated by the sequel: <span class="ital">de vobis enim gloriatur</span>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is, moreover, <span class="ital">à priori</span> intelligible and likely enough that Paul should have corresponded with this church—which enjoyed his most intimate confidence, and the founding of which marked his entrance on his European labours—at an earlier period than merely now, almost at the close of his life. And Polycarp was sufficiently close to the time of the apostle, not merely to have <span class="ital">inferred</span> such a correspondence from our passage, but to have had a <span class="ital">historical knowledge</span> of it (in opposition to Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[147] Ewald also acknowledges the composition of more than one epistle to the Philippians, but finds traces of them not here, but at <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/philippians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

As a fact the Apostle is just about to open the <span class="ital">last large</span> topic of his letter, the topic of the difference between a true and a false Gospel; all else in the remaining paragraphs is only accessory. Hitherto he has been dealing, in effect, with the duty and blessedness of unity, secured by humility and watchfulness; bringing in some all-important doctrinal statements, but only by the way. He will now close with a definite and solemn message of spiritual truth, in a matter of present urgency.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The connexion of this passage has been much debated, and particularly the bearing of the phrase “to write <span class="ital">the same things</span> unto you.” What does he refer to? To a previous Epistle? To a previous similar statement in this Epistle? But there is no other hint whatever of a previous letter; and in this present letter there is no previous injunction to rejoice. The solution offered by Bp Lightfoot is as follows:—“The same things” are the <span class="ital">exhortations to unity</span> so often made already, and which the Apostle <span class="ital">was about to reinforce</span>. But he was interrupted in his work, and not till after an interval of days, perhaps, did he resume it. He then dropped the intended appeal, and turned instead to the yet more serious subject of doctrinal error.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This ingenious suggestion offers, however, a serious difficulty, by assuming that St Paul, with his scribe beside him, would have sent out an Epistle in a state so disjointed, simply for lack of revision. No view of Divine inspiration demands it; and certainly all considerations of thoughtful authorship are against it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We offer the following theory:—The Apostle sees before him, as he thinks of Philippi, the danger of doctrinal error; error which in one way or another undervalues Christ and Him crucified. The true antidote to such error is a developed and rejoicing intuition into Christ and His work, such as had been granted to himself. This he will now make his theme. But he has, in a sense, done so already, by the oft-repeated allusions to the Lord’s sovereign and vital connexion with His people (“<span class="ital">in the Lord</span>,” “<span class="ital">in the heart of Christ</span>,” &c.), and above all by the opening passages of ch. 2. So he is “writing the same things” when he writes now “finally” about “rejoicing <span class="ital">in the Lord</span>” as their righteousness, life, glory, strength, and peace. All “other Gospels” were obscurations of that great joy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus the special injunction to “<span class="ital">rejoice</span>” has regard to the past and coming context at once. In particular, it anticipates <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a> below, (“<span class="ital">glory in Christ Jesus</span>”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A suffrage in one of the Litanies of the venerable Church of the <span class="ital">Unitas Fratrum</span> (“the Moravians”) is in point here:—“<span class="ital">From the loss of our glory in Thee</span>, preserve and keep us, gracious Lord and God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">rejoice</span>] R.V. margin, “or, <span class="ital">farewell</span>.” But the evidence of <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm" title="Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.">Php 4:4</a>, which plainly takes this phrase up, and adds the word “<span class="ital">always</span>,” is altogether for the text R.V., and A.V. “Farewell <span class="ital">always</span>” is an impossible formula of conclusion; we are constrained to render “<span class="ital">Be glad</span> always” there. And already <a href="/philippians/2-18.htm" title="For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.">Php 2:18</a> he has used the same Greek word in that sense beyond doubt. See the last note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Lord</span>] See last note but one, and that on <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">To write the same</span> things] See last note but two, for a reference of this to “the things” already written in this Epistle about the glory and fulness of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to me indeed … safe</span>] The Greek words form an Iambic trimeter, a verse corresponding in the Greek drama to our blank heroic, and may thus be a quotation by the way[22].

The golden thread of spiritual joy runs through this Epistle. "Rejoice in the Lord" is the oft-repeated refrain of St. Paul's solemn hymn of praise. <span class="cmt_word">To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe</span>. "The same things:" does he refer to his oral instructions, to a previous Epistle now lost, to his exhortations to unity, or to his reiterated command "Rejoice"? The words seem most naturally to point to something in the same Epistle rather than to advice given on former occasions. It is true that Polycarp, in his letter to the Philippiaus (section 3), says that St. Paul wrote Epistles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>) to them; but there is no trace of any other Epistle; and the mere plural number is not sufficient to support the theory of other letters, the plural word being frequently used of a single letter. Bishop Lightfoot suggests the exhortation to unity in <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>. But this topic does not reappear before <a href="/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>. And the hypothesis of an interruption, which (as Bishop Lightfoot and others think) suddenly turned the apostle's thoughts into another channel and prevented him from explaining <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span> (the same things) till <a href="/philippians/4-2.htm">Philippians 4:2</a>, seems forced and unnecessary, notwithstanding the great authority by which it is supported. It seems more probable (Bengel and others) that St. Paul refers to the constant admonition of this Epistle, "Rejoice in the Lord." To repeat this again and again was to him not grievous (rather, with R.V., "irksome"), but safe for the Philippians. Christian joy has a close connection with safety, for it implies unswerving faith, and, more than that, the presence of Christ. Compare the oft-repeated exhortation of <a href="/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a>, "Fret not thyself: it tends only to evil-doing" (ver. 8, in the Hebrew). Possibly, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span> here, as in <a href="/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a> and. 25:26, may mean "certain." The repetition is not irksome to St. Paul, while it makes his meaning and his wishes certain to the Philippians. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/philippians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Finally (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., for the rest.

From &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; to delay. Hence, in classical Greek, shrinking, backward, unready. The idea of delay underlies the secondary sense, burdensome, troublesome. It is the vexation arising from weary waiting, and which appears in the middle English irken to tire or to become tired, cognate with the Latin urgere to press, and English irk, irksome, work. </body></html>
