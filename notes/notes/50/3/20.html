But both the grammatical form and the ordinary usage of the word (not elsewhere found in the New Testament) point to the former sense; which is also far better accordant with the general wording of the passage. For the word “is” is the emphatic word, which signifies “actually exists”; and the reference to the appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ is obviously suggested by the thought that with it will also come the manifestation of the “Jerusalem which is above . . . the mother of us all” (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>); as in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>, “I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from heaven.” The force of the passage would, however, in either case be much the same. “Their mind is on earth; our country is in heaven,” and to it our affections cling, even during our earthly pilgrimage. It is impossible not to remember the famous words of Plato of his <span class= "ital">Divine Republic, </span>“In heaven, perhaps, the embodiment of it is stored up for any one who wills to see it, and seeing it, to claim his place therein” (<span class= "ital">Rep.</span> ix., p. 592B). But the infinite difference between the shadowy republic of the philosopher, to which each has to rise, if he can, by his own spiritual power, and the well-centred “kingdom of God,” is suggested by the very words that follow here. The kingdom is real, because there is a real King, who has given us a place there, who will one day be manifested to take us home. It should be noted that the city is spoken of as ours already. As all the citizens of Philippi, the Roman colony, were citizens of the far distant imperial city, so the Philippian Christians even now were citizens of the better country in heaven. (See <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">We look for.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">we eagerly wait for.</span> The word is a peculiar and striking expression of longing, found also in <a href="/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/romans/8-25.htm" title="But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.">Romans 8:25</a>, “The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God” (where see Note).<p><span class= "bld">The Saviour.</span>—The title is emphatic in relation to the hope of perfected salvation which follows. But we note that the use of the word “Saviour” by St. Paul is peculiar to the later Epistles, and especially frequent in the Pastoral Epistles.

The original expression, <span class="greekheb">πολιτευμα</span>, rendered conversation, is a word of a very extensive meaning, implying our citizenship, our thoughts, our affections, are already <span class="ital">in heaven; </span>or we think, speak, and act, converse with our fellow-creatures, and conduct ourselves in all our intercourse with them, as citizens of the New Jerusalem, and as being only strangers and pilgrims upon earth. We therefore endeavour to promote the interests of that glorious society to which we belong, to learn its manners, secure a title to its privileges, and behave in a way suitable to, and worthy of our relation to it; <span class="ital">from whence also we look for the Saviour </span>— To come and carry us thither according to his promise, (<a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>,) namely, our spirits, at the dissolution of this earthly tabernacle; yea, and afterward to transform <span class="ital">our vile body, </span><span class="greekheb">το σωμα της ταπεινωσεως</span>, <span class="ital">the body of our humiliation; </span>which, in consequence of the fall of our first parents, sinks us so low, is subject to, and encompassed with, so many infirmities, is such a clog to our souls, and so greatly hinders our progress in the work of faith and labour of love: this body we expect he will transform into the most perfect state and the most beauteous form, when it will be purer than the unspotted firmament, brighter than the lustre of the stars, and, which exceeds all parallel, which comprehends all perfection, <span class="ital">like unto his glorious body </span>— Of which an image was given in his transfiguration, yea like that wonderfully glorious body which he wears in his heavenly kingdom, and on his triumphant throne. So that here, as <a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>, the redemption of the body from corruption, by a glorious resurrection, is represented as the especial privilege of the righteous. <span class="ital">According to that mighty working </span>— That energy of power; <span class="ital">whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself</span> — To show himself to the whole intelligent creation of God completely victorious over all his enemies, even over death and the grave, the last of them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For our conversation is in heaven - That is, this is true of all who are sincere Christians. It is a characteristic of Christians, in contradistinction from those who are the "enemies of the cross," that their conversation is in heaven. The word "conversation" we now apply almost entirely to oral discourse. It formerly, however, meant conduct in general, and it is usually employed in this sense in the Scriptures; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, where the verb occurs, from which the noun here is derived. The word used here - &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  politeuma - is found nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means, any public measure, administration of the state, the manner in which the affairs of a state are administered; and then the state itself, the community, commonwealth, those who are hound under the same laws, and associated in the same society. Here it cannot mean that their "conversation," in the sense of discourse or talking, was in heaven; nor that their "conduct" was in heaven - for this would convey no idea, and the original word does not demand it; but the idea is, that they were heavenly citizens, or citizens of the heavenly world, in contradistinction from a worldly community, They were governed by the laws of heaven; they were a community associated as citizens of that world, and expecting there to dwell.<p>The idea is, that there are two great communities in the universe - that of the world, and that of heaven: that governed by worldly laws and institutions, and that by the laws of heaven; that associated for worldly purposes, and that associated for heavenly or religious purposes; and that the Christian belonged to the latter - the enemy of the cross, though in the church, belonged to the former. Between true Christians, therefore, and others, there is all the difference which arises from belonging to different communities; being bound together for different purposes; subject to different laws; and altogether under a different administration. There is more difference between them than there is between the subjects of two earthly governments; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>, note 19, note.<p>From whence also we look for the Saviour - From heaven. That is, it is one of the characteristics of the Christian that he believes that the Lord Jesus will return from heaven, and that he looks and waits for it. Other men do not believe this <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>, but the Christian confidently expects it. His Saviour has been taken away from the earth, and is now in heaven, but it is a great and standing article of his faith that that same Saviour will again come, and take the believer to himself; see the <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>, note. This was the firm belief of the early Christians, and this expectation with them was allowed to exert a constant influence on their hearts and lives. It led them:<p>(1) to desire to be prepared for his coming;<p>(2) to feel that earthly affairs were of little importance, as the scene here was soon to close;<p>(3) to live above the world, and in the desire of the appearing of the Lord Jesus.<p>This was one of the elementary doctrines of their faith, and one of the means of producing deadness to the world among them; and among the early Christians there was, perhaps, no doctrine that was more the object of firm belief, and the ground of more delightful contemplation, than that their ascended Master would return. In regard to the certainty of their belief on this point, and the effect which it had on their minds, see the following texts of the New Testament; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>; <a href="/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>; <a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>; <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>. It may be asked, with great force, whether Christians in general have now any such expectation of the second appearing of the Lord Jesus, or whether they have not fallen into the dangerous error of prevailing unbelief, so that the expectation of his coming is allowed to exert almost no influence on the soul.<p>In the passage before us, Paul says that it was one of the distinct characteristics of Christians that they looked for the coming of the Saviour from heaven. They believed that he would return. They anticipated that important effects would follow to them from his second coming. So we should look. There may be, indeed, a difference of opinion about the time when he will come, and about the question whether he will come to reign "literally, on the earth - but the fact that Christ will return to our world is common ground on which all Christians may meet, and is a fact which should be allowed to exert its full influence on the heart. It is a glorious truth - for what a sad world would this be, and what a sad prospect would be before the Christian, if the Saviour were never to come to raise his people from their graves, and to gather his redeemed to himself! The fact that he will come is identified with all our hopes. It is fitted to cheer us in trial; to guard us in temptation; to make us dead to the world; to lead us to keep the eye turned toward heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. our conversation&#8212;rather, "our state" or "country"; our citizenship: our life as citizens.

So Luther (who up till 1528 rendered it “citizenship”), Castalio, Erasmus, Calvin, Grotius, and many others, including Matthies, van Hengel, de Wette; while Rheinwald mixes up interpretations of various kinds. This rendering is not justified by linguistic usage, which indeed vouches for <span class="greekheb">πολιτεύεσθαι</span> (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a>) in this sense, and for <span class="greekheb">πολιτεία</span> (Clem. <span class="ital">Cor</span>.

But the Greek in all these places is quite different from the Greek here, where the word is <span class="ital">polîteuma</span>. (connected with <span class="ital">polis</span>, city, <span class="ital">polîtês</span>, citizen), a word which occurs nowhere else in N.T., nor in LXX., nor in the Apocrypha. In classical Greek it denotes (<span class="ital">a</span>) a “<span class="ital">measure</span>,” or “<span class="ital">policy</span>,” of state; (<span class="ital">b</span>) the <span class="ital">governing body</span> of a state, its “<span class="ital">government</span>”; (<span class="ital">c</span>) the <span class="ital">constitution</span> of a state, including the rights of its citizens. On the whole, this last meaning best suits the present context, or at least approaches it most nearly. What the Apostle means is that Christians are citizens of the heavenly City, enrolled on its register, free of its privileges, and, on the other hand, “obliged by the nobility” of such a position to live, whether in the City or not as yet, as those who belong to it and represent it. “Our citizenship, our civic <span class="ital">status</span>, is in heaven,” fairly gives this thought. In the anonymous <span class="ital">Epistle to Diognetus</span>, a Christian writing of cent. 2 (printed with the works of St Justin), a sentence occurs (c. 5) which well illustrates this passage, and perhaps refers to it, and is in itself nobly true: “Christians, as dwellers, are on earth, as citizens, in heaven.”—The verb cognate to the noun here is used there; see, on the verb, note on <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a> above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is</span>] More strictly and fully, <span class="bld">subsists</span>. See second note on <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a> above, where the same word occurs. The thought is that the “citizenship” is at any moment an antecedent and abiding fact, on which the citizen may fall back.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in heaven</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">in (the) heavens</span>; as often in N.T. On this plural see note on <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>, in this Series.—Cp. <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm" title="Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.">Revelation 3:12</a> (where see Abp Trench’s full note, <span class="ital">Epistles to the Seven Churches</span>, pp. 183–187), xxi., xxii., for the revealed conception of the heavenly City, the <span class="ital">Ourănopolis</span>, as it is finely called by St Clement of Alexandria (cent. 2), and Eusebius of Cæsarea (cent. 4); and other Greek Fathers use the word <span class="ital">ouranopolîtês</span> of the Christian.—The great treatise of St Augustine (cent. 4–5), <span class="ital">On the City (Civilas) of God</span>, contains a wealth of illustration of the idea of this verse. To Augustine, writing amidst the wreck of Old Rome (about a.d. 420), the Christian appears as citizen of a State which is the antithesis not of human order, which is of God, and which is promoted by the true citizens of heaven, but of “the world,” which is at enmity with Him. This State, or City, is now existing and operating, through its members, but not to be consummated and fully revealed till the eternity of glory shall come in (see Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. of Christian Biography</span>, 1., p. 221). The thought of the Holy City was dear to St Augustine. The noble medieval lines,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Me receptet Syon illa</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Urbs beata, urbs tranquilla</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(quoted at the close of Longfellow’s <span class="ital">Golden Legend</span>), are taken almost verbally from Augustine, <span class="ital">de Spiritu et Animâ</span>, c. lx. See Trench, <span class="ital">Sacred Latin Poetry</span>, p. 332 (and cp. pp. 312–320).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from whence</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">out of which</span> (<span class="ital">place</span>).” The pronoun is singular, and so cannot refer directly to the plural noun, “<span class="ital">the heavens</span>.” The construction must be either (<span class="ital">a</span>) a merely adverbial one, an equivalent for the adverb “<span class="ital">whence</span>”; or (<span class="ital">b</span>) the pronoun must refer back to the noun <span class="ital">politeuma</span> (on which see above). In the latter case, we must suppose that the idea of <span class="ital">citizenship</span> suggests, and passes into, that of <span class="ital">city</span>, the local home of the citizens, and the word denoting citizenship is treated <span class="ital">as if</span> it denoted city[24]. The solution (<span class="ital">a</span>) is no doubt simpler, but clear evidence for the usage (where ideas of <span class="ital">place</span> are in view), is not apparent, though the fact is asserted (e.g. by Winer, <span class="ital">Grammar of N. T. Greek</span>, Moulton’s Ed., p. 177).

The A.V. is by no means untenable grammatically, but the word “Saviour” is so placed as to suggest not only emphasis but predicative force. And the deep connexion in the N.T. between the Lord’s Return and the full and final “salvation” of the believer’s being (cp. esp. <a href="/romans/13-11.htm" title="And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.">Romans 13:11</a>) gives a natural fitness to this use of the holy Title here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">“The Lord Jesus Christ”:</span>—this full designation of the Blessed Person suits the tone of solemn hope and joy in the passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/philippians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">our</span>) whom you have as a type or example [<a href="/philippians/3-17.htm" title="Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.">Php 3:17</a>].—<span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) This gives the reason why the Philippians ought to imitate them.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ πολίτευμα</span>) <span class="ital">the community, country, city</span>, or <span class="ital">state:</span> for <span class="greekheb">ὑπάρχει</span>, <span class="ital">has its existence</span>, follows.

The word "our" is emphatic; the apostle refers back to ver. 17: "Follow us, not those enemies of the cross; <span class="accented">our</span> conversation is in heaven; <span class="accented">they</span> mind earthly things." The A.V. has this same word "conversation" in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, where the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) is the verb corresponding with the noun (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x39c;&#x3b1;</span>) which occurs here. The verb is used in the sense of a certain mode of life or conversation, as in <a href="/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>, but it does not appear that the noun ever bears that meaning. The rendering" citizenship" also seems deficient in authority.

Rev., citizenship, commonwealth in margin. The rendering conversation, in the sense of manner of life (see on <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15</a>), has no sufficient warrant; and that &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; commonwealth, is used interchangeably with &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; citizenship, is not beyond question. Commonwealth gives a good and consistent sense. The state of which we are citizens is in heaven. See on <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>. Compare Plato: "That city of which we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth. In Heaven, I replied, there is laid up the pattern of it methinks, which he who desires may behold, and beholding may settle himself there" ("Republic," 592).<p>Is in heaven (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>The use of this word instead of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; is is peculiar.

The word is habitually used in the New Testament with reference to a future manifestation of the glory of Christ or of His people.<p>The Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;)<p>Savior has no article, and its emphatic position in the sentence indicates that it is to be taken predicatively with Jesus Christ, and not as the direct object of the verb. Hence render: we await as Savior the Lord, etc. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>, "To them that wait for Him will He appear a second time unto salvation." </body></html>
