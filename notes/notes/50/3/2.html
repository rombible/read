The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beware of dogs - Dogs in the east are mostly without masters; they wander at large in the streets and fields, and feed upon offals, and even upon corpses; compare <a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-4.htm">1 Kings 16:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>. They are held as unclean, and to call one a dog is a much stronger expression of contempt there than with us; <a href="/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm">2 Kings 8:13</a>. The Jews called the pagan dogs, and the Muslims call Jews and Christians by the same name. The term dog also is used to denote a person that is shameless, impudent, malignant, snarling, dissatisfied, and contentious, and is evidently so employed here. It is possible that the language used here may have been derived from some custom of affixing a caution, on a house that was guarded by a dog, to persons approaching it. Lenfant remarks that at Rome it was common for a dog to lie chained before the door of a house, and that a notice was placed in sight, "Beware of the dog." The same notice I have seen in this city affixed to the kennel of dogs in front of a bank, that were appointed to guard it. The reference here is, doubtless, to Judaizing teachers, and the idea is, that they were contentious, troublesome, dissatisfied, and would produce disturbance. The strong language which the apostle uses here, shows the sense which he had of the danger arising from their influence. It may be observed, however, that the term dogs is used in ancient writings with great frequency, and even by the most grave speakers. It is employed by the most dignified characters in the Iliad (Boomfield), and the name was given to a whole class of Greek philosophers - the Cynics. It is used in one instance by the Saviour; <a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>. By the use of the term here, there can be no doubt that the apostle meant to express strong disapprobation of the character and course of the persons referred to, and to warn the Philippians in the most solemn manner against them.<p>Beware of evil workers - Referring, doubtless, to the same persons that he had characterized as dogs The reference is to Jewish teachers, whose doctrines and influence he regarded only as evil We do not know what was the nature of their teaching, but we may presume that it consisted much in urging the obligations of the Jewish rites and ceremonies; in speaking of the advantage of having been born Jews: and in urging a compliance with the law in order to justification before God. In this way their teachings tended to set aside the great doctrine of salvation by the merits of the Redeemer.<p>Beware of the concision - Referring, doubtless, also to the Jewish teachers. The word rendered "concision" - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;  katatome&#772; - means properly a cutting off, a mutilation. It is used here contemptuously for the Jewish circumcision in contrast with the true circumcision. Robinson, Lexicon. It is not to be understood that Paul meant to throw contempt on circumcision as enjoined by God, and as practiced by the pious Jews of other times (compare <a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>), but only as it was held by the false Judaizing teachers. As they held it, it was not the true circumcision. They made salvation to depend on it, instead of its being only a sign of the covenant with God. Such a doctrine, as they held it, was a mere cutting off of the flesh, without understanding anything of the true nature of the rite, and, hence, the unusual term by which he designates it. Perhaps, also, there may be included the idea that a doctrine so held would be in fact a cutting off of the soul; that is, that it tended to destruction. Their cutting and mangling the flesh might be regarded as an emblem of the manner in which their doctrine would cut and mangle the church - Doddridge. The meaning of the whole is, that they did not understand the true nature of the doctrine of circumcision, but that with them it was a mere cutting of the flesh, and tended to destroy the church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Beware&#8212;Greek, "Have your eye on" so as to beware of. Contrast "mark," or "observe," namely, so as to follow Php 3:17.<p>dogs&#8212;Greek, "the dogs," namely, those impure persons "of whom I have told you often" (Php 3:18, 19); "the abominable" (compare Re 21:8, with Re 22:15; Mt 7:6; Tit 1:15, 16): "dogs" in filthiness, unchastity, and snarling (De 23:18; Ps 59:6, 14, 15; 2Pe 2:22): especially "enemies of the cross of Christ" (Php 3:18; Ps 22:16, 20). The Jews regarded the Gentiles as "dogs" (Mt 15:26); but by their own unbelief they have ceased to be the true Israel, and are become "dogs" (compare Isa 56:10, 11).<p>evil workers&#8212;(2Co 11:13), "deceitful workers." Not simply "evildoers" are meant, but men who "worked," indeed, ostensibly for the Gospel, but worked for evil: "serving not our Lord, but their own belly" (Php 3:19; compare Ro 16:18). Translate, "The evil workmen," that is, bad teachers (compare 2Ti 2:15).<p>concision&#8212;Circumcision had now lost its spiritual significance, and was now become to those who rested on it as any ground of justification, a senseless mutilation. Christians have the only true circumcision, namely, that of the heart; legalists have only "concision," that is, the cutting off of the flesh. To make "cuttings in the flesh" was expressly prohibited by the law (Le 21:5): it was a Gentile-heathenish practice (1Ki 18:28); yet this, writes Paul indignantly, is what these legalists are virtually doing in violation of the law. There is a remarkable gradation, says Birks [Hor&aelig; Apostolic&aelig;] in Paul's language as to circumcision. In his first recorded discourse (Ac 13:39), circumcision is not named, but implied as included in the law of Moses which cannot justify. Six or seven years later, in the Epistle to Galatians (Ga 3:3), the first Epistle in which it is named, its spiritual inefficiency is maintained against those Gentiles who, beginning in the Spirit, thought to be perfected in the flesh. Later, in Epistle to Romans (Ro 2:28, 29), he goes farther, and claims the substance of it for every believer, assigning the shadow only of it to the unbelieving Jew. In Epistle to Colossians (Col 2:11; 3:11), still later, he expounds more fully the true circumcision as the exclusive privilege of the believer. Last of all here, the very name is denied to the legalist, and a term of reproach is substituted, "concision," or flesh-cutting. Once obligatory on all the covenant-people, then reduced to a mere national distinction, it was more and more associated in the apostle's experience with the open hostility of the Jews, and the perverse teaching of false brethren.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Beware; </span> he cautions all, both officers and people: and though the original word doth signify to look with mind and eye, yet it is also frequently rendered, to take heed, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/8-15.htm" title="And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.">Mark 8:15</a> 12:38 8:9,23,33 <a href="/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1 Corinthians 16:10</a> <a href="/2_john/1-8.htm" title="Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have worked, but that we receive a full reward.">2Jo 1:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of dogs; </span> of those dogs, (with the article emphatically proposed), a metaphor borrowed from those voracious, fierce, impure animals, whose price was not brought into the Lord’s house, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm" title="You shall not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both these are abomination to the LORD your God.">Deu 23:18</a> <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm" title="As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.">Proverbs 26:11</a> <a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm" title="He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol.

Chrysostom, Oecumenius, and Theophylact justly lay stress on the <span class="ital">abolition of the legal circumcision as such</span> brought about through Christ (the end of the law, <a href="/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>),—a presupposition which gives to this antinomistic sarcasm its warrant.[150] A description of <span class="ital">idolatry</span>, with allusion to <a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm" title="They shall not make baldness on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.">Leviticus 21:5</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm" title="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.">1 Kings 18:28</a>, <span class="ital">et al</span>.

The passage quoted by him from Philostr., <span class="ital">Vit. Soph</span>. <a href="/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,">Php 2:1</a>, does not bear upon the point, because in it the three repetitions of <span class="greekheb">ἔβλεψε</span> are divided by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῈΝ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΔΈ</span></span></span>. Weiss also refers the three designations to three different categories, namely: (1) the unconverted <span class="ital">heathen</span>, with their immoral life; (2) the self-seeking <span class="ital">Christian</span> teachers, <a href="/context/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:...">Php 1:15-17</a>; and (3) the <span class="ital">unbelieving</span> <span class="ital">Jews</span>, with their carnal conceit. But the first and third categories introduce alien elements, and the third cannot be identified with those mentioned at <a href="/context/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:...">Php 1:15-17</a>, but must mean persons much more dangerous. In opposition to the whole misinterpretation, see Huther in the <span class="ital">Mecklenb. Zeitschr</span>. p. 626 ff. All the <span class="ital">three</span> terms must characterize <span class="ital">one</span> class of men as in three aspects deserving of detestation, namely the <span class="ital">Judaizing false teachers</span>. As is evident from <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κατατομήν</span> and <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a> ff., they belonged to the same fundamentally hostile party against which Paul contends in the Epistle to the Galatians. At the same time, since the threefold repetition of the article pointing them out may be founded upon the very <span class="ital">notoriety</span> of these men, and yet does not of necessity presuppose a <span class="ital">personal</span> acquaintance with them, it must be left an open question, whether they had already come to Philippi itself, or merely threatened danger from some place in its vicinity. It is certain, however, though Baur still regards it as doubtful, that Paul did not refer to his opponents <span class="ital">in Rome</span> mentioned in <a href="/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a> ff. (Heinrichs), because in the passage before us a line of teaching must be thought of which was expressly and in principle anti-Pauline, leading back into Judaism and to legal righteousness; and also because the earnest, demonstrative <span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span>, as well as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΣΦΑΛΈς</span></span></span> (<a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a>), can only indicate a danger which was visibly and closely threatening the readers. It is also certain that these opponents could not as yet have succeeded in finding adherents among the Philippians; for if this had been the case, Paul would not have omitted to censure the readers themselves (as in the Epistle to the Galatians and Second Corinthians), and he would have given a very different shape generally to his epistle, which betrays nothing but a church as yet undivided in doctrine. His language directed against the false teachers is therefore merely <span class="ital">warning</span> and <span class="ital">precautionary</span>, as is also shown in <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[150] Luther’s works abound in sarcastic <span class="ital">paronomasiae.</span> Thus, for instance, in the preface to his works, instead of <span class="ital">De</span> cret and <span class="ital">De</span> cretal, he has written “<span class="ital">Dre</span>cket” and “<span class="ital">Dre</span>cketal” [Germ.

To surrender to their teaching was really to renounce the most precious gift of the Gospel, namely, “the glorious liberty of the sons of God”. For, in Paul’s view, he who possesses the Spirit is raised above all law. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>, and see Gunkcl, <span class="ital">Wirkungen</span>2, etc., pp. 96–98.—<span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span>. Thrice repeated in the intense energy of his invective. Literally = “look at” them, in the sense of “beware of” them. It is not so used in classical Greek. Apparently some such significance as this is found in <a href="/2_chronicles/10-16.htm" title="And when all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to your own house.

He would have used a stronger word than <span class="greekheb">βλ</span>. had the Judaisers already made some progress at Philippi. There is nothing to suggest this in the Epistle. But all the Pauline Churches were exposed to their inroads. At any moment their emissaries might appear.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς κύνας</span>. Only here in Paul. Commentators have tried to single out the point of comparison intended, some emphasising the <span class="ital">shamelessness</span> of dogs, others their <span class="ital">impurity</span>, others their <span class="ital">roaming tendencies</span>, others still their <span class="ital">insolence</span> and <span class="ital">cunning</span>. Most probably the Apostle had no definite characteristic in his mind. <span class="greekheb">κύων</span> was a term of reproach in Greek from the earliest to the latest times. <span class="ital">E.g.</span>, Hom., <span class="ital">Il.</span>, xiii., 623.

We have here clear evidence that the persons alluded to were within the Christian Church. They did professedly carry on the work of the Gospel, but with a false aim. This invalidates the arguments of Lips[23]., Hltzm[24]. and M‘Giffert (<span class="ital">Apost.

A scornful parody of their much-vaunted <span class="greekheb">περιτομή</span>. W-M[25]. (pp. 794–796) gives numerous exx. of a similar paronomasia, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Diog.

He refers to a known and defined class; and these evidently were those Judaistic teachers within the pale of the Church to whom he has referred already (<a href="/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a>) in another connexion and in a different tone. These Pharisee-Christians very probably called the uncircumcised, and (from their point of view) non-conforming, converts, “dogs,” as the Pharisees-proper called all Gentiles; cp. <a href="/context/matthew/15-26.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs....">Matthew 15:26-27</a>, for words alluding to this use of the term. The habits and instincts of the dog suggest ideas of uncleanness and wantonness; and its half-wild condition in Eastern towns adds the idea of a thing outcast. Thus everywhere in Scripture the word “dog” is used in connexions of contempt, reproach or dread: see e.g. <a href="/1_samuel/24-14.htm" title="After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.">1 Samuel 24:14</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-9.htm" title="Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head.">2 Samuel 16:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm" title="And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?

The same view is expressed more fully <a href="/context/galatians/5-2.htm" title="Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing....">Galatians 5:2-4</a>.—It is just possible that the word “dog” refers also to positive immorality underlying, in many cases, a rigid ceremonialism. But this is at most secondary here. See below <a href="/context/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:...">Php 3:18-19</a>, and notes, for another “school” more open to such charges.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">evil workers</span>] Better, <span class="bld">the bad work-men</span>. He refers to the same faction under another aspect. Very probably, by a play on the word “worker,” he censures them as teaching a salvation by “works,” not by faith. (See e.g. <a href="/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.">Romans 3:27</a>; <a href="/romans/4-2.htm" title="For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God.">Romans 4:2</a>; <a href="/romans/4-6.htm" title="Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,">Romans 4:6</a>; <a href="/romans/11-6.htm" title="And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.

As if to say, “They are all for <span class="ital">working</span>, with a view to merit; but they are bungling <span class="ital">workmen</span> all the while, adjusting wrongly the fabric of the Gospel, and working not rightly even what in itself is right.” Cp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:13</a> for a passage where the same double meaning seems to attach to this word.—For the other side of the truth of “working” see <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a>, and notes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the concision</span>] “<span class="ital">The gashing, the mutilation</span>.” By this harsh kindred word he satirizes, as it were, the rigid zeal of the Judaist for bodily <span class="ital">circumcision</span>. In the light of the Gospel, the demand for the continuance of circumcision in the Church, as a saving ordinance, was in fact a demand for a maltreatment of the body, akin only to heathen practices; cp. e.g. <a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm" title="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.">1 Kings 18:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Cp. <a href="/galatians/5-12.htm" title="I would they were even cut off which trouble you.">Galatians 5:12</a>, with Lightfoot’s notes, for a somewhat similar use of words in a kindred connexion.

The connection is, as given in ver. 3, Rejoice in the Lord, not in the flesh; have confidence in him, not in the ceremonies of the Jewish Law. Compare the same contrast in <a href="/galatians/6-13.htm">Galatians 6:13, 14</a>. There is certainly something abrupt in the sudden introduction of this polemic against Judaizing, especially in writing to Philippi, where there were not many Jews. But there may have been circumstances, unknown to us, which made the warning necessary; or, as some think, the apostle may have written this under excitement caused by the violent opposition of the Jewish faction at Rome. <span class="accented">Beware</span>; literally, <span class="accented">mark</span>, observe them, to be on your guard against them. The <span class="accented">dogs.</span> The article must be retained in the translation. The Jews called the Gentiles "dogs" (comp. <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26, 27</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unclean, mainly because of their disregard of the distinction between clean and unclean food.

The Judaizers were active enough, like the Pharisees who "compassed sea and land to make one proselyte;" but their activity sprang from bad motives - they were evil workers, though their work was sometimes overruled for good (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15-18</a>). <span class="accented">The concision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, cutting, mutilation); a contemptuous word for "circumcision" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>). Compare the Jewish contemptuous use of Isbosheth, man of shame, for Eshbaal, man of Baal, etc. Their circumcision is no better than a mutilation.

These were nominally Christians who accepted Jesus as the Messiah, but as the Savior of Israel only. They insisted that Christ's kingdom could be entered only through the gate of Judaism. Only circumcised converts were fully accepted by God. They appeared quite early in the history of the Church, and are those referred to in <a href="/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>. Paul was the object of their special hatred and abuse. They challenged his birth, his authority, and his motives. "'Paul must be destroyed,' was as truly their watchword as the cry for the destruction of Carthage had been of old to the Roman senator" (Stanley, "Sermons and Lectures on the Apostolic Age"). These are referred to in <a href="/philippians/1-16.htm">Philippians 1:16</a>; and the whole passage in the present chapter, from <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a> to <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11</a>, is worthy of study, being full of incidental hints lurking in single words, and not always apparent in our versions; hints which, while they illustrate the main point of the discussion, are also aimed at the assertions of the Judaizers. Dogs was a term of reproach among both Greeks and Jews. Homer uses it of both women and men, implying shamelessness in the one, and recklessness in the other. Thus Helen: "Brother-in-law of me, a mischief devising dog" ("Iliad," vi., 344). Teucer of Hector: "I cannot hit this raging dog" ("Iliad," viii., 298). Dr. Thomson says of the dogs in oriental towns: "They lie about the streets in such numbers as to render it difficult and often dangerous to pick one's way over and amongst them - a lean, hungry, and sinister brood. They have no owners, but upon some principle known only to themselves, they combine into gangs, each of which assumes jurisdiction over a particular street; and they attack with the utmost ferocity all canine intruders into their territory. In those contests, and especially during the night, they keep up an incessant barking and howling, such as is rarely heard in any European city. The imprecations of David upon his enemies derive their significance, therefore, from this reference to one of the most odious of oriental annoyances" ("Land and Book," Central palestine and Phoenicia, 593). See <a href="/psalms/59-6.htm">Psalm 59:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>. Being unclean animals, dogs were used to denote what was unholy or profane. So <a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>. The Israelites are forbidden in Deuteronomy to bring the price of a dog into the house of God for any vow: <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>. The Gentiles of the Christian era were denominated "dogs" by the Jews, see <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>.

The kindred verb occurs in the Septuagint only, of mutilations forbidden by the Mosaic law. See <a href="/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>. The noun here is a play upon &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; circumcision. It means mutilation. Paul bitterly characterizes those who were not of the true circumcision (<a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28</a>, <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>) as merely mutilated. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/5-12.htm">Galatians 5:12</a>, where he uses &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to cut off, of those who would impose circumcision upon the Christian converts: "I would they would cut themselves off who trouble you;" that is, not merely circumcise, but mutilate themselves like the priests of Cybele. </body></html>
