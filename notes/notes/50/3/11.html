The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If by any means - Implying, that he meant to make use of the most strenuous exertions to obtain the object.<p>I might attain unto - I may come to, or may secure this object.<p>The resurrection of the dead - Paul believed that all the dead would be raised <a href="/acts/24-15.htm">Acts 24:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/26-6.htm">Acts 26:6-8</a>; and in this respect he would certainly attain to the resurrection of the dead, in common with all mankind. But the phrase, "the resurrection of the dead," also might be used, in a more limited sense, to denote the resurrection of the righteous as a most desirable object; and this might be secured by effort. It was this which Paul sought - this for which he strove - this that was so bright an object in his eye that it was to be secured at any sacrifice. To rise with the saints; to enter with them into the blessedness of the heavenly inheritance, was an object that the apostle thought was worth every effort which could he made.

The Greek word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. "The power of Christ's resurrection" (Ro 1:4), ensures the believer's attainment of the "resurrection from the (rest of the) dead" (compare Php 3:20, 21).

Here the clause is almost equivalent to an indirect question. The Resurrection is the Apostle’s goal, for it will mean perfect, unbroken knowledge of Christ and fellowship with Him. Paul knows by experience the difficulty of remaining loyal to the end, of being so conformed to Christ’s death that the power of sin will not revive its mastery over him. So his apparent uncertainty here of reaching the goal is not distrust of God. It is distrust of himself.

Authority, both external and internal, supports the reading <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξανάστ</span>. is found nowhere else in N.T., and never in LXX. In later Greek it means “expulsion”. It occurs only here in this sense. Holst, suggests that <span class="greekheb">ἐξαν</span>. is used here of the actual resurrection, because <span class="greekheb">ἀνάστασις</span> was used above of believers with an ethical, ideal meaning. We are disposed to believe (with Ws[56]. and others) that Paul is thinking only of the resurrection of believers (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Ps. Sol. 3:13–16 for Jewish thought on this subject, the thought which had been Paul’s mental atmosphere). This is his usual standpoint. In the famous passage <a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:12</a> ff. it is exclusively of Christians he speaks. We have no information as to what he taught regarding a general resurrection. But considering that it is with spontaneous, artless letters we have to do, and not with theoretical discussions, it would be hazardous to say that he ignored or denied a general resurrection. For him the resurrection of Christians depends on and is conformed to the resurrection of their Lord. Teichmann (<span class="ital">Auferstehung u. Gericht</span>, p. 67), comparing chap. <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Php 1:23</a> with this passage, holds that Paul, although he has replaced the idea of resurrection by that of a continuous existence after death, occasionally (as here) uses the traditional <span class="ital">termini technici.</span> This may be so. More probably at one time he would give prominence to the thought of uninterrupted fellowship with Christ after death, while at another his longings would centre round the great crisis when Christ should acknowledge all His faithful servants and make them full sharers in His glory. It is not to be doubted that Paul, like the rest of the early Christians, expected that crisis soon to come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[54] <span class="ital">.</span> <span class="ital">Moods and Tenses</span> (Burton, Goodwin).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[55] <span class="ital">.</span> <span class="ital">Moods and Tenses</span> (Burton, Goodwin).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] .

It is language which views vividly, <span class="ital">in isolation</span>, one aspect of the “Pilgrim’s Progress” towards heaven; the aspect of our need of continual watching, self-surrender, and prayer, in order to the development of that likeness without which heaven would not be heaven. The other side of the matter is the efficacy and perseverance of the grace which comes out in our watching; without which we should not watch; which “predestinates” us “to be conformed to the image of the Son of God” (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>). The mystery lies, as it were, between two apparently parallel lines; the reality of an omnipotent grace, and the reality of the believer’s duty. As this line or that is regarded, in its entire reality, the language of assurance or of contingency is appropriate. But the parallel lines, as they seem now, prove at last to converge in glory (<a href="/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day....">John 6:39-40</a>; <a href="/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>; <a href="/context/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:...">John 10:27-29</a>; <a href="/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ....">1 Thessalonians 5:23-24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>See Hooker’s Sermon <span class="ital">Of the Certainty and Perpetuity of Faith in the Elect</span>, especially the closing paragraphs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I might</span>] Lit., and here better, with R.V., <span class="bld">I may</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the resurrection of the dead</span>] The better supported reading gives, as R.V., <span class="bld">the resurrection from the dead</span>. The phrase implies a certain <span class="ital">leaving behind of</span> “the dead”; and this is further emphasized in the Greek, where the noun rendered “resurrection” is the rare word <span class="ital">exanastasis</span>, i.e. the common word (<span class="ital">anastasis</span>) for resurrection, strengthened by the preposition meaning “from.” This must not, however, be pressed far; later Greek has a tendency towards compounding words without necessarily strengthening the meaning. It is the <span class="ital">setting</span> of the word here which makes an emphasis in it likely.—It has been inferred that St Paul here refers to a special and select resurrection, so to speak, and that this is “the first resurrection” of <a href="/context/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection....">Revelation 20:5-6</a>, interpreted as a literal resurrection of either all saints or specially privileged saints, before that of the mass of mankind. (Such an interpretation of Revelation 20 appears as early as Tertullian, cent. 2, <span class="ital">de Monogamiâ</span>, c. x.). But against this explanation here lies the fact that St Paul nowhere else makes any <span class="ital">unmistakable</span> reference to such a prospect (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-23.htm" title="But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming....">1 Corinthians 15:23-24</a> is not decisive, and certainly not <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>); and that this makes it unlikely that he should refer to it here, where he manifestly is dealing with a grand and ruling article of his hope. We explain it accordingly of the glorious prospect of the Resurrection of the saints in general. And we account for the special phrase by taking him to be filled with the thought of <span class="ital">the Lord’s</span> Resurrection as the pledge and, so to speak, the summary of that of His people; and <span class="ital">His</span> Resurrection was emphatically “<span class="ital">from</span> the dead.”—Or it may be that we have here to explain “the dead” as a term of abstract reference, meaning practically “the state of the dead,” the world of death.—In any case, the phrase refers to “the resurrection of life” (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>; <a href="/john/5-29.htm" title="And shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.">John 5:29</a>); “the resurrection of the just” (<a href="/luke/14-14.htm" title="And you shall be blessed; for they cannot recompense you: for you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.">Luke 14:14</a>); differenced from that of “the unjust” (<a href="/acts/24-15.htm" title="And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.">Acts 24:15</a>), whether or no in time, certainly in an awful distinction of conditions and results. The blessed resurrection is here called “<span class="ital">the</span> resurrection” as the blessed life is called “<span class="ital">the</span> life” (e.g. <a href="/1_john/5-12.htm" title="He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life.">1 John 5:12</a>). The antithesis is not non-resurrection, and non-existence, but such resurrection, and such existence, as are ruin and woe.—It is observable that the Apostle here implies his expectation of death, to be followed by resurrection; not of survival till the Lord’s Return.
