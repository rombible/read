IS IT POSSIBLE TO OFFER UP PRAISE IN A PRISON AND TO WRITE OF JOY FROM A JAILHOUSE? <p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">It is indeed, as demonstrated by the wonderful book of Philippians. The words <i>joy</i> and <i>rejoicing</i> are found no less than 18 times in Philippians more than any other biblical book for its size. The secret and source of this joy is Christ, which name in various forms appears some 70 times in this epistle.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Paul.</b> He was also known as Saul of Tarsus (Acts 9:11). This relentless enemy of Christians (Acts 8:3; 22:5, 19; 26:11; Gal. 1:13) would, following his conversion (Acts 9:3-9), become the greatest missionary, church planter, soul winner, and theologian in church history, authoring nearly half of the New Testament books!<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

It was some 700 miles from Rome and enjoyed full Roman citizenship privileges.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In A.D. 57, at the end of his third missionary trip (some five years after his first visit), Paul seems to have paid two brief visits to Philippi (see 2 Cor. 1:16; Acts 19:21; 20:1-3).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The year A.D. 60 finds the apostle a prisoner in Rome. Acts 28:30-31 indicates that he was confined to his own hired house, being chained to various Roman soldiers every six hours. Although he could not preach in public, he was allowed to write (Eph. 6:20; Phil. 1:7, 14, 16; Col. 4:18; Philem. 1, 10, 13).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> It was therefore at this time, some ten years after his original visit to Philippi, that Paul wrote the epistle of Philippians to his favorite church.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> This church, upon learning of his imprisonment in Rome, had sent a love offering by way of Epaphroditus. They had already sent him two other love gifts years back for his missionary endeavors in Thessalonica (Phil. 4:15-16).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> While in Rome, Epaphroditus had become very ill and nearly died. But God spared his life. Paul thus writes Philippians both to thank them for their gift and also to report the good news of Epaphroditus’ recovery.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>1.
