How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved - That is, in heaven.

O <span class="accented">Daniel</span>, <span class="accented">a man greatly beloved.</span> This is the same term as that applied to Daniel (<a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>), "man of desires" (which see). <span class="accented">Understand the words that I speak unto thee</span>; "have understanding in the words," or <span class="accented">better</span>, "matters, which I am speaking or telling to thee." As the language used was one intelligible to Daniel, it was needless to command him to understand the words, but the "matters" communicated by the words might require a special effort of attention to comprehend. <span class="accented">Debareem</span> means "matters" as well as "words." <span class="accented">And stand upright</span>; "'stand upon thy standing." Gesenius would render this word when it occurs before (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>), "place;" but both here and there the contrast is in the attitude. From being absolutely prone, as in the eighth chapter, or on hands and knees as here, he is to be upright, and, <span class="accented">taking</span> his previous attitude into account, this is not merely to stand where he is, and neither approach nor depart. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; the Vulgate has <span class="accented">gradu. For unto thee am I now sent.</span> This assigns a reason for the command to stand upon his feet. In the Assyrian marbles, however lowly the obeisance made to the monarch by any one admitted to his presence, he stands when he receives the monarch's commands. Standing implies attention. <span class="accented">And when he had spoken this word unto me</span>, <span class="accented">I stood trembling.</span> He obeyed the command, but still trembling took hold of him in the angelic presence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse the expression they drank wine is repeated for the purpose of making manifest the connection between the drinking and the praising of the gods. The wickedness lay in this, that they drank out of the holy vessels of the temple of the God of Israel to glorify (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;, to praise by the singing of songs) their heathen gods in songs of praise. In doing this they did not only place "Jehovah on a perfect level with their gods" (Hvernick), but raised them above the Lord of heaven, as Daniel (<a href="/daniel/5-23.htm">Daniel 5:23</a>) charged the king. The carrying away of the temple vessels to Babylon and placing them in the temple of Bel was a sign of the defeat of the God to whom these vessels were consecrated (see under <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>); the use of these vessels in the drinking of wine at a festival, amid the singing of songs in praise of the gods, was accordingly a celebrating of these gods as victorious over the God of Israel. And it was not a spirit of hostility aroused against the Jews which gave occasion, as Kranichfeld has well remarked, to this celebration of the victory of his god; but, as the narrative informs us, it was the reckless madness of the drunken king and of his drunken guests (cf. <a href="/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>) during the festival which led them to think of the God of the Jews, whom they supposed they had subdued along with His people, although He had by repeated miracles forced the heathen world-rulers to recognise His omnipotence (cf. <a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>:, <a href="/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a> [<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>], 31 [34], 34 [37]). In the disregard of these revelations consisted, as Daniel represents to Belshazzar (cf. <a href="/daniel/5-18.htm">Daniel 5:18</a>), the dishonour done to the Lord of heaven, although these vessels of the sanctuary might have been profaned merely by using them as common drinking vessels, or they might have been used also in religious libations as vessels consecrated to the gods, of which the text makes no mention, although the singing of songs to the praise of the gods along with the drinking makes the offering of libations very probable. The six predicates of the gods are divided by the copula  &#1493;into two classes: gold and silver - brass, iron, wood and stone, in order to represent before the eyes in an advancing degree the vanity of these gods. <p><a href="/daniel/5-4.htm">Daniel 5:4</a> <p>The warning signs, the astonishment of Belshazzar, the inability of the wise men to give counsel, and the advice of the queen.<p><a href="/daniel/5-4.htm">Daniel 5:4</a><p>Unexpectedly and suddenly the wanton mad revelry of the king and his guests was brought to a close amid terror by means of a warning sign. The king saw the finger of a man's hand writing on the plaster of the wall of the festival chamber, and he was so alarmed that his whole body shook. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1488; places the sign in immediate connection with the drinking and the praising of the gods. The translation, in the self-same hour, is already shown to be inadmissible (see under <a href="/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a>). The Kethiv &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; (came forth) is not to be rejected as the indefinite determination of the subject, because the subject follows after it; the Keri &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1492; is to be rejected, because, though it suits the gender, it does not in respect of number accord with the subject following. The king does not see the whole hand, but only &#1497;&#1491;&#1488; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;, the end of the hand, that is, the fingers which write. This immediately awakened the thought that the writing was by a supernatural being, and alarmed the king out of his intoxication. The fingers wrote on the plaster of the wall over against the candlestick which stood on the table at which the king sat, and which reflected its light perceptibly on the white wall opposite, so that the fingers writing could be distinctly seen. The feast had been prolonged into the darkness of the night, and the wall of the chamber was not wainscotted, but only plastered with lime, as such chambers are found in the palaces of Nimrud and Khorsabad covered over only with mortar (cf. Layard's Nineveh and Babylon). </body></html>
