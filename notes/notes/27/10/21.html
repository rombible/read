This may be brought out by paraphrasing the verse as follows: “It is true that the prince of Javan will attack you, but do not despair at the thought of one persecuting empire succeeding another. It is all written in the Scripture of truth:” that is, in the revelations which God had already conveyed, or shortly would convey, to Daniel, and in the book of Providence (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm" title="Your eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in your book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.">Psalm 139:16</a>).

God’s decrees are spoken of as if they were committed to writing, and registered in a book. <span class="ital">And there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince — </span>This may mean that the Jews had no friend in the court of Persia, who would co-operate with the angel, “to forward the prophet’s designs in behalf of his people, but Michael, their prince; and that Daniel must depend on him alone to disappoint the devices which were forming against them.” — Scott. As this chapter is intended as an introduction to the prophecies in the next two chapters, it may be observed that the sum of it is this: that the prayer of Daniel, in behalf of the Jews, had been heard; but that the Jews would be crossed in their design of building the temple; that nevertheless God would protect them; that the prince of <span class="ital">Javan, </span>or of the Greeks, that is, Alexander the Great, would come against the Persians; and that the principal angels, such as he was who talked with Daniel, and Michael the archangel, would be employed by God to defend and assist the Jews, and to strengthen the kings who were for the Jews, as, at the beginning of the following chapter, the angel who here speaks is said to have strengthened King Darius. The affliction and fasting of Daniel, who mourned for three weeks, should be considered as the effect of his zeal for the glory of God, to be manifested in the restoration of the Jews; it being the character of pious and zealous persons to afflict themselves when the glory of God is obstructed, and to offer up fervent prayers for the peace and prosperity of their country. With respect to what the angel said to Daniel, of his labouring and striving for the Jews against those who sought their ruin, it is a proof that God makes use of the ministry of angels to execute his designs, and for the protection and benefit of those whom he is pleased to bless. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:10-21 Whenever we enter into communion with God, it becomes us to have a due sense of the infinite distance between us and the holy God. How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I will show thee what is noted in, the scripture of truth - The word noted here means "written, or recorded." The scripture of truth means the true writing, and the reference is doubtless to the Divine purposes or decrees in this matter - for<p>(a) there is no other writing where these things were then found;<p>(b) the angel came to make known what could be known in no other way, and therefore what was not yet found in any book to which man had access;<p>(c) this language accords with common representations in the Scriptures respecting future events.<p>They are described as written down in a book that is in the hands of God, in which are recorded all future events - the names of those that shall be saved - and all the deeds of men. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/32-34.htm">Deuteronomy 32:34</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>. The representation is figurative, of course; and the meaning is, that, in the view of the Divine mind, all future events are as certain as if they were actually recorded as history, or as if they were now all written down. The angel came that he might unfold a portion of that volume, and disclose the contents of its secret pages; that is, describe an important series of events of great interest to the Jewish people and to the world at large.<p>And there is none that holdeth with me in, these things - Margin, "strengtheneth himself." So the Hebrew. The idea is, that there was none that rendered aid in this matter, or that stood by him, and would accomplish the designs which he was meditating in their behalf pertaining to Persia. The angel saw that there were powerful influences against the interests of the Hebrew people at work in the court of Persia; that it was necessary that they should be counteracted; that unless this were done, fearful calamities would come upon the Jewish people, and they would be subjected to great embarrassments in their efforts to rebuild their city and temple, and he says that there was no one whose aid could be permanently and certainly relied on but that of Michael. He himself was to return to the court of Persia to endeavor to counteract the influence of the "prince of Persia," but, as in the former case when on his way to Daniel Dan 10:13, he would not have been able to counteract the machinations of that prince if it had not been for the interposition of Michael, so he felt now that reliance was still to be placed on his assistance in the matter.<p>But Michael your prince - See the notes at <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>. The patron, or guardian of your people, and of their interests. The idea intended to be conveyed here undoubtedly is, that Michael was a guardian angel for the Jewish people; that he had special charge of their affairs; that his interposition might be depended on in the time of trouble and danger, and that, under him, their interests would be safe. No one can prove that this is not so; and as on earth some of the most important favors that we enjoy are conferred by the instrumentality of others; as we are often defended when in danger by them; as we are counseled and directed by them; as God raises up for the orphan, and the widow, and the insane, and the sorrowful, and the feeble, those of wealth, and power, and learning, who can better guard their interests than they could themselves, and as these relations are often sustained, and these favors conferred by those who are invisible to the recipients, so it gives, in a higher sense, a new beauty to the arrangements of the universe to suppose that this benevolent office is often undertaken and discharged by angelic beings.<p>Thus they may defend us from danger; ward off the designs of our enemies; defeat their machinations, and save us from numberless evils that would otherwise come upon us. This view receives additional confirmation, if it be admitted that there are evil angels, and that that seek the ruin of mankind. They are malignant; they tempt the race of man; they have power far superior to our own; they can set in operation a train of evil influences which we can neither foresee nor counteract; and they can excite the minds of wicked men to do us injury in a way which we cannot anticipate, and against which we cannot defend ourselves. In these circumstances, anyone can perceive that there is concinnity and propriety in the supposition that there are good beings of a higher order who feel an interest in the welfare of man, and who come to us, on their benevolent errand, to defend us from danger, and to aid us in our efforts to escape from the perils of our fallen condition, and to reach the kingdom of heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. noted in the scripture of truth&#8212;in the secret book of God's decrees (Ps 139:16; Re 5:1), which are truth, that is, the things which shall most surely come to pass, being determined by God (compare Joh 17:17).<p>none &#8230; but Michael&#8212;To him alone of the angels the office of protecting Israel, in concert with the angelic speaker, was delegated; all the world powers were against Israel.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the scripture of truth, </span> i.e. in the peremptory decree and purpose of God, more authentic and unalterable than the laws of the Medes and Persians.

The use of it is explained by Kranichfeld and Zockler as due to the fears for the theocracy aroused by the thought that the Greek power was rising against Israel. If  the idea had been that Gabriel was called to hurry back to his post because of the threatened approach of the Prince of Grecia, then it might be defended; only even then either the fact of the necessity for speedy return to the Persian court would have been emphasized, or the fact that he is delaying to make known the contents of the writing of truth. It is, perhaps, better rendered by "nevertheless," as it is in <a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. We can see the force of this particle by turning to ver. 7, "I Daniel alone saw the vision, for the men that were with me saw not the vision, but (equivalent to 'nevertheless') a great quaking fell upon them." This clause, we see, then, has all the appearance of being intruded violently into the text; it interrupts the progress of thought, and does not suit the context. There is no indication that he, Gabriel, will have to hasten back to the court of Persia with such rapidity as would necessitate the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">abal</span>), "nevertheless." But even so, why revert in the next clause to the contents of ver. 20, without the slightest indication that the line of thought in the past clause was dropped as soon as taken up? The last clause of this verse reads much better in connection with ver. 20 than with ver. 21<span class="accented">a</span>. Behrmann transposes the clauses in this verse, so as to get over tiffs difficulty, and Professor M. Stuart puts the first clause in brackets. "The scripture of truth" is a phrase that might have been suggested by <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>, "In thy book were all my members written." It is in line with a great number of phrases in apocalyptic literature; thus Enoch 93:1, "And after that Enoch began to recount from the books;" the Book of Jubilees, 1:24; 4:31; 5:15, etc., "the tablets of the heavens." The idea was that all the events that were to happen in the world's history were record, d beforehand in the books or tablets of the heavens. It is from failing to notice this that the late Professor Fuller was led to say "the scripture of truth "is the title for the ensuing section. Against this view is the preposition "in;" it is in the scripture of truth, among other matters, that these things are noted which form the succeeding section. At the same time, the form the representation of the heavenly books, which note beforehand what was to happen, assumes here is simpler than that in Enoch or the Book of Jubilees. <span class="accented">And there is none that holdeth with me in these things</span>, <span class="accented">but Michael your</span> prince. As we have above said, this clause is closely connected with ver. 20. <span class="accented">In these things.</span> This is rendered in the Revised Version "against these," in accordance with the majority of recent commentators, Ewald, Hitzig, Fuller, Zockler, Bevan, Stuart, Kranlohfeld Keil, Kliefoth, Behrmann, etc., and, among older commentators, Jephet-ibn-Ali; but none of the older versions have it. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; the Peshitta has the preposition; the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">in his omnibus.</span> With these Calvin agrees, though Luther renders, <span class="accented">wider jene.</span> Certainly, the most common meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> in such a connection is "against." So, notwithstanding the weight of the versions, we feel constrained to translate, "against these persons," and not "in regard to these things." In the first place, "in" is a far less frequent meaning of the preposition, and next, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">aylayh</span>), "these," most naturally refers to the persons last named. Although "the Prince of Grecia" was to be the instrument of the overthrow of the power of Persia, it was to become oppressive afterwards, as had been revealed to Daniel in the vision of the ram and the he-goat. Gabriel, the angel of prophecy, the special guardian of God's great ideal kingdom of heaven, was assisted in his guardianship only by Michael, the angelic Prince of Israel. The fact that along the line of the development of Israel as a nation ran, so far at least, the Divine plan concerning the kingdom of heaven, made it natural that Michael should favour that which furthered the interests of the race that was more specially under his care. As we have already said, we cannot even guess at the nature of these angelic conflicts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>cf. <a href="/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11</a>.
