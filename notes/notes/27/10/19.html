How shall we, that are dust and ashes, speak to the Lord of glory? Nothing is more likely, nothing more effectual to revive the drooping spirits of the saints, than to be assured of God's love to them. From the very first day we begin to look toward God in a way of duty, he is ready to meet us in the way of mercy. Thus ready is God to hear prayer. When the angel had told the prophet of the things to come, he was to return, and oppose the decrees of the Persian kings against the Jews. The angels are employed as God's ministering servants, Heb 1:14. Though much was done against the Jews by the kings of Persia, God permitting it, much more mischief would have been done if God had not prevented it. He would now more fully show what were God's purposes, of which the prophecies form an outline; and we are concerned to study what is written in these Scriptures of truth, for they belong to our everlasting peace. While Satan and his angels, and evil counsellors, excite princes to mischief against the church, we may rejoice that Christ our Prince, and all his mighty angels, act against our enemies; but we ought not to expect many to favour us in this evil world. Yet the whole counsel of God shall be established; and let each one pray, Lord Jesus, be our righteousness now, and thou wilt be our everlasting confidence, through life, in death, at the day of judgment, and for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And said, O man greatly beloved - See the notes at <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>.<p>Fear not - Neither at my presence, nor at what I have to say.

And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> The LXX. has its ordinary translation of the phrase rendered, "man greatly beloved (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>)." They give three words for the repetition of the command, "be strong:" <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>, "<span class="accented">be in</span> good health;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "play the man;" <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>, "be strong." In the last clause the third person is retained, "Let my lord speak, for <span class="accented">he</span> strengthened me" - a change made for symmetry. Theodotion is much closer to the Massoretic text, only he, too, varies the words in the command, and has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>. The Peshitta, like Theodotion, varies the word in the command, In the last clause the verb is put in the passive, "and I was strengthened," For the command the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">confortare et esto robustus</span>; but the last clause is in strict agreement with the Massoretic. It is to be noted that the repetition of the imperative, united by <span class="accented">ray</span>, is unexampled; the various renderings in the versions point to this being felt a difficulty, but do not suggest any variations of reading. Not only is the strengthening touch given, but consoling words are added, "Be strong, yea, be strong." Daniel was called upon to put forth energy, to summon his forces mental and spiritual. He had received the strengthening touch, but his own volition must go along with the aid divinely afforded. It is the combination which we find in our Lord's life; without faith even the miraculous power of our Lord could not be put forth. As we have noted, there is some uncertainty as to the reading, but no change would alter the sense of the passage, "And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened." The words spoken called forth the power that was latent, and had been imparted to Daniel. <span class="accented">And said</span>, <span class="accented">Let my lord speak</span>, <span class="accented">for thou hast strengthened me.</span> Even to hold converse with angelic beings, entailed expenditure of vital energy. The overpowering sense of the spiritual has to be resisted, at least so far, in order that mental action may go on. Had strength not been imparted, the revelations bestowed would not have produced any permanent impression on the mind. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The remarkable endowments of Daniel are again stated (according to <a href="/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11</a>) to give weight to the advice that he should be called in. The words from &#1502;&#1508;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512; [interpreting] to &#1508;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; [doubts] are an explanatory parenthetical clause, after which the following verb, according to rule, joins itself to &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. In the parenthetical clause the nomen actonis &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492; [showing] is used instead of the participle, whereby the representation of the continued capability lying in the participle is transferred to that of each separate instance; literally, interpreting dreams, the explanation of mysteries and dissolving knots. The allusion of &#1508;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1488; to &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1497; &#1495;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>, is only apparent, certainly is not aimed at, since the former of these expressions has an entirely different meaning. Knots stands figuratively for involved complicated problems. That Daniel did not at first appear along with the wise men, but was only called after the queen had advised it, is to be explained on this simple ground, that he was no longer president over the magicians, but on the occasion of a new king ascending the throne had lost that situation, and been put into another office (cf. <a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>). The words of the queen do not prove that Belshazzar was not acquainted with Daniel, but only show that he had forgotten the service rendered by him to Nebuchadnezzar; for according to <a href="/daniel/5-13.htm">Daniel 5:13</a> he was well acquainted with the personal circumstances of Daniel. </body></html>
