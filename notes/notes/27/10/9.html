This chapter relates the beginning of Daniel's last vision, which is continued to the end of the book. The time would be long before all would be accomplished; and much of it is not yet fulfilled. Christ appeared to Daniel in a glorious form, and it should engage us to think highly and honourably of him. Let us admire his condescension for us and our salvation. There remained no strength in Daniel. The greatest and best of men cannot bear the full discoveries of the Divine glory; for no man can see it, and live; but glorified saints see Christ as he is, and can bear the sight. How dreadful soever Christ may appear to those under convictions of sin, there is enough in his word to quiet their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet heard I the voice of his words - What the angel said when he appeared to him Daniel has not recorded. He says <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a> that the voice of his words was "like the voice of a multitude." It is probable that those who were with him had heard that voice, and hearing it, and being struck with the remarkable character of the vision, they had suddenly fled in alarm. Daniel heard more distinctly what he said, though it does not yet appear that he had heard anything more than the sound of his voice.<p>And when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face - Compare the notes at <a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>. Lengerke renders this, "I sank into a deep sleep," etc. This is undoubtedly the meaning, that when he heard this voice he was overcome, and sank prostrate and senseless upon the earth. The sense of the Hebrew may be thus expressed: "I became (&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;  ha&#770;y&#305;&#770;yt&#305;&#770;y) oppressed with sleep," etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. voice of his words&#8212;the sound of his words.<p>was I in a deep sleep&#8212;"I sank into a deep sleep" [Lengkerke].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Yet heard I the voice of his words; </span> nevertheless he made me to hear: here was power in weakness, and yet this added to his fear and frailty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground; </span> as one that swooned, or as one that slumbered, and as one that adored the ground. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet heard I the voice of his words,....

The Septuagint translator seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">nephalti</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">nir'dam</span>). Theodotion is somewhat nearer the Massoretic text, but renders <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by "stupefied." The Pesifitta is an accurate rendering of the text behind the Septuagint. Jerome agrees with Theodotion, rendering <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by <span class="accented">consternatus</span>; he strengthens the phrase, "my face toward the ground," by inserting <span class="accented">haerebat.</span> It would seem that <span class="accented">nirdam</span> is of doubtful authenticity. It may be said this was omitted because of the difficulty of imagining the prophet seeing while in a deep sleep. But a state of sleep does not preclude the possibility of seeing a vision. In the parallel passage (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>) the LXX. has no difficulty in translating, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. By assuming the reading of the LXX. and the Peshitta to be correct, we make the process of events more natural; according to the Massoretic reading, though we have an account of his sense of weakness, we have no record that he <span class="accented">fell</span> to the ground, and yet we are told that he was "in a deep sleep, with his face toward the ground" The resemblance is very great to <a href="/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, "A thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof in thoughts from the vision of the night, when sleep falleth on men (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)." If there has been imitation, the originality and beauty of the  passage in Job render it certain that it is the original. It seems more likely to be a change introduced to bring the revelation to Daniel in line with other prophetic revelations. The attitude Daniel assumed was one which implied the deepest abasement  - the envoy of the great king kisses the ground at the feet of the envoy of the King of kings. Even the revelation given while sleep had fallen on the subject of the revelation, seems paralleled with what took place at the Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>, "And Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep," yet it was when they were awaked that they saw the glory). So with Gethsemane. The Hebrew word is the same as that used when Eve was taken out of the side of Adam; he then was asleep - a deepsleep had fallen on him, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)."

From these words it appears that Belshazzar commanded the temple vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem to be brought, not, as Hvernick thinks, for the purpose of seeking, in his anxiety on account of the siege of the city, the favour of the God of the Jews, but to insult this God in the presence of his own gods. The supposition of anxiety on account of the siege does not at all harmonize with the celebration of so riotous a festival. Besides, the vessels are not brought for the purpose of making libations in order to propitiate the God to whom they were consecrated, but, according to the obvious statement of the text, only to drink out of them from the madness of lust. &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, that they may drink;  before the imperf. expresses the design of the bringing of the vessels. &#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492;, to drink out of, as <a href="/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5</a>; <a href="/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1500;&#1503;, the wives of the king; cf. <a href="/nehemiah/2-6.htm">Nehemiah 2:6</a> with <a href="/psalms/45-10.htm">Psalm 45:10</a>. &#1500;&#1495;&#1504;&#1503;, concubines; this word stands in the Targg. for the Hebr. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;. The lxx have here, and also at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-23.htm">Daniel 5:23</a>, omitted mention of the women, according to the custom of the Macedonians, Greeks, and Romans (cf. Herod. Ch. 5:18; Corn. Nep. proem. 6); but Xenophon (Cyr. v. 2. 28) and Curtius (v. 1. 38) expressly declare that among the Babylonians the wives also were present at festivals.</body></html>
