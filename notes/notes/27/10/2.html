Calmet, however, is of opinion, that his sorrow arose principally from the obscurity which the prophet found in the prophecies revealed to him; which, indeed, may be partly collected from the angel’s touching upon no other cause of mourning. In consequence of Daniel’s fasting, &c., the angel appears, and explains to him, in a clearer manner, what had been more obscurely revealed in the preceding visions. <span class="ital">Three full weeks </span>— Hebrew, <span class="ital">three weeks of days. </span>So we read of <span class="ital">a month of days, </span><a href="/genesis/29-4.htm" title="And Jacob said to them, My brothers, from where be you?

The prophet made likewise an alteration in his dress, and did not anoint himself as usual after the eastern manner, <a href="/2_samuel/12-20.htm" title="Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.">2 Samuel 12:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-17.htm" title="But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;">Matthew 6:17</a>; for the Jews never anointed themselves in times of mourning and humiliation.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-9. This chapter relates the beginning of Daniel's last vision, which is continued to the end of the book. The time would be long before all would be accomplished; and much of it is not yet fulfilled. Christ appeared to Daniel in a glorious form, and it should engage us to think highly and honourably of him. Let us admire his condescension for us and our salvation. There remained no strength in Daniel. The greatest and best of men cannot bear the full discoveries of the Divine glory; for no man can see it, and live; but glorified saints see Christ as he is, and can bear the sight. How dreadful soever Christ may appear to those under convictions of sin, there is enough in his word to quiet their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In those days I Daniel was mourning - I was afflicting myself; that is, he had set apart this time as an extraordinary fast. He was sad and troubled. He does not say on what account he was thus troubled, but there can be little doubt that it was on account of his people. This was two years after the order had been given by Cyrus for the restoration of the Hebrew people to their country, but it is not improbable that they met with many embarrassments in their efforts to return, and possibly there may have sprung up in Babylon some difficulties on the subject that greatly affected the mind of Daniel. The difficulties attending such an enterprise as that of restoring a captured people to their country, when the march lay across a vast desert, would at any time have been such as to have made an extraordinary season of prayer and fasting proper.<p>Three full weeks - Margin, "weeks of days." Hebrew, "Three sevens of days." He does not say whether he had designedly set apart that time to be occupied as a season of fasting, or whether he had, under the influence of deep feeling, continued his fast from day to day until it reached that period. Either supposition will accord with the circumstances of the case, and either would have justified such an act at anytime, for it would be undoubtedly proper to designate a time of extraordinary devotion, or, under the influence of deep feeling, of domestic trouble, of national affliction, to continue such religious exercises from day to day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. mourning&#8212;that is, afflicting myself by fasting from "pleasant bread, flesh and wine" (Da 10:3), as a sign of sorrow, not for its own sake. Compare Mt 9:14, "fast," answering to "mourn" (Da 10:15). Compare 1Co 8:8; 1Ti 4:3, which prove that "fasting" is not an indispensable Christian obligation; but merely an outward expression of sorrow, and separation from ordinary worldly enjoyments, in order to give one's self to prayer (Ac 13:2). Daniel's mourning was probably for his countrymen, who met with many obstructions to their building of the temple, from their adversaries in the Persian court.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There are several causes of Daniel’s mourning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

It may have been that he was grieved that so few of the people were willing to avail themselves of the privilege. We are here assuming that the chronology of this passage reckons from the overthrow of Nabunahid, that is, from Cyrus's accession to the throne of Babylon; but, as we have seen, this "third year" may be reckoned from his assumption of the title King of Persia, <span class="accented">San Parsua</span>, in which case it may be the same year with that vision narrated in the previous chapter. <span class="accented">Three full weeks</span>; literally, <span class="accented">three weeks of days</span> - to mark off the duration of Daniel's fast from the weeks of years referred to in the ninth chapter. Keil objects to this interpretation, but assigns no reason. At the same time, it is to be observed that "year of days" means a full year, but a week is such a short period that the necessity of saying that it was complete by defining it a "week of days" is not so obvious, and is unexampled. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse there is a brief comprehensive statement regarding the fulfilment of the dream to the king, which is then extended from v. 26 to 30. At the end of twelve months, i.e., after the expiry of twelve months from the time of the dream, the king betook himself to his palace at Babylon, i.e., to the flat roof of the palace; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>. The addition at Babylon does not indicate that the king was then living at a distance from Babylon, as Berth., v. Leng., Maur., and others imagine, but is altogether suitable to the matter, because Nebuchadnezzar certainly had palaces outside of Babylon, but it is made with special reference to the language of the king which follows regarding the greatness of Babylon. &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; means here not simply to begin to speak, but properly to answer, and suggests to us a foregoing colloquy of the king with himself in his own mind. Whether one may conclude from that, in connection with the statement of time, after twelve months, that Nebuchadnezzar, exactly one year after he had received the important dream, was actively engaging himself regarding that dream, must remain undetermined, and can be of no use to a psychological explanation of the occurrence of the dream. The thoughts which Nebuchadnezzar expresses in v. 26 (<a href="/daniel/4-29.htm">Daniel 4:29</a>) are not favourable to such a supposition. Had the king remembered that dream and its interpretation, he would scarcely have spoken so proudly of his splendid city which he had built as he does in v. 27 (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>).<p>When he surveyed the great and magnificent city from the top of his palace, "pride overcame him," so that he dedicated the building of this great city as the house of his kingdom to the might of his power and the honour of his majesty. From the addition &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488; it does not follow that this predicate was a standing Epitheton ornans of Babylon, as with &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; , <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>, and other towns of Asia; for although Pausanias and Strabo call Babylon &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; and &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, yet it bears this designation as a surname in no ancient author. But in <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a> this predicate, quoted from the passage before us, is given to Babylon, and in the mouth of Nebuchadnezzar it quite corresponds to the self-praise of his great might by which he had built Babylon as the residence of a great king. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; designates, as &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; more frequently, not the building or founding of a city, for the founding of Babylon took place in the earliest times after the Flood (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>), and was dedicated to the god Belus, or the mythic Semiramis, i.e., in the pre-historic time; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; means the building up, the enlargement, the adorning of the city &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, for the house of the kingdom, i.e., for a royal residence; cf. The related expression &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="/amos/7-13.htm">Amos 7:13</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; stands in this connection neither for town nor for &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; (<a href="/daniel/4-29.htm">Daniel 4:29</a>), but has the meaning dwelling-place. The royalty of the Babylonian kingdom has its dwelling-place, its seat, in Babylon, the capital of the kingdom.<p>With reference to the great buildings of Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, vide the statements of Berosus in Josephi Ant. x. 11, 1, and con. Ap. i. 19, and of Abydenus in Eusebii praepar. evang. ix. 41, and Chron. i. p. 59; also the delineation of these buildings in Duncker's Gesch. des Alterth. i. p. 854ff. The presumption of this language appears in the words, "by the strength of my might, and for the splendour (honour) of my majesty." Thus Nebuchadnezzar describes himself as the creator of his kingdom and of its glory, while the building up of his capital as a residence bearing witness to his glory and his might pointed at the same time to the duration of his dynasty. This proud utterance is immediately followed by his humiliation by the omnipotent God. A voice fell from heaven. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, of the sudden coming of a divine revelation. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; for the passive, as <a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>. The perf. &#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; denotes the matter as finished. At the moment when Nebuchadnezzar heard in his soul the voice from heaven, the prophecy begins to be fulfilled, the king becomes deranged, and is deprived of his royalty.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-29.htm">Daniel 4:29-30</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32-33</a>)<p>(4:25-30)<p>The fulfilling of the dream.<p>Nebuchadnezzar narrates the fulfilment of the dream altogether objectively, so that he speaks of himself in the third person. Berth., Hitz., and others find here that the author falls out of the role of the king into the narrative tone, and thus betrays the fact that some other than the king framed the edict. But this conclusion is opposed by the fact that Nebuchadnezzar from v. 31 speaks of his recovery again in the first person. Thus it is beyond doubt that the change of person has its reason in the matter itself. Certainly it could not be in this that Nebuchadnezzar thought it unbecoming to speak in his own person of his madness; for if he had had so tender a regard for his own person, he would not have published the whole occurrence in a manifesto addressed to his subjects. But the reason of his speaking of his madness in the third person, as if some other one were narrating it, lies simply in this, that in that condition he was not Ich  equals  Ego (Kliefoth). With the return of the Ich, I, on the recovery from his madness, Nebuchadnezzar begins again to narrate in the first person (v. 31 34).<p>Here the contents of the prophecy, v. 22 (v. 25), are repeated, and then in v. 30 (v. 33) it is stated that the word regarding Nebuchadnezzar immediately began to be fulfilled. On &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1488; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, cf. <a href="/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a>. &#1505;&#1508;&#1514;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, to go to an end. The prophecy goes to an end when it is realized, is fulfilled. The fulfilling is related in the words of the prophecy. Nebuchadnezzar is driven from among men, viz., by his madness, in which he fled from intercourse with men, and lived under the open air of heaven as a beast among the beasts, eating grass like the cattle; and his person was so neglected, that his hair became like the eagles' fathers and his nails like birds' claws. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; are abbreviated comparisons; vide under <a href="/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>. That this condition was a peculiar appearance of the madness is expressly mentioned in v. 31 (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>), where the recovery is designated as the restoration of his understanding.<p>This malady, in which men regard themselves as beasts and imitate their manner of life, is called insania zoanthropica, or, in the case of those who think themselves wolves, lycanthropia. The condition is described in a manner true to nature. Even "as to the eating of grass," as G. Rsch, in the Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xv. p. 521, remarks, "there is nothing to perplex or that needs to be explained. It is a circumstance that has occurred in recent times, as e.g., in the case of a woman in the Wrttemberg asylum for the insane." Historical documents regarding this form of madness have been collected by Trusen in his Sitten, Gebr. u. Krank. der alten Hebrer, p. 205f., 2nd ed., and by Friedreich in Zur Bibel, i. p. 308f.<p>(Note: Regarding the statement, "his hair grew as the feathers of an eagle," etc., Friedr. remarks, p. 316, that, besides the neglect of the external appearance, there is also to be observed the circumstance that sometimes in psychical maladies the nails assume a peculiarly monstrous luxuriance with deformity. Besides, his remaining for a long time in the open air is to be considered, "for it is an actual experience that the hair, the more it is exposed to the influences of the rough weather and to the sun's rays, the more does it grow in hardness, and thus becomes like unto the feathers of an eagle.") </body></html>
