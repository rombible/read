This chapter relates the beginning of Daniel's last vision, which is continued to the end of the book. The time would be long before all would be accomplished; and much of it is not yet fulfilled. Christ appeared to Daniel in a glorious form, and it should engage us to think highly and honourably of him. Let us admire his condescension for us and our salvation. There remained no strength in Daniel. The greatest and best of men cannot bear the full discoveries of the Divine glory; for no man can see it, and live; but glorified saints see Christ as he is, and can bear the sight. How dreadful soever Christ may appear to those under convictions of sin, there is enough in his word to quiet their spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His body also was like the beryl - There is a very striking resemblance between the description here given and that of the Saviour as he appeared to John in Patmos, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>. See the notes at that passage. It contains, however, no description of the appearance of the body. "Beryl" is "a mineral of great hardness, occurring in green and bluish-green six-sided prisms. It is identical with the emerald, except that the latter has a purer and richer color. " - Dana, in Webster's Dictionary. The Hebrew word used here is &#1514;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  tarsh&#305;&#770;ysh "Tarshish, Tartessus," and properly refers to a country supposed to be on the south of Spain, a place where this mineral was probably found. This was situated between the mouths of the river Baetis, or Guadalquivir, and was a flourishing mart of the Phoenicians, <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-6.htm">Isaiah 23:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/23-10.htm">Isaiah 23:10</a>, ... - Gesenius. The name was given to this gem because it was brought from that place. The true meaning of the word, as applied to a gem, is supposed to be the chrysolite, that is, the topaz of the moderns. "Tarshish, the chrysolite," says Rosenmuller ("Mineralogy and Botany of the Bible," pp. 38, 39), "is a crystal-line precious stone of the quartz kind, of a glassy fracture. The prevailing color is yellowish-green, and pistachio-green of every variety and degree of shade, but always with a yellow and gold luster. It is completely diaphanous, and has a strong double refraction. Most commonly the chrysolite is found solid and in grains, or in angular pieces. The Hebrew word "Tarshish" denotes the south of Spain, the Tartessus of the Greeks and Romans, a place to which the Phoenicians traded even in the earliest ages. Probably the Phoenicians first brought the chrysolite from Spain to Syria, and it was on that account called Tarshish stone."<p>And his face as the appearance of lightning - Bright, shining. In <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a> it is, "And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength."

See the notes at that passage. The meaning is, that they were bright - like burnished metal. The Hebrew here is, "like the eye of brass;" then, as the word eye comes to denote the "face or countenance," the meaning is, "like the face or appearance of brass."

That is, that part of it which was not covered with the linen garment, and was seen, was like such a precious stone, said to be of an azure and sky colour, signifying he was the Lord from heaven; though, according to its name, it should be of a sea colour, greenish; and so, according to some, the beryl is. Cocceius thinks the sardonyx is meant, which is of a flesh colour, and so more fit to express the comeliness of a human body; the beryl, being of a different colour, seems not so apt to set forth the agreeable colour of a man. Braunius (p) is of opinion that the chrysolite is meant, a stone of a golden colour; and takes the sense to be, that such was the lustre of the golden girdle about his loins, that the rest of the parts of the body about it appeared as if all of gold: <p>and his face the appearance of lightning; exceeding bright, very dazzling to the eye, and striking terror to the mind; expressive of something very awful and majestic; and agrees well with Christ the sun of righteousness, whose face or countenance at his transfiguration on the mount, and when John saw him in a visionary way, was as the sun shineth in his strength, in the summer solstice, or at noonday, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>, from whom is all the light of knowledge and truth, of joy, peace, and comfort, of grace and glory; and which darts as swiftly and as powerfully from him as the rays of the sun, or as lightning from one end of the heaven to the other; and irradiates and illuminates as brightly and clearly: <p>and his eyes as lamps of fire; denoting his omniscience of all persons and things; and how piercing and penetrating his eyes are into the affairs of men and states, by whom they are clearly seen, and to whom they are exactly known; and how fierce and terrible his wrath is towards his enemies, and whose looks must inject dread and terror into them; see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>, <p>and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass; denoting his great strength for action, his stability and firmness, and the glory of his power, in trampling upon his enemies, and subduing them; especially as displayed in the redemption of his people, when his own arm wrought salvation for them; when he came travelling in the greatness of his strength, and trod the winepress of his father's wrath alone; when he set his feet on the necks of his and his people's enemies, and got an entire victory over sin, Satan, and the world, under whose feet they are, and ever will be subject: <p>and the voice of his words; not of the law, which was a voice of words, which they that heard entreated they might hear no more, and were very sonorous and dreadful; but rather of the Gospel, of the words and doctrines of grace and truth, which proceeded out of the mouth of Christ, and were such as were wondered at; which is a voice of love, grace, and mercy, sweet, charming, and alluring, powerful and efficacious; and the words of it are the words of peace, pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation; yea, this voice of Christ may take in his voice and words of commands, his ordinances and institutions, which he requires an obedience unto; and even his threatenings of wrath and ruin to wicked men, as well as his gracious and precious promises to his people: and this voice of his is said to be <p>like the voice of a multitude; of a great many men together; whose voice is heard a long way off, and is very strong and powerful: or, <p>as the voice of noise (q); which may be understood either of the noise of a multitude of men, or of the sea, or of many waters; see <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a> and may intend the power and efficacy of his words, whether in his doctrines, or in his judgments, in a way of grace and comfort, or of wrath and vengeance. <p>(p) De Vestitu Sacerdot.

In order to intimate the inward connection between the return of reason and the restoration to his sovereignty, in this verse the first element of his restoration is repeated from v. 31 (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>), and the second follows in connection with it in the simple manner of Semitic narrative, for which we in German (and English) use the closer connection: "when my understanding returned, then also my royal state and my glory returned." The passage beginning with &#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; is construed very differently by interpreters. Many co-ordinate &#1502;&#1500; &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; with &#1493;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;, and then regard &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; either as the nominative, "and then my kingly greatness, my glory and splendour, came to me again" (Hitzig), or unite &#1493;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; as the genitive with &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;: "and for the honour of my royalty, of my fame and my glory, it (my understanding) returned to me again" (v. Leng., Maur., Klief.). The first of these interpretations is grammatically inadmissible, since &#1500; cannot be a sign of the genitive; the other is unnecessarily artificial. We agree with Rosenmller and Kranichfeld in regarding &#1493;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497; as the subject of the passage. &#1492;&#1491;&#1512; [splendour, pomp] is the majestic appearance of the prince, which according to Oriental modes of conception showed itself in splendid dress; cf. <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21</a>. &#1494;&#1497;&#1493;, splendour (<a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>), is the shining colour or freshness of the appearance, which is lost by terror, anxiety, or illness, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9-10</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-28.htm">Daniel 7:28</a>. &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1512; as in <a href="/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>. In how far the return of the external dignified habitus was conducive to the honour of royalty, the king most fully shows in the second half of the verse, where he says that his counsellors again established him in his kingdom. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1488;, to seek, does not naturally indicate that the king was suffered, during the period of his insanity, to wander about in the fields and forests without any supervision, as Bertholdt and Hitzig think; but it denotes the seeking for one towards whom a commission has to be discharged, as <a href="/daniel/2-13.htm">Daniel 2:13</a>; thus, here, the seeking in order that they might transfer to him again the government. The "counsellors and great men" are those who had carried on the government during his insanity. &#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1504;&#1514;, on account of the accent. distinct., is Hophal pointed with Patach instead of Tsere, as the following &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1508;&#1514;. If Nebuchadnezzar, after his restoration to the kingdom, attained to yet more &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, greatness, than he had before, so he must have reigned yet a considerable time without our needing to suppose that he accomplished also great deeds.</body></html>
