Many New Testament predictions of the judgment to come, have plain allusion to this vision; especially Re 20:11,12. The Messiah is here called the Son of man; he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, and was found in fashion as a man, but he is the Son of God. The great event foretold in this passage, is Christ's glorious coming, to destroy every antichristian power, and to render his own kingdom universal upon earth. But ere the solemn time arrives, for manifesting the glory of God to all worlds in his dealings with his creatures, we may expect that the doom of each of us will be determined at the hour of our death; and before the end shall come, the Father will openly give to his incarnate Son, our Mediator and Judge, the inheritance of the nations as his willing subjects.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him - Streams of fire seemed to burst forth from his throne. Representations of this kind abound in the Scriptures to illustrate the majesty and glory of God. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>, "And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, and voices." <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>.<p>Thousand thousands ministered unto him - "A thousand of thousands;" that is, thousands multiplied a thousand times. The mind is struck with the fact that there are thousands present - and then the number seems as great as if those thousands were multiplied a thousand times. The idea is that there was an immense - a countless host. The reference here is to the angels, and God is often represented as attended with great numbers of these celestial beings when he comes down to our world. <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, "he came with ten thousands of saints;" that is, of holy ones. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, "the chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels." Compare Jde 1:14. The word "ministered" means that they attended on him.<p>And ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him - An innumerable host. These were not to be judged, but were attendants on him as he pronounced sentence. The judgment here referred to was not on the world at large, but on the beast, preparatory to giving the kingdom to the one who was like the Son of man <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<p>The judgment was set - That is, all the arrangements for a solemn act of judgment were made, and the process of the judgment commenced.<p>And the books were opened - As containing the record of the deeds of those who were to be judged. Compare <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>. The great Judge is represented as having before him the record of all the deeds on which judgment was to be pronounced, and to be about to pronounce sentence according to those deeds. The judgment here referred to seems to have been some solemn act on the part of God transferring the power over the world, from what had long swayed it, to the saints. As already remarked, the necessary interpretation of the passage does not require us to understand this of a literal and visible judgment - of a personal appearing of the "Ancient of days" - of a formal application to him by "one like the Son of man" <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> - or of a public and visible making over to him of a kingdom upon the earth. It is to be remembered that all this passed in vision before the mind of the prophet; that it is a symbolic representation; and that we are to find the fulfillment of this in some event changing the course of empire - putting a period to the power represented by the "beast" and the "horn," and causing that power to pass into other hands - producing a change as great on the earth as if such a solemn act of judgment were passed. The nature of the representation requires that we should look for the fulfillment of this in some great and momentous change in human affairs - some events that would take away the power of the "beast," and that would cause the dominion to pass into other hands. On the fulfillment, see the notes at <a href="/daniel/7-26.htm">Daniel 7:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. thousand &#8230; ministered unto him&#8212;so at the giving of the law (De 33:2; Ps 68:17; Heb 12:22; Jude 14).<p>ten &#8230; thousand before him&#8212;image from the Sanhedrim, in which the father of the consistory sat with his assessors on each side, in the form of a semicircle, and the people standing before him.<p>judgment was set&#8212;The judges sat (Re 20:4).<p>books &#8230; opened&#8212;(Re 20:12).

Or, "a river of fire" (s); which denotes the copious judgments of God, the abundance of them; the full flow of his wrath, and the fierceness of it; and also its rapidity, which cannot be resisted and stopped: <p>thousand thousands ministered unto him; attended upon him, waiting his orders, and ready to execute them; an innumerable company of angels, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>, <p>and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; to be judged by him; the numerous inhabitants of the several monarchies, with their kings; particularly all the antichristian states, and the worshippers of the beast, whom the whole world went after, <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>, <p>the judgment was set; that is, the court was set; the Judge was upon the bench, and all his assessors and apparitors about him, and that ministered to him: <p>and the books were opened; both to take the trial in writing, and to produce evidence against the criminals; the book of God's purposes and decrees concerning these beasts; the book of prophecies relating to them; the book of God's remembrance, and of their own consciences, with respect to the evils committed by them; and the book of records, statutes, and laws made in such cases; even the book of the Scriptures, which contains the revelation of the will of God. In some things there is a likeness between this and the last and future judgment, and in other things a disagreement; the Judge in both is a divine Person, the eternal God, omniscient, omnipotent, holy, just, and true, which is absolutely necessary for carrying on such a process; none but God over all is equal to such a work: in the last judgment, as in this, there will be thrones; the throne of God and of the Lamb, particularly a great white throne, a symbol of purity, justice, and equity, on which the Judge himself will sit, and execute judgment, from whose presence the earth and heaven will flee away; and besides, there will be other thrones for the martyrs of Jesus, and true professors of his name, to sit upon as spectators, witnesses, and approvers of the solemn procedure, and shall reign with Christ a thousand years: likewise the number of the persons judged, as here, will be very great, even innumerable; all, both small and great, as to age or dignity, will stand before the Judge, to be judged by him, and receive their sentence from him; and there will be books for that purpose, as here, even the same, and particularly the book of life, in which, if a man's name is not written, he will be cast into the lake of fire; see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, but in other things they differ; here the Judge is God the Father, the first Person in the Trinity, called the Ancient of days, distinguished from Christ, said to be like the Son of man; whereas the last and future judgment will be committed to the Son of God, the second Person, who is ordained Judge of quick and dead; and who will come a second time to judge the world in righteousness; and, though the description of the Ancient of days will agree well enough with him, he having the same glorious perfections his Father has, which qualify him for a Judge; see <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>, yet it is certain not he, but his divine Father, is intended: nor in the account of the future judgment is there any mention of "a fiery stream" issuing forth before him, as here, for the burning of the body of the beast; unless the lake of fire may be thought to answer to it, into which will be cast all such who have no part in the Lamb, nor a name in his book of life: however, the accounts of both are very awful and striking; and this may be considered as a type, example, presage, and pledge, of the future judgment; this will be at the beginning of the spiritual reign of Christ, when antichrist will be destroyed with the breath of his mouth, and the brightness of his coming; the judgment of the saints will be at the beginning of his personal reign, even of the quick and dead, those that will be found alive, and those that will be raised from the dead, at his appearing and kingdom; and the judgment of the wicked will be at the close of it, or at the end of the Millennium; see <a href="/revelation/20-5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a>. <p>(s)  "fluvius ignis", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> books were opened.</span><p>(u) That is, an infinite number of angels, who were ready to execute his commandment.<p>(x) This is meant of the first coming of Christ, when the will of God was plainly revealed by his Gospel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">a</span> <span class="bld">stream of fire</span> … <span class="ital">from before him</span>] For ‘from before,’ cf. <a href="/daniel/5-24.htm" title="Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.">Daniel 5:24</a>; and on <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a>.

Nebuchadnezzar' dominion did not, it is true, extend over the whole earth, but perhaps over the whole civilised world of Asia, over all the historical nations of his time; and in this sense it was a world-kingdom, and as such, "the prototype and pattern, the beginning and primary representative of all world-powers" (Klief.). &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, stat. emphat. for &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;; the reading &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; defended by Hitz. is senseless. If Daniel called him (Nebuchadnezzar) the golden head, the designation cannot refer to his person, but to the world-kingdom founded by him and represented in his person, having all things placed under his sway by God. Hitzig's idea, that Nebuchadnezzar is the golden head as distinguished from his successors in the Babylonian kingdom, is opposed by <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-39.htm">Daniel 2:39</a>, where it is said that after him (not another king, but) "another kingdom" would arise. That "Daniel, in the words, 'Thou art the golden head,' speaks of the Babylonian kingdom as of Nebuchadnezzar personally, while on the contrary he speaks of the other world-kingdoms impersonally only as of kingdoms, has its foundation in this, that the Babylonian kingdom personified in Nebuchadnezzar stood before him, and therefore could be addressed by the word thou, while the other kingdoms could not" (Klief.).</body></html>
