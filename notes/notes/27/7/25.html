It appears that the little horn, the Antichrist of the last days, or the beast, will be successful for a time in his blasphemies and persecutions, but in the end he will be destroyed. (See <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:">2Thessalonians 2:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Time and times and the dividing of time.—</span>This is frequently explained to mean three years and a half. Those who adopt this explanation assume that by “times” a dual is implied, which in Chaldee is represented by the plural. They next assume that by “a time” is meant one year, resting their assumption partly on <a href="/daniel/4-16.htm" title="Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.">Daniel 4:16</a>, and partly on a comparison of <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a> with <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm" title="And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given to him to continue forty and two months.">Revelation 13:5</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/11-2.htm" title="But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given to the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.">Revelation 11:2-3</a>. This gives a sum of three years and a half, which is interpreted either literally, or explained to mean half a sabbatical period, or half some divinely-appointed period symbolised by the number “seven.” According to the second interpretation, Daniel teaches us that the days of tribulation shall be shortened (<a href="/matthew/24-22.htm" title="And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.">Matthew 24:22</a>). But it may be questioned whether “years” are intended in <a href="/daniel/4-16.htm" title="Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.">Daniel 4:16</a>. Also the language in <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a> is very obscure. A more correct view of the prediction is that the reign of Antichrist will be divided into three periods—the first long, the second longer, the third shortest of all. It also appears that the last is to be the severest time of trial. It may be remarked that in Daniel 9 the seventy weeks are divided into three periods, forming a similar series, 7 + 62 + 1 = 70.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/daniel/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">He shall speak great words against the Most High — </span>Symmachus reads, <span class="ital">He shall speak great words, as the Most High; </span>“setting himself above all laws, divine and human: arrogating to himself godlike attributes, and titles of <span class="ital">holiness </span>and <span class="ital">infallibility; </span>exacting obedience to his ordinances and decrees, in preference to, and in open violation of, reason and Scripture; insulting men and blaspheming God.

The angel told Daniel plainly. He especially desired to know respecting the little horn, which made war with the saints, and prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rage of papal Rome against true Christians. St. John, in his visions and prophecies, which point in the first place at Rome, has plain reference to these visions. Daniel had a joyful prospect of the prevalence of God's kingdom among men. This refers to the second coming of our blessed Lord, when the saints shall triumph in the complete fall of Satan's kingdom. The saints of the Most High shall possess the kingdom for ever. Far be it from us to infer from hence, that dominion is founded on grace. It promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up; a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a kingdom of grace, the privileges and comforts of which shall be the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. But the full accomplishment will be in the everlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved. The gathering together the whole family of God will be a blessedness of Christ's coming.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus he said ... - That is, in explanation of the fourth symbol which appeared - the fourth beast, and of the events connected with his appearing. This explanation embraces the remainder of the chapter; and as the whole subject appeared difficult and momentous to Daniel before the explanation, so it may be said to be in many respects difficult, and in all respects momentous still. It is a question on which expositors of the Scriptures are by no means agreed, to what it refers, and whether it has been already accomplished, or whether it extends still into the future; and it is of importance, therefore, to determine, if possible, what is its true meaning. The two points of inquiry which are properly before us are, first, What do the words of explanation as used by the angel fairly imply - that is, what, according to the fair interpretation of these words, would be the course of events referred to, or what should we naturally expect to find as actually occurring on the earth in the fulfillment of this? and, secondly, To what events the prophecy is actually to be applied - whether to what has already occurred, or what is yet to occur; whether we can find anything in what is now past which would be an accomplishment of this, or whether it is to be applied to events a part of which are yet future? This will lead us into a statement of the points which it is affirmed would occur in regard to this kingdom: and then into an inquiry respecting the application.<p>What is fairly implied in the explanation of the angel? This would embrace the following points:<p>(1) There was to be a fourth kingdom on the earth: "the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth," <a href="/daniel/7-23.htm">Daniel 7:23</a>. This was to succeed the other three, symbolized by the lion, the bear, and the leopard. No further reference is made to them, but the characteristics of this are fully stated. Those characteristics, which have been explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, are, as here repeated,<p>(a) that it would be in important respects different from the others;<p>(b) that it would devour, or subdue the whole earth;<p>(c) that it would tread it down and break it in pieces; that is, it would be a universal dynasty, of a fierce and warlike character, that would keep the whole world subdued and subject by power.<p>(2) out of this sovereignty or dominion, ten powers would arise <a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a> : "and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise." Compare the notes at <a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>. That is, they would spring out of this one dominion, or it would be broken up into these minor sovereignties, yet all manifestly springing from the one kingdom, and wielding the same power. We should not naturally look for the fulfillment of this in a succession of kings, for that would have been symbolized by the beast itself representing the entire dominion or dynasty, but rather to a number of contemporaneous powers that had somehow sprung out of the one power, or that now possessed and wielded the power of that one dominion. If the kingdom here referred to should be broken up into such a number of powers, or if in any way these powers became possessed of this authority, and wielded it, such a fact would express what we are to expect to find in this kingdom.<p>(3) From the midst of these sovereignties or kingdoms there was to spring up another one of peculiar characteristics, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-25</a>. These characteristics are the following:<p>(a) That it would spring out of the others, or be, as it were, one form of the administration of the same power - as the eleventh horn sprang from the same source as the ten, and we are, therefore, to look for the exercise of this power somehow in connection with the same kingdom or dynasty.<p>(b) This would not spring up contemporaneously with the ten, but would arise "after them" - and we are to look for the power as in some sense succeeding them.<p>(c) It would be small at first - as was the horn <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, and we are to look for the fulfillment in some power that would be feeble at first.<p>(d) It would grow to be a mighty power for the little horn became so powerful as to pluck up three of the others <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, and it is said in the explanation <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, that he would subdue three of the kings.<p>(e) It would subdue "three kings;" that is, three of the ten, and we are to look for the fulfillment in some manifestation of that power by which, either literally three of them were overthrown, or by which about one-third of their power was taken away. The mention of the exact number of "three," however, would rather seem to imply that we are to expect some such exact fulfillment, or some prostration of three sovereignties by the new power that would arise.<p>(f) It would be proud, and ambitious, and particularly arrogant against God: "and he shall speak great words against the Most High," <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. The Chaldee here rendered against - &#1500;&#1510;&#1491;  letsad - means, literally, at, or against the part of it, and then against. Vulgate contra; Greek &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  pros. This would be fulfilled in one who would blaspheme God directly; or who would be rebellious against his government and authority; or who would complain of his administration and laws; or who would give utterance to harsh and reproachful words against his real claims. It would find a fulfillment obviously in an open opposer of the claims and the authority of the true God; or in one the whole spirit and bearing of whose pretensions might be fairly construed as in fact an utterance of great words against him.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. Three attributes of Antichrist are specified: (1) The highest worldly wisdom and civilization. (2) The uniting of the whole civilized world under his dominion. (3) Atheism, antitheism, and autotheism in its fullest development (1Jo 2:22). Therefore, not only is power taken from the fourth beast, as in the case of the other three, but God destroys it and the world power in general by a final judgment. The present external Christianity is to give place to an almost universal apostasy.<p>think&#8212;literally, "carry within him as it were the burden of the thought."<p>change times&#8212;the prerogative of God alone (Da 2:21); blasphemously assumed by Antichrist. The "times and laws" here meant are those of religious ordinance; stated times of feasts [Maurer]. Perhaps there are included the times assigned by God to the duration of kingdoms. He shall set Himself above all that is called God (2Th 2:4), putting his own "will" above God's times and laws (Da 11:36, 37). But the "times" of His wilfulness are limited for the elect's sake (Mt 24:22).<p>they&#8212;the saints.<p>given into his hand&#8212;to be persecuted.<p>time &#8230; times and &#8230; dividing of time&#8212;one year, two years, and half a year: 1260 days (Re 12:6, 14); forty-two months (Re 11:2, 3). That literally three and a half years are to be the term of Antichrist's persecution is favored by Da 4:16, 23, where the year-day theory would be impossible. If the Church, moreover, had been informed that 1260 years must elapse before the second advent, the attitude of expectancy which is inculcated (Lu 12:38; 1Co 1:7; 1Th 1:9, 10; 2Pe 3:12) on the ground of the uncertainty of the time, would be out of place. The original word for "time" denotes a stated period or set feast; or the interval from one set feast to its recurrence, that is, a year [Tregelles]; Le 23:4, "seasons"; Le 23:44, "feasts." The passages in favor of the year-day theory are Eze 4:6, where each day of the forty during which Ezekiel lay on his right side is defined by God as meaning a year. Compare Nu 14:34, where a year of wandering in the wilderness was appointed for each day of the forty during which the spies searched Canaan; but the days were, in these two cases, merely the type or reason for the years, which were announced as they were to be fulfilled. In the prophetic part of Nu 14:34 "years" are literal. If the year-day system was applied to them, they would be 14,400 years! In Eze 4:4-6, if day meant year, Ezekiel would have lain on his right side forty years! The context here in Da 7:24, 25, is not symbolical. Antichrist is no longer called a horn, but a king subduing three out of ten kings (no longer horns, Da 7:7, 8). So in Da 12:7, where "time, times, and half a time," again occurs, nothing symbolic occurs in the context. So that there is no reason why the three and a half years should be so. For the first four centuries the "days" were interpreted literally; a mystical meaning of the 1260 days then began. Walter Brute first suggested the year-day theory in the end of the fourteenth century. The seventy years of the Babylonian captivity foretold by Jeremiah (Jer 25:12; 29:10) were understood by Daniel (Da 9:2) as literal years, not symbolical, which would have been 25,200 years! [Tregelles]. It is possible that the year-day and day-day theories are both true. The seven (symbolical) times of the Gentile monarchies (Le 26:24) during Israel's casting off will end in the seven years of Antichrist. The 1260 years of papal misrule in the name of Christ may be represented by three and a half years of open Antichristianity and persecution before the millennium. Witnessing churches may be succeeded by witnessing individuals, the former occupying the longer, the latter the shorter period (Re 11:3). The beginning of the 1260 years is by Elliott set at A.D. 529 or 533, when Justinian's edict acknowledged Pope John II to be head of the Church; by Luther, at 606, when Phocas confirmed Justinian's grant. But 752 is the most likely date, when the temporal dominion of the popes began by Pepin's grant to Stephen II (for Zachary, his predecessor's recognition of his title to France), confirmed by Charlemagne. For it was then first that the little horn plucked up three horns, and so became the prolongation of the fourth secular kingdom [Newton]. This would bring us down to about A.D. 2000, or the seventh thousand millenary from creation. But Clinton makes about 1862 the seventh millenary, which may favor the dating from A.D. 529.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The numbers of Daniel and John seem to agree. Daniel was certainly prophetical in these things, and his prophecy reacheth to the end of times, even of antichrist’s reign. I will not deny but Antiochus might be a type and forerunner of antichrist, and did many things against the Jewish church, with craft, cruelty, and blasphemy; but he was no part of the fourth, but of the third beast; whereas Daniel here points mainly at the Roman power and persecution, especially by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the little horn, </span> which lasted to his ruin; after which it is clear the Lord Christ will reign in and over his saints much more gloriously; which the Jews will never be beaten from, because there are so many signal places in the prophets speaking of it yet unfulfilled, and in the Apocalypse, to the wise reader, after the beast and whore are destroyed, with all their supporters.

This, in all probability, is the period of 3½ years which is here intended. The 3½ years might also, however, be reckoned from the erection of the heathen altar in the court of the Temple, on the 15th of Chisleu, b.c. 168, to the death of Antiochus, which took place probably about the middle of 164 (see on <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm" title="And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.">Daniel 8:14</a>): the <span class="ital">terminus a quo</span> would then agree with that of the 1290 days in <a href="/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>, and the two periods would be (approximately) the same; but the six months before December 168 are more likely to have been included in the period of persecution, than the six months after December 165, when the victories of Judas had stemmed the tide of the persecution, and public worship had been resumed in the Temple.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom  and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaved, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him</span>. The versions do not present much of note in, ver. 25, save that the Greek versions imply that dominion over all is given to the oppressors. Throughout the Septuagint has traces of explanatory expansion. <span class="accented">He shall speak words against the Most High.</span> The word "against," <span class="accented">letzad</span>, is really "to the side of." This clause may refer to blasphemy against God, but more naturally refers to self-exaltation to a place alongside of God. <span class="accented">Shall wear out the saints of the Most High.</span> Persecute them, or maintain war against them; the natural meaning of the word is "afflict." <span class="accented">And shall think to change times and laws.</span> It ought not to be "laws," in the plural, but "law." It may refer to the marked changes introduced into the calendar by Julius Caesar. Certainly the law or constitution of the Roman state was changed by him. <span class="accented">And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</span> Who shall be given into his hands? It is usually assumed that it is the saints; but the LXX. asserts that it is universal dominion that is given into the hands of the oppressors. We have no right to assume that '<span class="accented">iddan</span>, "a time," means "a year;" it is really any defined time. Certainly it does approximate to the time during which the temple was polluted with heathen offerings; but it also coincides with equal accuracy to the campaigns of Vespasian and Titus against the Jews. Vespasian landed in Galilee in the beginning of A.D. , and Jerusalem fell on September 5, A.D. 70. There was thus, approximately, three years and a half occupied by this war. But "centuries" might also be meant. From the birth of our Lord, on whom the oppression was first exercised, till the accession of Constantine, was three centuries and a portion of a century. <span class="accented">The judgment shall sit.</span> Not necessarily the last judgment, but the evil that is being done comes before God for judgment. The taking away of the kingdom and dominion is immediately at the end of the period indicated by "a time and times and a dividing of time." The dominion was not taken away from Epiphanes then, nor from Vespasian; it did, however, pass from the heathenish empire when Constantine ascended the throne. At the same time, any such purely limited explanation is against the whole symbolic character of this vision. It is a period of time measured by "seven" <span class="accented">halves.</span> The times may receive their definition, not from the calendar, but from their spiritual import or dynamic content. The three years of our Lord's ministry is of more moment for the history of the race than all the millennia that preceded it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nebuchadnezzar commanded all the chief officers of the kingdom to be present at the solemn dedication of the image. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, he sent, viz., &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; or &#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; messengers, <a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10</a>; <a href="/esther/3-15.htm">Esther 3:15</a>.

Finally, all &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1504;&#1497;, rulers, i.e., governors of provinces, prefects, who were subordinate to the chief governor, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48-49</a>.<p>All these officers were summoned "to come (&#1502;&#1514;&#1488; from &#1488;&#1514;&#1488;, with the rejection of the initial )&#1488; to the dedication of the image." The objection of v. Leng. and Hitz., that this call would "put a stop to the government of the country," only shows their ignorance of the departments of the state-government, and by no means makes the narrative doubtful. The affairs of the state did not lie so exclusively in the hands of the presidents of the different branches of the government, as that their temporary absence should cause a suspension of all the affairs of government. &#1495;&#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is used of the dedication of a house (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>) as well as of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16</a>), and here undoubtedly denotes an act connected with religious usages, by means of which the image, when the great officers of the kingdom fell down before it, was solemnly consecrated as the symbol of the world-power and (in the heathen sense) of its divine glory. This act is described (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3-7</a>) in so far as the object contemplated rendered it necessary.<p>When all the great officers of state were assembled, a herald proclaimed that as soon as the sound of the music was heard, all who were present should, on pain of death by being cast into the fire, fall down before the image and offer homage to it; which they all did as soon as the signal was given. The form &#1511;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>, corresponds to the sing. &#1511;&#1488;&#1501; (<a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>) as it is written in Syr., but is read &#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;.

The expression &#1500;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-16.htm">Ezra 4:16</a>, is founded on &#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, the semi-vowel of the preceding sound being absorbed, as in the Syr. l-kebel.

The expression of the passive by means of a plural form of the active used impersonally, either participially or by 3rd pers. perf. plur., is found in Hebr., but is quite common in Chald.; cf. Ewald, Lehr. d. hebr. Spr. 128, b, and Winer, Chald. Gram. 49, 3. The proclamation of the herald refers not only to the officers who were summoned to the festival, but to all who were present, since besides the officers there was certainly present a great crowd of people from all parts of the kingdom, as M. Geier has rightly remarked, so that the assembly consisted of persons of various races and languages. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; denotes tribes of people, as the Hebr. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>, denotes the several tribes of Ishmael, and <a href="/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a> the separate tribes of the Midianites, and is thus not so extensive in its import as &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, peoples. &#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, corresponding to &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>, designates (vide <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-20.htm">Genesis 10:20</a>, <a href="/genesis/10-31.htm">Genesis 10:31</a>) communities of men of the same language, and is not a tautology, since the distinctions of nation and of language are in the course of history frequently found. The placing together of the three words denotes all nations, however they may have widely branched off into tribes with different languages, and expresses the sense that no one in the whole kingdom should be exempted from the command.

The great delight of the Babylonians in music and stringed instruments appears from <a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>, and is confirmed by the testimony of Herod. i. 191, and Curtius, <a href="/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1488;, horn, is the far-sounding tuba of the ancients, the &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; of the Hebr.; see under <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;, to hiss, to whistle, is the reed-flute, translated by the lxx and Theodot. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3be;, the shepherd's or Pan's pipes, which consisted of several reeds of different thicknesses and of different lengths bound together, and, according to a Greek tradition (Pollux, iv. 9, 15), was invented by two Medes. &#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514;&#1505; (according to the Kethiv; but the Keri and the Targ. and Rabbin. give the form &#1511;&#1514;&#1512;&#1505;) is the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, harp, for the Greek ending &#x3b9;&#x3c2; becomes &#x3bf;&#x3c2; in the Aramaic, as in many similar cases; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 1215. &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;, corresponding to the Greek &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, but a Syrian invention, is, according to Athen. iv. p. 175, a four-stringed instrument, having a sharp, clear tone; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 935. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; (in <a href="/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a> written with a  &#1496;instead of  &#1514;and in <a href="/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a> and <a href="/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a> pointed with a Tsere under the )&#1514; is the Greek &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, of which the Greek ending &#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; becomes abbreviated in the Aram. into &#1497;&#1503;  (cf. Ges. Thes. p. 1116). The word has no etymology in the Semitic. It was an instrument like a harp, which according to Augustin (on <a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a> [<a href="/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>] and <a href="/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a> [<a href="/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>) was distinguished from the cithara in this particular, that while the strings of the cithara passed over the sounding-board, those of the psalterium (or organon) were placed under it. Such harps are found on Egyptian (see Rosellini) and also on Assyrian monuments (cf. Layard, Ninev. and Bab., Table xiii. 4). &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, in <a href="/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a> &#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, is not derived from &#1505;&#1508;&#1503;, contignare, but is the Aramaic form of &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, bag-pipes, which is called in Italy at the present day sampogna, and derives its Greek name from the accord of two pipes placed in the bag; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 941. &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; signifies, not "song," but musical playing, from reemaz, to play the strings, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; and because the music of the instrument was accompanied with song, it means also the song accompanying the music. The explanation of &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; by singing stands here in opposition to the &#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, since all sorts of songs could only be sung after one another, but the herald speaks of the simultaneous rise of the sound. The limiting of the word also to the playing on a stringed instrument does not fit the context, inasmuch as wind instruments are also named. Plainly in the words &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; &#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; all the other instruments not particularly named are comprehended, so that &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; is to be understood generally of playing on musical instruments. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, in the same instant. The frequent pleonastic use in the later Aramaic of the union of the preposition with a suffix anticipating the following noun, whereby the preposition is frequently repeated before the noun, as e.g., &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>, has in the Bibl. Chald. generally a certain emphasis, for the pronominal suffix is manifestly used demonstratively, in the sense even this, even that.<p>Homage was commanded to be shown to the image under the pain of death to those who refused. Since "the dominion of Nebuchadnezzar was founded not by right, but by the might of conquest" (Klief.), and the homage which he commanded to be shown to the image was regarded not only as a proof of subjection under the power of the king, but comprehended in it also the recognition of his gods as the gods of the kingdom, instances of refusal were to be expected. In the demand of the king there was certainly a kind of religious oppression, but by no means, as Bleek, v. Leng., and other critics maintain, a religious persecution, as among heathen rulers Antiochus Epiphanes practised it. For so tolerant was heathenism, that it recognised the gods of the different nations; but all heathen kings required that the nations subdued by them should also recognise the gods of their kingdom, which they held to be more powerful than were the gods of the vanquished nations. A refusal to yield homage to the gods of the kingdom they regarded as an act of hostility against the kingdom and its monarch, while every one might at the same time honour his own national god. This acknowledgement, that the gods of the kingdom were the more powerful, every heathen could grant; and thus Nebuchadnezzar demanded nothing in a religious point of view which every one of his subjects could not yield. To him, therefore, the refusal of the Jews could not but appear as opposition to the greatness of his kingdom. But the Jews, or Israelites, could not do homage to the gods of Nebuchadnezzar without rejecting their faith that Jehovah alone was God, and that besides Him there were no gods. Therefore Nebuchadnezzar practised towards them, without, from his polytheistic standpoint, designing it, an intolerable religious coercion, which, whoever, is fundamentally different from the persecution of Judaism by Antiochus Epiphanes, who forbade the Jews on pain of death to serve their God, and endeavoured utterly to destroy the Jewish religion. - Regarding the structure of the fiery furnace, see under <a href="/daniel/3-22.htm">Daniel 3:22</a>.</body></html>
