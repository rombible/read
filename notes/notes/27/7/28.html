The angel told Daniel plainly. He especially desired to know respecting the little horn, which made war with the saints, and prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rage of papal Rome against true Christians. St. John, in his visions and prophecies, which point in the first place at Rome, has plain reference to these visions. Daniel had a joyful prospect of the prevalence of God's kingdom among men. This refers to the second coming of our blessed Lord, when the saints shall triumph in the complete fall of Satan's kingdom. The saints of the Most High shall possess the kingdom for ever. Far be it from us to infer from hence, that dominion is founded on grace. It promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up; a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a kingdom of grace, the privileges and comforts of which shall be the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. But the full accomplishment will be in the everlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved. The gathering together the whole family of God will be a blessedness of Christ's coming.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hitherto is the end of the matter - That is, the end of what I saw and heard. This is the sum of what was disclosed to the prophet, but he still says that he meditated on it with profound interest, and that he had much solicitude in regard to these great events. The words rendered hitherto, mean, so far, or thus far. The phrase "end of the matter," means "the close of the saying a thing;" that is, this was all the revelation which was made to him, and he was left to his own meditations respecting it.<p>As for me Daniel - So far as I was concerned; or so far as this had any effect on me. It was not unnatural, at the close of this remarkable vision, to state the effect that it had on himself.<p>My cogitations much troubled me - My thoughts in regard to it. It was a subject which he could not avoid reflecting on, and which could not but produce deep solicitude in regard to the events which were to occur. Who could look into the future without anxious and agitating thought? These events were such as to engage the profoundest attention; such as to fix the mind in solemn thought. Compare the notes at <a href="/revelation/5-4.htm">Revelation 5:4</a>.<p>And my countenance changed in me - The effect of these revelations depicted themselves on my countenance. The prophet does not say in what way - whether by making him pale, or careworn, or anxious, but merely that it produced a change in his appearance. The Chaldee is "brightness" - &#1494;&#1497;&#1493;  z&#305;&#770;yv - and the meaning would seem to be, that his bright and cheerful countenance was changed; that is, that his bright looks were changed; either by becoming pale (Gesenius, Lengerke), or by becoming serious and thoughtful.<p>But I kept the matter in my heart - I communicated to no one the cause of my deep and anxious thoughts. He hid the whole subject in his own mind, until he thought proper to make this record of what he had seen and heard. Perhaps there was no one to whom he could communicate the matter who would credit it; perhaps there was no one at court who would sympathize with him; perhaps he thought that it might savor of vanity if it were known; perhaps he felt that as no one could throw any new light on the subject, there would be no use in making it a subject of conversation; perhaps he felt so overpowered that he could not readily converse on it.<p>We are prepared now, having gone through with an exposition of this chapter, as to the meaning of the symbols, the words, and the phrases, to endeavor to ascertain what events are referred to in this remarkable prophecy, and to ask what events it was designed should be pourtrayed. And in reference to this there are but two opinions, or two classes of interpretations, that require notice: what refers it primarily and exclusively to Antiochus Epiphanes, and what refers it to the rise and character of the Papal power; what regards the fourth beast as referring to the empire of Alexander, and the little horn to Antiochus, and what regards the fourth beast as referring to the Roman empire, and the little horn to the Papal dominion. In inquiring which of these is the true interpretation, it will be proper, first, to consider whether it is applicable to Antiochus Epiphanes; secondly, whether it in fact finds a fulfillment in the Roman empire and the Papacy; and, thirdly, if such is the proper application, what are we to look for in the future in what remains unfulfilled in regard to the prophecy.<p>I. The question whether it is applicable to the case of Antiochus Epiphanes. A large class of interpreters, of the most respectable character, among whom are Lengerke, Maurer, Prof. Stuart (Hints on the Interpretation of Prophecy, p. 86, following; also Com. on Daniel, pp. 205-211), Eichhorn, Bertholdt, Bleek, and many others, suppose that the allusion to Antiochus is clear, and that the primary, if not the exclusive, reference to the prophecy is to him. Professor Stuart (Hints, p. 86) says, "The passage in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> is so clear as to leave no reasonable room for doubt." "In <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, the rise of Antiochus Epiphanes is described; for the fourth beast is, beyond all reasonable doubt, the divided Grecian dominion which succeeded the reign of Alexander the Great. From this dynasty springs Antiochus, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a>, who is most graphically described in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> 'as one who shall speak great words against the most High,' etc."<p>The facts in regard to Antiochus, so far as they are necessary to be known in the inquiry, are briefly these: Antiochus Epiphanes (the Illustrios, a name taken on himself, Prideaux, iii. 213), was the son of Antiochus the Great, but succeeded his brother, Seleucus Philopator, who died 176 b.c. Antiochus reigned over Syria, the capital of which was Antioch, on the Oronres, from 176 b.c. to 164 b.c. His character, as that of a cruel tyrant, and a most bloodthirsty and bitter enemy of the Jews, is fully detailed in the first and second book of Maccabees. Compare also Prideaux, Con. vol. iii.-213-234. The facts in the case of Antiochus, so far as they are supposed to bear on the application of the prophecy before us, are thus stated by Prof. Stuart (Hints on the Interpretation of Prophecy, pp. 89, 90): "In the year 168 before Christ, in the month of May, Antiochus Epiphanes was on his way to attack Egypt, and he detached Apollonius, one of his military confidants, with 22,000 soldiers, in order to subdue and plunder Jerusalem. The mission was executed with entire success. A horrible slaughter was made of the men at Jerusalem, and a large portion of the women and children, being made captives, were sold and treated as slaves. The services of the temple were interrupted, and its joyful feasts were turned into mourning, 1 Macc. 1:37-39. Soon after this the Jews in general were compelled to eat swine's flesh, and to sacrifice to idols. In December of that same year, the temple was profaned by introducing the statue of Jupiter Olympius; and on the 25th of that month sacrifices were offered to that idol on the altar of Jehovah. Just three years after this last event, namely, December 25, 165 b.c., the temple was expurgated by Judas Maccabeus, and the worship of Jehovah restored.<p>Thus, three years and a half, or almost exactly this period, passed away, while Antiochus had complete possession and control of everything in and around Jerusalem and the temple. It may be noted, also, that just three years passed, from the time when the profanation of the temple was carried to its greatest height - namely, by sacrificing to the statue of Jupiter Olympius on the altar of Jehovah, down to the time when Judas renewed the regular worship. I mention this last circumstance in order to account for the three years of Antiochus' profanations, which are named as the period of them in Joseptus, Ant. xii. 7, Section 6. This period tallies exactly with the time during which the profanation as consummated was carried on, if we reckon down to the period when the temple worship was restored by Judas Maceabeus. But in Prooem. ad Bell. Jud. Section 7, and Bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/1.htm">Jude 1</a>. 1, Section 1, Josephus reckons three years and a half as the period during which Antiochus ravaged Jerusalem and Judea."<p>In regard to this statement, while the general facts are correct, there are some additional statements which should be made, to determine as to its real bearing on the case. The act of detaching Apollonius to attack Jerusalem was not, as is stated in this extract, when Antiochus was on his way to Egypt, but was on his return from Egypt, and was just two years after Jerusalem had been taken by Antiochus. - Prideaux, iii. 239. The occasion of his detaching Apollonius, was that Antiochus was enraged because he had been defeated in Egypt by the Romans, and resolved to vent all his wrath upon the Jews, who at that time had given him no particular offence. When, two years before, Antiochus had himself taken Jerusalem, he killed forty thousand persons; he took as many captives, and sold them for slaves; he forced himself into the temple, and entered the most holy place; he caused a great sow to be offered on the altar of burnt-offering, to show his contempt for the temple and the Jewish religion; he sprinkled the broth over every part of the temple for the purpose of polluting it; he plundered the temple of the altar of incense, the showbread table, and the golden candlestick, and then returned to Antioch, having appointed Philip, a Phrygian, a man of a cruel and barbarous temper, to be governor of the Jews. - Prideaux, iii.231.<p>When Apollonius again attacked the city, two years afterward, he waited quietly until the Sabbath, and then made his assault. He filled the city with blood, set it on fire, demolished the houses, pulled down the walls, built a strong fortress over against the temple, from which the garrison could fall on all who should attempt to go to worship. From this time, "the temple became deserted, and the daily sacrifices were omitted," until the service was restored by Judas Maccabeus, three years and a half after. The time during which this continued was, in fact, just three years and a half, until Judas MaccaUcus succeeded in expelling the pagan from the temple and from Jerusalem, when the temple was purified, and was solemnly reconsecrated to the worship of God. See Prideaux, Con. iii. 240, 241, and the authorities there cited.<p>Now, in reference to this interpretation, supposing that the prophecy relates to Antiochus, it must be admitted that there are coincidences which are remarkable, and it is on the ground of these coincidences that the prophecy has been applied to him. These circumstances are such as the following:<p>(a) The general character of the authority that would exist as denoted by the "little horn," as that of severity and cruelty. None could be better fitted to represent that than the character of Antiochus Epiptianes. Compare Prideaux, Con. iii. 213, 214.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. cogitations &#8230; troubled me&#8212;showing that the Holy Spirit intended much more to be understood by Daniel's words than Daniel himself understood.

Leng. and Hitz., that this call would "put a stop to the government of the country," only shows their ignorance of the departments of the state-government, and by no means makes the narrative doubtful. The affairs of the state did not lie so exclusively in the hands of the presidents of the different branches of the government, as that their temporary absence should cause a suspension of all the affairs of government. &#1495;&#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; is used of the dedication of a house (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>) as well as of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-5.htm">2 Chronicles 7:5</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16</a>), and here undoubtedly denotes an act connected with religious usages, by means of which the image, when the great officers of the kingdom fell down before it, was solemnly consecrated as the symbol of the world-power and (in the heathen sense) of its divine glory. This act is described (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3-7</a>) in so far as the object contemplated rendered it necessary.<p>When all the great officers of state were assembled, a herald proclaimed that as soon as the sound of the music was heard, all who were present should, on pain of death by being cast into the fire, fall down before the image and offer homage to it; which they all did as soon as the signal was given. The form &#1511;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>, corresponds to the sing. &#1511;&#1488;&#1501; (<a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>) as it is written in Syr., but is read &#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;. The Masoretes substitute for it in the Talm. The common form &#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503;; cf. Frst, Lehrgb. der aram. Idiom. p. 161, and Luzzatto, Elem. Gram. p. 33. The expression &#1500;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-16.htm">Ezra 4:16</a>, is founded on &#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, the semi-vowel of the preceding sound being absorbed, as in the Syr. l-kebel. On &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1494;&#1488;, herald, and on the form &#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, see under <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a>. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, they say, for "it is said to you." The expression of the passive by means of a plural form of the active used impersonally, either participially or by 3rd pers. perf. plur., is found in Hebr., but is quite common in Chald.; cf. Ewald, Lehr. d. hebr. Spr. 128, b, and Winer, Chald. Gram. 49, 3. The proclamation of the herald refers not only to the officers who were summoned to the festival, but to all who were present, since besides the officers there was certainly present a great crowd of people from all parts of the kingdom, as M. Geier has rightly remarked, so that the assembly consisted of persons of various races and languages. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; denotes tribes of people, as the Hebr. &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>, denotes the several tribes of Ishmael, and <a href="/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a> the separate tribes of the Midianites, and is thus not so extensive in its import as &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, peoples. &#1500;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, corresponding to &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>, designates (vide <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-20.htm">Genesis 10:20</a>, <a href="/genesis/10-31.htm">Genesis 10:31</a>) communities of men of the same language, and is not a tautology, since the distinctions of nation and of language are in the course of history frequently found. The placing together of the three words denotes all nations, however they may have widely branched off into tribes with different languages, and expresses the sense that no one in the whole kingdom should be exempted from the command. It is a mode of expression (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>, 31[4:1], and <a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>[25]) specially characterizing the pathetic style of the herald and the official language of the world-kingdom, which Daniel also (<a href="/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>) makes use of, and which from the latter passage is transferred to the Apocalypse, and by the union of these passages in Daniel with <a href="/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a> is increased to &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in Isa.), &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;,&#769; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-7.htm">Revelation 13:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>).<p>In the same passage &#1494;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a> (cf. also <a href="/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8</a>), is interchanged with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1488;, at the time (<a href="/daniel/3-5.htm">Daniel 3:5</a> and <a href="/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>); but it is to be distinguished from &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, at the same moment, <a href="/daniel/3-6.htm">Daniel 3:6</a> and <a href="/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1488; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; has in the Bib. Chald. only the meaning instant, moment, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>, <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>, and acquires the signification short time, hour, first in the Targ. and Rabbin. In the enumeration also of the six names of the musical instruments with the addition: and all kinds of music, the pompous language of the world-ruler and of the herald of his power is well expressed. Regarding the Greek names of three of these instruments see p. 507. The great delight of the Babylonians in music and stringed instruments appears from <a href="/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>, and is confirmed by the testimony of Herod. i. 191, and Curtius, <a href="/daniel/3-3.htm">Daniel 3:3</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1488;, horn, is the far-sounding tuba of the ancients, the &#1511;&#1512;&#1503; or &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; of the Hebr.; see under <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1511;, to hiss, to whistle, is the reed-flute, translated by the lxx and Theodot. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3be;, the shepherd's or Pan's pipes, which consisted of several reeds of different thicknesses and of different lengths bound together, and, according to a Greek tradition (Pollux, iv. 9, 15), was invented by two Medes. &#1511;&#1497;&#1514;&#1514;&#1505; (according to the Kethiv; but the Keri and the Targ. and Rabbin. give the form &#1511;&#1514;&#1512;&#1505;) is the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, harp, for the Greek ending &#x3b9;&#x3c2; becomes &#x3bf;&#x3c2; in the Aramaic, as in many similar cases; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 1215. &#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488;, corresponding to the Greek &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, but a Syrian invention, is, according to Athen. iv. p. 175, a four-stringed instrument, having a sharp, clear tone; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 935. &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1504;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; (in <a href="/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7</a> written with a  &#1496;instead of  &#1514;and in <a href="/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a> and <a href="/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a> pointed with a Tsere under the )&#1514; is the Greek &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, of which the Greek ending &#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; becomes abbreviated in the Aram. into &#1497;&#1503;  (cf. Ges. Thes. p. 1116). The word has no etymology in the Semitic. It was an instrument like a harp, which according to Augustin (on <a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a> [<a href="/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>] and <a href="/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a> [<a href="/psalms/42-4.htm">Psalm 42:4</a>) was distinguished from the cithara in this particular, that while the strings of the cithara passed over the sounding-board, those of the psalterium (or organon) were placed under it. Such harps are found on Egyptian (see Rosellini) and also on Assyrian monuments (cf. Layard, Ninev. and Bab., Table xiii. 4). &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, in <a href="/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a> &#1505;&#1497;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;, is not derived from &#1505;&#1508;&#1503;, contignare, but is the Aramaic form of &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, bag-pipes, which is called in Italy at the present day sampogna, and derives its Greek name from the accord of two pipes placed in the bag; cf. Ges. Thes. p. 941. &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; signifies, not "song," but musical playing, from reemaz, to play the strings, &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; and because the music of the instrument was accompanied with song, it means also the song accompanying the music. The explanation of &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; by singing stands here in opposition to the &#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, since all sorts of songs could only be sung after one another, but the herald speaks of the simultaneous rise of the sound. The limiting of the word also to the playing on a stringed instrument does not fit the context, inasmuch as wind instruments are also named. Plainly in the words &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; &#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; all the other instruments not particularly named are comprehended, so that &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1488; is to be understood generally of playing on musical instruments. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, in the same instant. The frequent pleonastic use in the later Aramaic of the union of the preposition with a suffix anticipating the following noun, whereby the preposition is frequently repeated before the noun, as e.g., &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>, has in the Bibl. Chald. generally a certain emphasis, for the pronominal suffix is manifestly used demonstratively, in the sense even this, even that.<p>Homage was commanded to be shown to the image under the pain of death to those who refused. Since "the dominion of Nebuchadnezzar was founded not by right, but by the might of conquest" (Klief.), and the homage which he commanded to be shown to the image was regarded not only as a proof of subjection under the power of the king, but comprehended in it also the recognition of his gods as the gods of the kingdom, instances of refusal were to be expected. In the demand of the king there was certainly a kind of religious oppression, but by no means, as Bleek, v. Leng., and other critics maintain, a religious persecution, as among heathen rulers Antiochus Epiphanes practised it. For so tolerant was heathenism, that it recognised the gods of the different nations; but all heathen kings required that the nations subdued by them should also recognise the gods of their kingdom, which they held to be more powerful than were the gods of the vanquished nations. A refusal to yield homage to the gods of the kingdom they regarded as an act of hostility against the kingdom and its monarch, while every one might at the same time honour his own national god. This acknowledgement, that the gods of the kingdom were the more powerful, every heathen could grant; and thus Nebuchadnezzar demanded nothing in a religious point of view which every one of his subjects could not yield. To him, therefore, the refusal of the Jews could not but appear as opposition to the greatness of his kingdom. But the Jews, or Israelites, could not do homage to the gods of Nebuchadnezzar without rejecting their faith that Jehovah alone was God, and that besides Him there were no gods. Therefore Nebuchadnezzar practised towards them, without, from his polytheistic standpoint, designing it, an intolerable religious coercion, which, whoever, is fundamentally different from the persecution of Judaism by Antiochus Epiphanes, who forbade the Jews on pain of death to serve their God, and endeavoured utterly to destroy the Jewish religion. - Regarding the structure of the fiery furnace, see under <a href="/daniel/3-22.htm">Daniel 3:22</a>.</body></html>
