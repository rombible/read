The angel told Daniel plainly. He especially desired to know respecting the little horn, which made war with the saints, and prevailed against them. Here is foretold the rage of papal Rome against true Christians. St. John, in his visions and prophecies, which point in the first place at Rome, has plain reference to these visions. Daniel had a joyful prospect of the prevalence of God's kingdom among men. This refers to the second coming of our blessed Lord, when the saints shall triumph in the complete fall of Satan's kingdom. The saints of the Most High shall possess the kingdom for ever. Far be it from us to infer from hence, that dominion is founded on grace. It promises that the gospel kingdom shall be set up; a kingdom of light, holiness, and love; a kingdom of grace, the privileges and comforts of which shall be the earnest and first-fruits of the kingdom of glory. But the full accomplishment will be in the everlasting happiness of the saints, the kingdom that cannot be moved. The gathering together the whole family of God will be a blessedness of Christ's coming.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I came near unto one of them that stood by - That is, to one of the angels who appeared to stand near the throne. <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>.

It was natural for Daniel to suppose that the angels who were seen encircling the throne would be able to give him information on the subject, and the answers which Daniel received show that he was not mistaken in his expectation. God has often employed angels to communicate important truths to men, or has made them the medium of communicating his will. Compare <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>.<p>So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things - He explained the meaning of the symbols, so that Daniel understood them. It would seem probable that Daniel has not recorded all that the angel communicated respecting the vision, but he has preserved so much that we may understand its general signification. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. body&#8212;literally, "sheath": the body being the "sheath" of the soul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto one of them that stood by; </span> that is, to an angel that ministered, <span class="bld"><a href="/zechariah/3-4.htm" title="And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.

For the part of interpreter taken by an angel in a vision, cf. <a href="/zechariah/1-7.htm" title="On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,">Zechariah 1:7</a> to <a href="/zechariah/6-8.htm" title="Then cried he on me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.">Zechariah 6:8</a> <span class="ital">passim</span>; and the Apocalypses of Enoch and 2 Esdras. It is characteristic of the later prophecies: in the visions of the earlier prophets (as Amos 7, 8, Isaiah 6, Jeremiah 1, Ezekiel 2-5, 8, 9, &c.), Jehovah speaks Himself to the prophet. We have the transition in Ezekiel 40-48, where an angel conducts the prophet, and usually explains things to him (<a href="/context/ezekiel/40-3.htm" title="And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate....">Ezekiel 40:3-4</a>, &c.), though sometimes Jehovah also speaks Himself (<a href="/context/ezekiel/43-7.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the middle of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places....">Ezekiel 43:7-9</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/44-2.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.">Ezekiel 44:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-5.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.">Ezekiel 44:5</a>, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of all this</span>] better, <span class="bld">concerning</span> <span class="ital">all this</span> (R.V.).<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="/daniel/2-42.htm">Daniel 2:42</a> the same is aid of the toes of the feet, and in <a href="/daniel/2-43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a> the comparison to iron and clay is defined as the mixture of these two component parts. As the iron denotes the firmness of the kingdom, so the clay denotes its brittleness. The mixing of iron with clay represents the attempt to bind the two distinct and separate materials into one combined whole as fruitless, and altogether in vain. The mixing of themselves with the seed of men (<a href="/daniel/2-43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>), most interpreters refer to the marriage politics of the princes. They who understand by the four kingdoms the monarchy of Alexander and his followers, think it refers to the marriages between the Seleucidae and the Ptolemies, of which indeed there is mention made in <a href="/daniel/11-6.htm">Daniel 11:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-17.htm">Daniel 11:17</a>, but not here; while Hofm. thinks it relates to marriages, such as those of the German Kaiser Otto II and the Russian Grand-Duke Wladimir with the daughters of the Kaiser of Eastern Rome. But this interpretation is rightly rejected by Klief., as on all points inconsistent with the text. The subject to &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; is not the kings, of whom mention is made neither in <a href="/daniel/2-43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a> nor previously. For the two feet as well as the ten toes denote not kings, but parts of the fourth kingdom; and even in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, by &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;, not kings in contradistinction to the kingdoms, but the representatives of the parts of the kingdom denoted by the feet and the toes as existing contemporaneously, are to be understood, from which it cannot rightly be concluded in any way that kings is the subject to &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (shall mingle themselves).<p>As, in the three preceding kingdoms, gold, silver, and brass represent the material of these kingdoms, i.e., their peoples and their culture, so also in the fourth kingdom iron and clay represent the material of the kingdoms arising out of the division of this kingdom, i.e., the national elements out of which they are constituted, and which will and must mingle together in them. If, then, the "mixing themselves with the seed of men" points to marriages, it is only of the mixing of different tribes brought together by external force in the kingdom by marriages as a means of amalgamating the diversified nationalities. But the expression is not to be limited to this, although &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>, occurs of the mixing of the holy nation with the heathen by marriage. The peculiar expression &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, the seed of men, is not of the same import as &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1514;, but is obviously chosen with reference to the following contrast to the divine Ruler, <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>., so as to place (Kran.) the vain human endeavour of the heathen rulers in contrast with the doings of the God of heaven; as in <a href="/jeremiah/31-27.htm">Jeremiah 31:27</a> &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; is occasioned by the contrast of &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;. The figure of mixing by seed is derived from the sowing of the field with mingled seed, and denotes all the means employed by the rulers to combine the different nationalities, among which the connubium is only spoken of as the most important and successful means.<p>But this mixing together will succeed just as little as will the effort to bind together into one firm coherent mass iron and clay. The parts mixed together will not cleave to each other. Regarding &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, see under <a href="/daniel/2-20.htm">Daniel 2:20</a>.</body></html>
