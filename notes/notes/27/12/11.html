The language used respecting the “abomination” is almost verbally the same as that in <a href="/daniel/8-3.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-11.htm" title="Yes, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.">Daniel 8:11</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a>, and prevents us from arriving at any other conclusion. The great and apparently insoluble difficulty is the relation which the 1,290 or the 1,335 days occupy with regard to the 2,300 days, or the time, times, and the dividing of a time. Assuming that these four periods all commence at the same epoch (see Note on <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm" title="And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.">Daniel 8:14</a>), the death of Antiochus closes the 1,290 days, and the 1,335 days point to some event which occurred forty-five days, or a month and a half, later. The principal objection to this view is that the exact date of the death of Antiochus is uncertain, and therefore all calculations based upon the precise day of his death must be untrustworthy. It is obvious that neither of the two periods mentioned in this and the following verse can be made to agree with three years and a half without setting the rules of arithmetic at defiance. Also the obscurity which rests over the greater portion of the history of Israel should guard us against assuming that we can explain all the contents of the last three chapters by means of what occurred in those times, and also against assuming our historical facts from Daniel, and then making use of them to illustrate his prophecies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/daniel/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days....">Daniel 12:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away — </span>It is here declared, that the whole time that these calamities would last, should run somewhat beyond <span class="ital">a time, times, and half a time, </span>namely, thirty days beyond it; for <span class="ital">a time, times, and a half </span>signify only twelve hundred and sixty days, whereas here twelve hundred and ninety is mentioned as the term of duration; for which space of time, but not longer, the daily sacrifice should be taken away, or prohibited, and an idol be placed in the temple. <span class="ital">Blessed is he that waiteth, </span>or <span class="ital">survives, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days — </span>This period is forty-five days longer than the term last mentioned, or the twelve hundred and ninety days; and, if taken literally, and interpreted of the time of Antiochus’s persecution, is supposed to be spoken of the time of his death, when the Jewish nation was not only delivered from their calamities, but also from all fear of their being renewed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Those who extend these predictions to the times of Popery and Mohammedanism, suppose that the expressions made use of to describe Antiochus’s persecutions are here applied to the desolations made by antichrist, of which those made by Antiochus were a figure: see note on <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm" title="And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.">Daniel 8:14</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm" title="And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.">Daniel 11:36</a>. And indeed they are expressions evidently applicable to different events, and have been accomplished at different times. “The <span class="ital">setting up of the abomination of desolation,” </span>says Bishop Newton, “appears to be a general phrase, and comprehensive of various events. It is applied by the writer of the first book of Maccabees, chap. <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-54.htm" title="Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;">1Ma 1:54</a>, to the profanation of the temple by Antiochus, and his setting up the image of Jupiter Olympus upon the altar of God. It is applied by our Saviour, <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>, to the destruction of the city and temple by the Romans, under the conduct of Titus. It may, for the same reason, be applied to the Emperor Adrian’s building a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus, in the same place where the temple of God had stood; and to the misery of the Jews, and the desolation of Judea that followed. It may, with equal justice, be applied to the Mohammedans’ invading and desolating Christendom, and converting the churches into mosques: and this latter event seems to have been particularly intended in this passage. If this interpretation be true, the religion of Mohammed will prevail in the East for the space of twelve hundred and sixty years, and then a great and glorious revolution will follow; perhaps the restoration of the Jews, perhaps the destruction of antichrist: but another still greater and more glorious will succeed; and what can this be so probably as the full conversion of the Gentiles to the church of Christ, and the beginning of the millennium, or the reign of the saints upon earth? For, <a href="/daniel/12-12.htm" title="Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.">Daniel 12:12</a>, <span class="ital">Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. </span>Here, then, are three different periods assigned, twelve hundred and sixty, twelve hundred and ninety, and thirteen hundred and thirty-five years; but what is the precise time of their beginning, and consequently of their ending, as well as what are the great and signal events which will take place at the end of each period, we can only conjecture, time alone can with certainty discover. It is, indeed, no wonder, that we cannot fully understand and explain these things: for, as the angel said to Daniel himself, though <span class="ital">many should run to and fro, </span>should inquire and examine into these things, and thereby <span class="ital">knowledge </span>should <span class="ital">be increased; </span>yet the full understanding of them is reserved for the <span class="ital">time of the end, </span>to which time the words are <span class="ital">closed up and sealed. </span>But, however, the great uncertainty of these events, which remain yet to be fulfilled, cannot shake the credit and certainty of those which have already been accomplished.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Upon the whole, what an amazing prophecy is this! comprehending so many various events, and extending through so many successive ages, from the first establishment of the Persian empire, above five hundred and thirty years before Christ, to the general resurrection! And the farther it extends, and the more it comprehends, the more amazing and the more divine it must appear. What stronger and more convincing proofs can be given or required of a divine providence, and a divine revelation; that there is a God who directs and orders the transactions of the world; and that Daniel was a prophet divinely inspired by him, <span class="ital">a man greatly beloved, </span>as he is often addressed by an angel! Our blessed Saviour hath bestowed upon him the appellation of <span class="ital">Daniel the prophet, </span><a href="/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>, and that is authority sufficient for any Christian; but, in the course of these notes, such instances and attestations of his being a prophet have been produced as an infidel cannot deny, or if he denies cannot disprove. In short, we see how well Daniel deserves the character which his contemporary, Ezekiel, hath given of him, <a href="/context/ezekiel/14-14.htm" title="Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD....">Ezekiel 14:14-20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-3.htm" title="Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from you:">Ezekiel 28:3</a>, for his <span class="ital">piety </span>and <span class="ital">wisdom; </span>and these usually go together: for, as the angel says above, <a href="/daniel/12-10.htm" title="Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.">Daniel 12:10</a>, <span class="ital">None of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.

It signifies 1260 prophetic days or years, beginning from the time when the power of the holy people should be scattered. The imposture of Mohammed, and the papal usurpation, began about the same time; and these were a twofold attack upon the church of God. But all will end well at last. All opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down, and holiness and love will triumph, and be in honour, to eternity. The end, this end, shall come. What an amazing prophecy is this, of so many varied events, and extending through so many successive ages, even to the general resurrection! Daniel must comfort himself with the pleasing prospect of his own happiness in death, in judgment, and to eternity. It is good for us all to think much of going away from this world. That must be our way; but it is our comfort that we shall not go till God calls us to another world, and till he has done with us in this world; till he says, Go thou thy way, thou hast done thy work, therefore now, go thy way, and leave it to others to take thy place. It was a comfort to Daniel, and is a comfort to all the saints, that whatever their lot is in the days of their lives, they shall have a happy lot in the end of the days. And it ought to be the great care and concern of every one of us to secure this. Then we may well be content with our present lot, and welcome the will of God. Believers are happy at all times; they rest in God by faith now, and a rest is reserved for them in heaven at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And from the time - Though the angel had said <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-9.htm">Daniel 12:9</a> that his communication was closed, and that he imparted all that he was commissioned to communicate to Daniel, yet, as it would seem, in reply to the earnest request of Daniel, he volunteers an additional statement, in regard to certain important periods that were to occur in the future. The language, however, is very obscure; and it would appear, from <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13</a>, that the angel scarcely expected that Daniel would understand it. The statement relates to certain periods that would succeed the time when the daily sacrifice would be taken away. Two such periods are mentioned as marking important epochs in the future.<p>That the daily sacrifice shall be taken away - This is the point of reckoning - the terminus a quo. The "taking away of the daily sacrifice" refers, undoubtedly, to some act, or some state of things, by which it would be made to cease; by which the daily offerings at Jerusalem would be either temporarily suspended or totally abolished. See the notes at <a href="/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>. The language here is applicable to either of two events: to the act of Antiochus, causing the daily sacrifice to cease in Jerusalem <a href="/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>, or to the final closing of those sacrifices by the death of the Messiah as the great offering to whom they referred, and the destruction of the temple and the altar by the Romans, <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>. The view taken in the interpretation of this passage will depend on the question to which of these there is allusion here by the angel, or whether there is an allusion to both. The language evidently is applicable to both, and might be employed with reference to either.<p>And the abomination that maketh desolate set up - See these words explained in the notes at <a href="/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>. The same remark may be made here which was made respecting the previous expression - that the language is applicable to two quite distinct events, and events which were separated by a long interval of time: to the act of Antiochus in setting up an image of Jupiter in the temple, and to a similar act on the part of the Romans when the temple was finally destroyed. The view which is taken of the time referred to here will depend on the question which of these is to be regarded as the stand-point or the terminus a quo, or whether the language is designedly so used that an important epoch was to occur in both cases within a specified period after these events. On these points there has been great diversity of opinion.<p>There shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days - If this is to be taken literally, it would be three years and two hundred and ten days, reckoning the year at 360 days, and is thirty days more than the three years and a half referred to in <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>. Prof. Stuart, who supposes that the time is to be taken literally, and that the passage refers exclusively to Antiochus Epiphanes, explains the application of the language in the following manner: "Antiochus took away the daily sacrifice as is here declared. This was in the latter part of May, 168 b.c. Profane history does not indeed give us the day, but it designates the year and the season. As we have already seen (compare the extract copied from Prof. Stuart on <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-28</a>), about three and a half years elapsed, after the temple worship was entirely broken up, before Judas Maccabeus expurgated the temple and restored its rites. The terminus ad quem is not mentioned in the verse now before us; but still it is plainly implied. The end of the 1290 days must, of course, be marked by some signal event, just as the commencement of them is so marked. And as the suppression of the temple rites constitutes the definitive mark of the commencement, so it would seem plain that the restoration of the same rites must mark the conclusion of the period which is designated.<p>The 'time of the end,' i. e., the period at the close of which the persecutions of Antiochus would cease, is distinctly adverted to in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30-35</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a>. The nature of the case, in the verse before us, shows that the same period is tacitly referred to in the words of the speaker. No doubt remains that his march (the march of Antiochus) from Antioch to Egypt, for hostile purposes, was in the spring of the year 168 b.c. He was delayed for some time on this march by ambassadors from Egypt, who met him in Coelo-Syria. Very naturally, therefore, we may conclude that he arrived opposite Jerusalem in the latter part of May, and that there and then he commissioned Apollonius to rifle and profane the temple. The exact time from the period when this was done, down to the time of the expurgation, seems to have been, and is designated as being, 1290 days." - Hints on Prophecy, pp. 94, 95. It is evident, however, that there is here no clear making out of the exact time by any historical records, though it is in itself not improbable. Still the great difficulty is, that in the supposition that the "time, and times, and an half" refers to Antiochus, as denoting the period of his persecutions, thus limiting it to three years and a half - a period which can be made out without material difficulty (compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-28</a>) - that another time or period should be mentioned here of thirty days more, concerning which there is no corresponding event in the historical facts, or at least none that can now be demonstrated to have occurred. See the remarks at the close of the next verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. from &#8230; sacrifice &#8230; taken way &#8230; abomination&#8212;(Da 11:31). As to this epoch, which probably is prophetically germinant and manifold; the profanation of the temple by Antiochus (in the month Ijar of the year 145 B.C., till the restoration of the worship by Judas Maccabeus on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month [Chisleu] of 148 B.C., according to the Seleucid era, 1290 days; forty-five days more elapsed before Antiochus' death in the month Shebat of 148 B.C., so ending the Jews' calamities [Maurer]); by pagan Rome, after Christ's death; by Mohammed; by Antichrist, the culmination of apostate Rome. The "abomination" must reach its climax (see Auberlen's translation, "summit," Da 9:27), and the measure of iniquity be full, before Messiah comes.<p>thousand two hundred and ninety days&#8212;a month beyond the "time, times, and a half" (Da 12:7). In Da 12:12, forty-five days more are added, in all 1335 days. Tregelles thinks Jesus at His coming will deliver the Jews. An interval elapses, during which their consciences are awakened to repentance and faith in Him. A second interval elapses in which Israel's outcasts are gathered, and then the united blessing takes place. These stages are marked by the 1260, 1290, and 1335 days. Cumming thinks the 1260 years begin when Justinian in A. D. 533 subjected the Eastern churches to John II, bishop of Rome; ending in 1792, when the Code Napoleon was established and the Pope was dishonored. 1290 reach to 1822, about the time of the waning of the Turkish power, the successor to Greece in the empire of the East. Forty-five years more end in 1867, the end of "the times of the Gentiles." See Le 26:24, "seven times," that is, 7 X 360, or 2520 years: 652 B.C. is the date of Judah's captivity, beginning under Manasseh; 2520 from this date end in 1868, thus nearly harmonizing with the previous date, 1867. See on [1114]Da 8:14. The seventh millenary of the world [Clinton] begins in 1862. Seven years to 1869 (the date of the second advent) constitute the reign of the personal Antichrist; in the last three and a half, the period of final tribulation, Enoch (or else Moses) and Elijah, the two witnesses, prophesy in sackcloth. This theory is very dubious (compare Mt 24:36; Ac 1:7; 1Th 5:2; 2Pe 3:10); still the event alone can tell whether the chronological coincidences of such theories are fortuitous, or solid data on which to fix the future times.

The Septuagint is, "From <span class="cmt_word">the</span> time the sacrifice is taken away for ever, and the abomination of desolation is prepared to be set up, are a thousand two hundred and ninety days." The translator must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> ('<span class="accented">olath</span>) before him, and read it <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> ('<span class="accented">olah</span>), else he could not have translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;</span> "for ever," and written "sacrifice" also. The Hebrew copyist, following the usage of Palestine, which makes "sacrifice" understood after "continual," had omitted it in the text followed by the Massoretes. Theodotion's rendering is, "From the time of the change of the daily sacrifice (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) and the abomination of desolation set up ("given," <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is a thousand two hundred and ninety days." The Peshitta and Vulgate do not call for remarks. This verse is a veritable cruz <span class="accented">interpretum. From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away.</span> This event is referred to in <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>. Whether the eleventh chapter is earlier or later is in our opinion scarcely doubtful. Also in <a href="/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a> we have the taking away of the daily sacrifice mentioned as one of the deeds of Antiochus. While the reference in ch. 11. and ch. 8. is to the action of Antiochus, it is not necessary to maintain that this refers to him; other oppressors might take away the daily sacrifice. This clause certainly seems to give the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span>, but it is difficult to fix the date in question. Certainly from the fact that the words used here are used by the writer of the eleventh chapter to describe the actions of Antiochus, and that in 1 Macc. 1:54 there is also a similar identification, we might be inclined to take the event here mentioned as the starting-point of the twelve hundred and ninety days. But the acknowledged impossibility of fitting the days to the chronology militates against this view. <span class="accented">And the abomination that maketh desolate set up.</span> At first sight the reader is inclined to follow Wieseler, and regard this as a statement of the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem.</span> The grammatical difficulties against this  view are forcible. Although <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>... <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, "from" and "to," are sometimes used for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> ... <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, "from... until," it is rare, and the intrusion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;</span>, "and," is strong against this interpretation. Yet it seems strange that two <span class="accented">termini a quo</span> should be assigned and no ter<span class="accented">minus ad quota. A thousand two hundred and ninety days.</span> While this seems to be the same period as that reckoned in the seventh verse, "a time, times, and half a time," yet it is not absolutely coincident. It is thirty days more than three and a half times the prophetic year of three hundred and sixty, and eleven days more than three and a half mean solar years. As we have already said, if we take the profanation of the temple, 25th Casleu, 145 Seleucid era, as our starting-point, it is impossible to fix any great deliverance or any event of importance which happened some three years and seven months after. Antiochus may have died seven months after the news arrived of the reconsecration of the temple; but we have no data. As above stated, the death of Antiochus wrought but little alteration in the condition of the Jews. If we regard the days as literal days, there is one period that nearly coincides with the twelve hundred and ninety days - our Lord's ministry upon the earth. It is difficult to understand how our Lord's commencing his ministry was the removing of the daily sacrifice. Yet in the "heavenlies" it might be so. Further, we sometimes reckon "from" a period to come, as we can say, "We are yet  -  weeks from harvest, midsummer, or Christmas." So the Crucifixion as the fulfilment of all the sacrifices of the Law may be regarded as their removal. Certainly in his crucifixion was the real abomination which maketh desolate set up. It suits the next verse. From our Lord's crucifixion to his ascension there would be exactly forty-five days if, as is commonly believed, his ascension, as his resurrection, took place on a Sunday. This, however, is merely a thought thrown out. If we take the date indicated by our Lord, the war against the Jews, dating from Vespasian's march to Ptolemais in the beginning of A.D.  to the capture of the temple and the cessation of the daily sacrifice (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:02. 1), is not far off twelve hundred and ninety days. From this to the final capture of the city is close upon forty-five days. If we, however, take a day for a year, then another series of possible solutions are before us, all more or less faulty. One has the merit of postponing the solution to a date still future. The capture of Jerusalem by the Arabs in A.D.  is made the starting-point; if we add to that twelve hundred and ninety years, we have A.D. . The Mohammedan power may have fallen by that time; anything may have happened then. All these various solutions, all more or less unsatisfactory, prove that no solution is possible. If the fulfilment is yet in the future, circumstances may convey to us the interpretation. We must remember the vision was sealed to "the time of the end." Professor Fuller suggests that Babylonian discovery may at some future date throw light on Daniel's use of numbers. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The construction of this verse is disputed. The second &#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; (I was seeing) repeats the first for the purpose of carrying on the line of thought broken by the interposed sentence. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; (then) is separated by the accents from the first &#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; and joined to the clause following: "then on account of the voice of the great words." By this interposed sentence the occasion of the judgment which Daniel sees passed upon the beast is once more brought to view. &#1511;&#1500; &#1502;&#1503;, "on account of the voice of the words," i.e., on account of the loud words, not "from the time of the words, or from the time when the voice of the great words made itself heard" (Klief.). The following expression, &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491; (till that), does not by any means require the temporal conception &#1502;&#1503;. To specify the terminus a quo of the vision was as little necessary here as in the &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; &#1495;&#1494;&#1492;, <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>. The temporal conception of &#1502;&#1503; alters not only the parallelism of the passage <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-11.htm">Daniel 7:11</a>, but also the course of thought in the representation, according to which Daniel remains overwhelmed during the vision till all the separate parts of it have passed before his view, i.e., till he has seen the close of the judgment. The first part of this scene consists of the constituting of the judgment (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>), the second of the death and extinction of the horn speaking great things (<a href="/daniel/7-11.htm">Daniel 7:11</a>), with which is connected (<a href="/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>) the mention of the destruction of the dominion of the other beasts. If one considers that the words "I beheld till that" correspond with the like expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, he will not seek, with Kran., in the &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491; a reference to a lasting process of judicial execution ending with destruction. The thought is simply this: Daniel remained contemplating the vision till the beast was slain, etc. &#1495;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1488; (the beast) is, by virtue of the explanatory sentence interposed in the first hemistich, the horn speaking great things. The ungodly power of the fourth beast reaches its climax in the blaspheming horn; in this horn, therefore, the beast is slain and destroyed, while its body is given to the burning. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1514; (to the burning fire) corresponds with the Hebr. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1508;&#1514;, <a href="/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10</a>. The burning in the fire is not the mere figure of destruction, specially justified by the thunder-storm which gathered as a veil around the scene of judgment (Kran.), for there is no mention of a storm either in <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a> or anywhere else in this entire vision. The supposition that the burning is only the figure of destruction, as e.g., in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>, is decidedly opposed by the parallel passages, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-14.htm">Isaiah 66:14</a>, which Daniel had in view, and <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where this prophecy is again taken up, and the judgment is expressed by a being cast into a like of fire with everlasting torment; so that v. Lengerke is right when he remarks that this passage speaks of the fiery torments of the wicked after death, and thus that a state of retribution after death is indicated. </body></html>
