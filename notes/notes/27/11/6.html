From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in the end of years - In the future periods of the history of these two kingdoms. The event here referred to did not occur during the lives of these two kings, Seleucus Nicator and Ptolemy Soter, but in the reign of their successors, Ptolemy Philadelphus and Antiochus Theos or Theus. The phrase "the end of years" would well denote such a future period. The Vulgate renders it, "after the end of years;" that is, after many years have elapsed. The meaning is "after a certain course or lapse of years." The word "end" in Daniel (&#1511;&#1509;  qe&#770;ts) often seems to refer to a time when a predicted event would be fulfilled, whether near or remote; whether it would be really the "end" or "termination" of an empire or of the world, or whether it would be succeeded by other events. It would be the end of that matter - of the thing predicted; and in this sense the word seems to be employed here. Compare <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a> (margin), and <a href="/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13</a>. "They shall join themselves together." Margin, "associate." The meaning is, that there would be an alliance formed, or an attempt made, to unite the two kingdoms more closely by a marriage between different persons of the royal families. The word "they" refers to the two sovereigns of Egypt and Syria - the south and the north.<p>For the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement - Margin, "rights." The Hebrew word properly means rectitudes or rights (in the plural &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  me&#772;ysha&#770;r&#305;&#770;ym); but here it seems to be used in the sense of "peace," or an alliance. The act of making peace was regarded as an act of "justice," or doing "right," and hence, the word came to be used in the sense of making an alliance or compact. This idea we should now express by saying that the design was "to make things right or straight" - as if they were wrong and crooked before, giving occasion to discord, and misunderstanding, and wars. The intention, now was to establish peace on a permanent basis. The compact here referred to was one formed between Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and Antiochus Theos, king of Syria. Ptolemy, in order to bring a war in which he was engaged to an end, and to restore peace, gave his daughter in marriage to Antiochus, in hopes of establishing a permanent peace and alliance between the two kingdoms. One of the conditions of this alliance was, that Antiochus should divorce his former wife Laodice, and that the children of that former wife should be excluded from the succession to the throne. In this way Ptolemy hoped that the kingdom of Syria might become ultimately attached to that of Egypt, if there should be children by the marriage of Berenice with Antiochus. Ptolemy, however, died two years after this marriage was consummated, and Antiochus restored again his former wife Laodice, and put away Berenice, but was himself murdered by Laodice, who feared the fickleness of her husband. The officers of the court of Syria then planned the death of Berenice and her children, but she fled with them to Daphne, and was there put to death, with her children. - Appian, c. lxv.; Lengerke, in loc. She was put to death by poison. See Gill, in loc.<p>But she shall not retain the power of the arm - The word "retain" here is the same as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8</a>, "I retained no strength." The word "arm" is a word of frequent use in the Old Testament, both in the singular and plural, to denote "strength, power," whether of an individual or an army. So <a href="//biblehub.com/job/22-8.htm">Job 22:8</a>, "A man of arm," that is, "strength;" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>, "The arms (power) of his hands were made strong by the God of Jacob." Compare <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>. It is frequently used in this chapter in the sense of "strength," or "power." See <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-15.htm">Daniel 11:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a>, <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>. This alliance was formed with the hope that the succession might be in her. She was, however, as stated above, with her children, put to death. While queen of Syria, she, of course, had power, and had the prospect of succeeding to the supreme authority.<p>Neither shall he stand - The king of the south; to wit, Egypt. That is, he would not prosper in his ambitious purpose of bringing Syria, by this marriage alliance, under his control.<p>Nor his arm - What he regarded as his strength, and in which he placed reliance, as one does on his arm in accomplishing any design. The word "arm" here is used in the sense of "help," or "alliance;" that is, that on which he depended for the stability of his empire.<p>But she shall be given up - That is, she shall be given up to death, to wit, by the command of Laodice.<p>And they that brought her - That is, those who conducted her to Daphne; or these who came with her into Syria, and who were her attendants and friends. Of course they would be surrendered or delivered up when she was put to death.<p>And he that begat her - Margin, "or, whom she brought forth." The margin expresses the sense more correctly. The Latin Vulgate is, "adolescentes ejus." The Greek, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  he&#772; neanis. So the Syriac. The Hebrew (&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1512;&#1492;  vehayoleda&#770;h) will admit of this construction. The article in the word has the force of a relative, and is connected with the suffix, giving it a relative signification. See Ewald, as quoted by Lengerke, in loc. According to the present pointing, indeed, the literal meaning would be, "and he who begat her;" but this pointing is not authoritative. Dathe, Bertholdt, Dereser, DeWette, and Rosenmuller suppose that the reading should be &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1492;  vehayaleda&#770;h. Then the sense would be, "her child," or "her offspring." Lengerke and Ewald, however, suppose that this idea is implied in the present reading of the text, and that no change is necessary. The obvious meaning is, that she and her child, or her offspring, would be thus surrendered. The matter of fact was, that her little son was slain with her. See Prideaux's "Connexions," iii.120.<p>And he that stregnthened her in these times - It is not known who is here referred to. Doubtless, on such an occasion, she would have some one who would be a confidential counselor or adviser, and, whoever that was, he would be likely to be cut off with her. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. in &#8230; end of years&#8212;when the predicted time shall be consummated (Da 11:13, Margin; Da 8:17; 12:13).<p>king's daughter of the south&#8212;Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt. The latter, in order to end his war with Antiochus Theus, "king of the north" (literally, "midnight": the prophetical phrase for the region whence came affliction to Israel, Jer 1:13-15; Joe 2:20), that is, Syria, gave Berenice to Antiochus, who thereupon divorced his former wife, Laodice, and disinherited her son, Seleucus Callinicus. The designation, "king of the north" and "of the south," is given in relation to Judea, as the standpoint. Egypt is mentioned by name (Da 11:8, 42), though Syria is not; because the former was in Daniel's time a flourishing kingdom, whereas Syria was then a mere dependency of Assyria and Babylon: an undesigned proof of the genuineness of the Book of Daniel.<p>agreement&#8212;literally, "rights," that is, to put things to rights between the belligerents.<p>she shall not retain the power of the arm&#8212;She shall not be able to effect the purpose of the alliance, namely, that she should be the mainstay of peace.

The king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement; Bernice shall come from Egypt and marry with Antiochus Theus, who was the son of Antiochus Soter, and nephew to Seleucus Nicanor, for her father brought her to Pelusium with an infinite sum of gold and silver for her dowry. Here was nothing sincere on either side, for each gaped after the other’s kingdom, and covered all with a league and a marriage; for Antiochus put away his lawful wife Laodice, by whom he had two children, that he might take her sister to wife. Thus sacred wedlock and leagues were violated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But she shall not retain the power of the arm; </span> she continued not in favour and authority, for Antiochus now put away Bernice, and took Laodice again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither shall he stand, nor his arm; </span> for she made away Antiochus by poison, and set up her son Seleucus Callinicus in his stead, who slew Bernice.

The two kings of Egypt and Syria; not the two former kings, but their successors: the king of Egypt was Ptolemy Philadelphus, the second king of Egypt, the son of Ptolemy Lagus; this is the king of Egypt who collected such a vast number of books into his library at Alexandria, and got the law of Moses translated into Greek: the king of Syria was Antiochus, surnamed Theos; this name was first given him by the Milesians, upon his delivering them from the tyranny of Timarchus governor of Caria; he was the third king of Syria; Seleucus Nicator the first, Antiochus Soter the second, and this the third: there had been very great wars between these kings for many years; and now, being weary of them, they entered into confederacies and alliances with each other, and which were designed to be strengthened by a marriage next mentioned; this is thought to be about seventy years after the death of Alexander: (q). <p>for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement; this was Bernice, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus king of Egypt, who carried her to Pelusium, and from thence sailed with her to Seleucia in Syria; where he met with Antiochus king of Syria, to whom he gave her in marriage, with a vast dowry of gold and silver; hence she was called  and the marriage was celebrated with great solemnity (r): and this was "to make agreement", or "to make things right or straight" (s); that were wrong and crooked before; to put an end to wars and discords; to make peace and cultivate friendship; to strengthen alliances, and confirm each other in their kingdoms: <p>but she shall not retain the power of the arm; unite the two kingdoms, and secure the peace of them, which was the thing in view; nor retain her interest in her husband, nor her power at court; for, as soon as her father was dead, Antiochus dismissed Bernice from his bed, and took Laodice his former wife again, by whom he had had two sons, Seleucus Callinicus, and Antiochus Hierax (t): <p>neither shall he stand, nor his arm; neither Antiochus; for Laodice, knowing that by the late treaty the crown was settled upon the children of Bernice, who already had a son by him, and sensible of his fickleness, and fearing he might divorce her again, and take to Bernice, got him poisoned by his servants: nor Bernice his queen, called "his arm"; who fleeing to Daphne for shelter, on hearing what was done, was there slain; or it may be his son he had by her, so it follows: <p>but she shall be given up; into the hands of Seleucus Callinicus, the son of Laodice; whom she placed on the throne after the death of his father; and who sent to Daphne to slay Bernice, which was accordingly done (u): <p>and they that brought her; into Syria; that attended her from Egypt at her marriage, and continued with her in the court of Syria, and fled with her to Daphne: <p>and he that begat her: or, "whom she brought forth"; as in the margin; her little son, who was murdered at the same time with her; for her father died before: <p>and he that strengthened her in these times; either her husband, or her father, who were both dead before, and so stood not, and could not help her; unless this is to be understood of her brother, and the cities of the lesser Asia, who, hearing of her distress at Daphne, set out for her relief, but came too late; she and her son were both slain first (w). <p>(q) See the Universal History, vol. 9. p. 384.

In order to terminate his long wars with Antiochus II. (Theos), Ptolemy Philadelphus gave him in marriage his daughter, Berenice, upon condition that he should divorce his legitimate wife, Laodice, and that his two sons, Seleucus and Antiochus, should renounce all claim to the throne of Syria: in the event of Antiochus and Berenice having issue, Ptolemy hoped in this way to secure Syria as an Egyptian province. After two years, however, Ptolemy died. Antiochus then took back Laodice, and divorced Berenice. Laodice, however, dreading her husband’s fickleness (‘ambiguum viri animum,’ Jerome), and fearing lest he might again evince a preference for Berenice, before long procured his death by poison. She then persuaded her son, Seleucus, to secure the throne for himself by murdering both Berenice and her infant child (Jerome <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>; Appian, <span class="ital">Syr.</span> 65; Justin xxvii. 1).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">at the end of</span> (some) <span class="ital">years</span>] 31 years after the death of Seleucus Nicator.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">join themselves together</span>] by the matrimonial alliance just described.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and</span> <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="bld">daughter of the king</span> <span class="ital">of the south</span>] Berenice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">come to</span>] in marriage (cf. <a href="/joshua/15-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, as she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What would you?">Joshua 15:18</a>; <a href="/judges/12-9.htm" title="And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.

The expression is a vague one. The reference may be (Ewald, Meinh.) to Berenice’s attendants, who accompanied her to Antioch, and met there the same fate as their mistress; it may be (Hitz., Keil) simply to Antiochus (the plural being generic, without reference to the number of persons actually meant; cf. <a href="/genesis/21-7.htm" title="And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.">Genesis 21:7</a>, <a href="/matthew/2-20.htm" title="Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.">Matthew 2:20</a>); it may even be, more generally, to the ministers of Ptolemy who supported the alliance, and who were ‘given up,’ in the sense of finding their expectations disappointed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he that begat her</span> <span class="bld">and supported</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/11-1.htm" title="Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.">Daniel 11:1</a></span>) <span class="ital">her</span>] Ptolemy Philadelphus (so Ew., Hitz., Keil).

It is certainly difficult to see the reading from which this rendering came. It is noticeable that there is no reference to "the king's daughter of the south." History confirms the statement in the Massoretic text, but there is no expedition related in the history of Philadelphus undertaken against the kingdom of Syria. It is trite our records of the reign of Philadelphus are somewhat scanty. Theodotion is nearer the Massoretic text, though not quite in accordance with it, "And after his Jays they shall mingle with one another (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); and the daughter of the king of the south shall enter unto the king of the north to make treaties with him: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; and his seed shall not stand: and she shall be betrayed, and those that brought her, both the damsel and he that did violence to her." The last words are separated from this verse and conjoined to the following verse. The text behind this seems, in many ways, superior to the Massoretic. The Peshitta agrees in the opening clauses with the Massoretic; at the end of the verse the difference is considerable, "But power shall not be in her, from the fear which she feared: and she shall be betrayed, and her youths, and those accompanying her, and those supporting her in this time." The Vulgate agrees pretty closely with this. The reference here is generally understood to be to the affinity made by the Lagids with the Seleucids, when Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphns, married Antiochus II. (Theos), who repudiated his first wife, Laodike, in order to do so. The leap over a space of approximately sixty years is not so trying as Professor Fuller imagines; but the uncertainty as to the text is great, and the meaning of even the Massoretic is by no means fixed. Still, the agreement with the course of events is so marked according to the common interpretation, that one feels inclined to adopt it. After the death of her father Philadelphus, Antiochus Theos took back Laodike, who, in order to escape the risk of being again dismissed, unceremoniously poisoned her rival Berenice and her <span class="accented">son</span>, and then her husband Antiochus. Yet this transaction seems somewhat dubiously set forth in the Massoretic text. Theodotion is closer to facts, though it is possible that the text has been altered to suit what were known to be facts. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The address, Thou, O king, is here an absolute clause, and is not resumed till <a href="/daniel/5-22.htm">Daniel 5:22</a>.

The brilliant description of Nebuchadnezzar's power in <a href="/daniel/5-18.htm">Daniel 5:18</a> and <a href="/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a> has undeniably the object of impressing it on the mind of Belshazzar that he did not equal his father in power and majesty.
