But besides the enemy, the “prince of the covenant” is to be destroyed also. This expression is most readily explained by observing that it stands in contrast with the hostile armies mentioned in the first clause. It is an expression similar to “men of covenant,” “lords of covenant,” and means “those who were at peace with him,” “prince” being used as a collective noun (see <a href="/daniel/11-18.htm" title="After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn on him.">Daniel 11:18</a>).

Thus Theodoret: “He speaks of the pious high-priest, Onias, the brother of Jason, and foretels that even he should be turned out of his office.” As soon as Antiochus was seated in his throne, he removed Onias from the high-priesthood, and preferred Jason, Onias’s brother, to that dignity, not for any crime committed against him by the former, but for the great sums of money which were offered to him by the latter. For Jason offered to give no less than three hundred and sixty talents of silver for the high- priesthood, besides eighty more upon another account: and good Onias was not only displaced to make way for a wicked usurper, but after a few years, living at Antioch, he was, with as great treachery as cruelty, murdered by the king’s deputy. But though Antiochus had <span class="ital">made a league </span>with Jason the new high-priest, yet he did not faithfully adhere to it, but acted <span class="ital">deceitfully; </span>and substituted his brother Menelaus in his room, by means of an armed force, because he offered him three hundred talents more than that which he had received from Jason. <span class="ital">For — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">And he shall come up, </span>(for the words do not assign a reason for any thing that precedes,) <span class="ital">and shall become strong with a small people — </span>Antiochus had been many years a hostage at Rome; and, coming from thence with only a few attendants, he appeared in Syria little at first, but soon received a great increase. <span class="ital">He shall enter peaceably into the fattest places of the province — </span>By the friendship of Eumenes and Attalus he <span class="ital">entered peaceably </span>upon the upper provinces, and likewise upon the provinces of Cœlosyria and Palestine. And wherever he came he outdid <span class="ital">his fathers, and his fathers’ fathers, </span>in liberality and profusion. <span class="ital">He scattered among them the prey, and spoil, and riches — </span>The <span class="ital">prey </span>of his enemies, the <span class="ital">spoil </span>of temples, and the <span class="ital">riches </span>of his friends, as well as his own revenues, were expended in public shows, and bestowed in largesses among the people. In the first book of Maccabees, chap. <a href="/daniel/3-30.htm" title="Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.">Daniel 3:30</a>, it is affirmed, that in <span class="ital">the liberal giving of gifts he abounded above the kings that were before him. </span>Polybius relates, that sometimes, meeting accidentally with people whom he had never seen before, he would enrich them with unexpected presents; and sometimes, standing in the public streets, he would throw about his money, and cry aloud, “Let him take it to whom fortune shall give it.” His generosity was the more requisite, to fix the provinces of Cœlosyria and Palestine in his interest, because they were claimed as of right belonging to the king of Egypt. Antiochus rejected this claim, and foreseeing that these demands would prove the occasion of a new war between the two crowns, came to Joppa to take a view of the frontiers, and to put them into a proper posture of defence. In his progress he came to Jerusalem, and, as it was evening, he was ushered into the city by torch-light with great rejoicing. From thence he went to Phenicia to fortify his own <span class="ital">strong holds, </span>and to <span class="ital">forecast his devices against those of the enemy; </span>the LXX. and Arabic read, <span class="ital">against Egypt. </span>Thus he acted <span class="ital">even for a time, </span>and employed some years in his hostile preparations.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-30 The angel shows Daniel the succession of the Persian and Grecian empires. The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between their dominions, and affected by their contests. From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And with the arms of a flood - The refercnce here is to some mighty invasion of some country by Antiochus, which would sweep everything before him. There seems to be some confusion of metaphor in the phrase, "the arms of a flood." The idea in the mind of the writer appears to have been this: He saw an invasion of some country by hosts of men under the command of Antiochus. This it was not unnatural to compare with an "inundation of waters" spreading over a land. See <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>. Nor was it altogether unnatural to speak of an inundation as having "arms" extending far and near; sweeping everything to itself, or carrying it away. Thus we speak of an arm of the sea, an arm of a river, etc. In this manner the inundation - the invasion - seemed to spread itself out like waters, sweeping all away.<p>Shall they be overflown, from before him - The prophet does not specify "who" they would be that would thus be overthrown. Some have supposed that the reference is to the Hebrews, but the more correct interpretation is what refers it to Egypt, See the notes at <a href="/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a>. As a matter of fact, the forces of Heliodorus, the forces of the Hebrews, and the forces of the Egyptians, were alike broken and scattered before him. The eye of the prophet, however, seems rather here to be on the invasion of Egypt, which was one of the earliest and most prominent acts of Antiochus, and into the history of which the prophet goes most into detail.<p>Yea, also the prince of the covenant - He also shall be broken and overcome. There has been some diversity of opinion as to who is meant by "the prince of the covenant" here. Many suppose that it is the high priest of the Jews, as being the chief prince or ruler under the "covenant" which God made with them, or among the "covenant" people. But this appellation is not elsewhere given to the Jewish high priest, nor is it such as could with much propriety be applied to him. The reference is rather to the king of Egypt, with whom a covenant or compact had been made by Antiochus the Great, and who was supposed to be united, therefore, to the Syrians by a solemn treaty.

(2 Maccabees 4) <p>Others think Seleucus Philopator his brother is meant, which is not probable, his death being before described; rather Demetrius his nephew, with whom he covenanted to hold the kingdom for him, or through whom the covenant and peace with the Romans was continued so long, he being an hostage at Rome; though others are of opinion that Trypho, a peer of the realm of Egypt, is designed, who was the principal person concerned in a covenant made between Antiochus and Ptolemy Philometor king of Egypt; though it is more likely that Ptolemy himself is the person intended. <p>(r)   "et brachia inundationis inundabantur", Cocceius, Michaelis "brachia inundantia", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And with the <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> covenant.</span><p>(t) He shows that great foreign powers will come to help the young son of Seleucus against his uncle Antiochus, and yet will be overthrown.<p>(u) Meaning Ptolemais Philopater's son, who was this child's cousin, and is here called the prince of the covenant, because he was the chief, and all others followed his conduct.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">And</span> <span class="bld">the arms</span> <span class="ital">of</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">flood</span>] fig. for opposing forces.

General description of Antiochus’ character and dealings. The verses have often (from Jerome onwards) been referred to Antiochus’ first Egyptian campaign; but though occurrences in that campaign may be alluded to in them, they cannot, as a whole, be understood naturally as a description of it[378].

The rendering of the LXX. is very wide of this, "And the broken arms he shall break from before him." Although this is much shorter than the Massoretic text, yet the contradictory assertion that arms already broken are broken before him is conclusive against accepting the evidence of the Septuagint absolutely. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic, not with the English versinns, "And the arms of the overflowing shall be overflowed from before him, and be broken, even the leader of the covenant." The Peshitta is widely different, alike from the Massoretic text and that of the Septuagint, ";And their mighty ones of the city he shall carry away, and they shall be broken from before him, even the leader of the covenant." The Vulgate stands in a closer relation with the above than with the Massoretic text or the Greek versions, "The arms (<span class="accented">brachia</span>) of one fighting shall be driven out (<span class="accented">expugnabuntur</span>) from his face, and shall be broken besides, and (<span class="accented">insuper et</span>) the leader of the covenant."

The idea supported by Hitzig, Bevan, Behrmann, that Onias III. is referred to, is founded on the utterly unhistorical narrative in 2 Macc. 4. The view of Moses Stuart is that it is some sovereign who had a league of amity with Epiphanes. The reference thus might be to Eumenes or Attalus, who supported the claims of Anthochs. <span class="accented">Negeed bereeth</span> may be explanatory of the prenominal  suffix in <span class="accented">milpanayo</span>, "before <span class="accented">him."</span> As Stuart acutely remarks, had the reference in be<span class="accented">reeth</span> been to the Divine covenant with the Jews, we should have had <span class="accented">habbeereth.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this situation Daniel excelled all the presidents and satraps. &#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1495;, to show one's self prominent.

But since they could find no occasion against Daniel in this respect, for he was &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;, faithful, to be relied on, and no fault could be charged against him, they sought occasion against him on the side of his particular religion, in the matter of the law of his God, i.e., in his worship of God.</body></html>
