The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they that under stand among the people - Among the Hebrew people. The allusion is to such as, in those times of so general corruption and apostasy, should have a proper understanding of the law of God and the nature of religion. There were such in the days of Judas Maccabeus, and it is reasonable to suppose that they would endeavor to inculcate just views among the people.<p>Shall instruct many - In the nature of religion; in their duty to their country and to God. See Prideaux, "Con." iii.265.<p>Yet they shall fall by the sword - They shall not be immediately nor always successful. Their final triumph would be only after many of them had fallen in battle, or been made captives. Matrathins, the father of Judas Maccabeus, who began the opposition to Antiochus (1 Macc. 2:1), having summoned to his standard as many as he could induce to follow him, retired for security to the mountains. He was pursued, and refusing to fight on the Sabbath, his enemies came upon him, and killed many of his followers, 1 Macc. 2:14-37. The author of the book of Maccabees (1 Macc. 2:38) says of this: "So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, and they slew them, with their wives and children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand people."<p>And by flame - By fire. That is, probably, their dwellings would be fired, and they would perish in the flames, or in caves where they fled for shelter, or by being cast into heated caldrons of brass. See 2 Macc. 6:11: "And others that had run together into caves near by" (when Antiochus endeavored to enforce on them the observance of pagan laws and customs), "to keep the sabbath-day secretly, being discovered to Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a conscience to help themselves for the honor of the most sacred day." 2 Macc. 7:3-5: "Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made hot: which immediately being heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his body, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on. Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commanded him, being yet alive, to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan," etc.<p>By captivity - 1 Macc. 1:32: "But the women and children took they captive." See also 2 Macc. 5:24.<p>And by spoil - By plunder, to wit, of the temple and city. See 1 Macc. 1:20-24.<p>Many days - Hebrew, "days." The time is not specified, but the idea is that it would be for a considerable period. Josephus says it was three years. - "Ant." b. xii. ch. vii.

They shall be sorely persecuted, even to death (Heb 11:35, 36, 37; 2 Maccabees 6, 7). Their enemies took advantage of the Sabbath to slay them on the day when they would not fight. Tregelles thinks, from comparison with Da 11:35, it is the people who "fall," not those of understanding. But Da 11:35 makes the latter "fall," not an unmeaning repetition; in Da 11:33 they fall (die) by persecution; in Da 11:35 they fall (spiritually) for a time by their own weakness.<p>flame&#8212;in caves, whither they had retired to keep the Sabbath.

The Vulgate does not supply any point worthy of remark. <span class="accented">And they that understand among</span> <span class="accented">the people shall instruct many.</span> In 1 Macc. 2:27 we have an account of a multitude instructed in the Law and determined to keep it, who, with their wives, children, and cattle, retired into the desert. <span class="accented">Yet they shall fall by the sword</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> After the multitude pursued the army of King Antiochus, which was at Jerusalem, and overtook them, the fugitives would not submit to sacrifice to idols. The army assailed them on the sabbath day; from a superstitious reverence for the clay of rest, they did not even defend themselves, and therefore fell an easy prey to their enemies (1 Macc. 2:38, "They slew them with their wives, and children, and their cattle to the number of a thousand people"). While we would not be held as regarding as literally historical the sufferings of Eleazar and the seven brethren and their mother, as related in 2 Marc. 6. and 7, and more fully in 4 Maccabees, yet it can only have been an exaggeration of what must have actually occurred.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the king, who knew and highly valued (cf. v. 2[[1]) Daniel's fidelity to the duties of his office, was so sore displeased by the accusation, that he laboured till the going down of the sun to effect his deliverance. The verb &#1489;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; has an intransitive meaning: to be evil, to be displeased, and is not joined into one sentence with the subject &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488;, which stands here absolute; and the subject to &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497; &#1489;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is undefined: it, namely, the matter displeased him; cf. <a href="/genesis/21-11.htm">Genesis 21:11</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1501; corresponds to the Hebr. &#1500;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17</a>, to lay to heart. The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, cor, mens, is unknown in the later Chaldee, but is preserved in the Syr. ba&#772;la&#772;&#768; and the Arab. ba&#770;lun.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16-17</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-15.htm">Daniel 6:15-16</a>)<p>When the king could not till the going down of the sun resolve on passing sentence against Daniel, about this time his accusers gathered themselves together into his presence for the purpose of inducing him to carry out the threatened punishment, reminding him that, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, every prohibition and every command which the king decreed (&#1497;&#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;), i.e., issued in a legal form, could not be changed, i.e., could not be recalled. There being no way of escape out of the difficulty for the king, he had to give the command that the punishment should be inflicted, and Daniel was cast into the den of lions, v. 17 (<a href="/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16</a>). On the Aphel &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, and the pass. from (<a href="/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a>) &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514;, see at <a href="/daniel/3-13.htm">Daniel 3:13</a>. The execution of the sentence was carried out, according to Oriental custom, on the evening of the day in which the accusation was made; this does not, however, imply that it was on the evening in which, at the ninth hour, he had prayed, as Hitzig affirms, in order that he may thereby make the whole matter improbable. In giving up Daniel to punishment, the king gave expression to the wish, "May thy God whom thou servest continually, deliver thee!" not "He will deliver thee;" for Darius could not have this confidence, but he may have had the feeble hope of the possibility of the deliverance which from his heart he wished, inasmuch as he may have heard of the miracles of the Almighty God whom Daniel served in the days of Belshazzar and Nebuchadnezzar.</body></html>
