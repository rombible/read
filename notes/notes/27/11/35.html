The persecutions which were to befall the church under antichrist were and are designed for the same purpose, as appears by comparing <a href="/daniel/12-10.htm" title="Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.">Daniel 12:10</a> with the words here; Antiochus’s persecution being a type and figure of that under antichrist. <span class="ital">Even to the time of the end — </span>Namely, the time appointed by God for the ending of these calamities. <span class="ital">Because it is yet for a time appointed — </span>It will be still some time before a deliverance will be granted: or, these calamities are appointed to last for some time.

From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And some of them understanding shall fall - Some of those who have a correct understanding of religion, and who have joined the army from pure motives. The idea seems to be that on some occasion they would meet with a temporary defeat, in order that the sincerity of the others might be tested, or that it might be seen who adhered to the cause from principle, and who from selfish purposes. If they should not always be successful; if they should be temporarily defeated; if some of the most eminent among them should fall among the slain; and if the cause should at any time look dark, this would serve to try the sin cerity of the remainder of the army, and would be likely to "thin it off" of those who had joined it only from mercenary motives.<p>To try them - Margin, "or, by them." So the Hebrew - &#1489;&#1492;&#1501;  ba&#770;hem. The meaning perhaps is, that it would be "by" them, as it were, that the army would be tried. As they would fall in battle, and as the cause would seem to be doubtful, this would test the fidelity of others. The word "try" here (&#1510;&#1512;&#1507;  tsa&#770;raph) means, properly, "to melt, to smelt" - as metals; then to prove anyone; and then to purify.<p>And to purge - To purify; to test the army and to make it pure.<p>And to make them white - To wit, by thus allowing those who had joined the army from mercenary motives to withdraw. Compare 2 Macc. 12:39-41.<p>Even to the time of the end - The end of the war or the conflict. There would be an end of these persecutions and trials, and this process had reference to that, or tended to bring it about. The act of freeing the army from false friends - from those who had joined it from mercenary motives, would have a tendency to accomplish the result in the best way possible, and in the speediest manner.<p>Because it is yet for a time appointed - See the notes at <a href="/daniel/11-27.htm">Daniel 11:27</a>. This seems to be designed for an assurance that the calamity would come to an end, or that there was a limit beyond which it could not pass. Thus it would be an encouragement to those who were engaged in the struggle, for they would see that success must ultimately crown their labors. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. to try them&#8212;the design of affliction.

Afflictions are the furnace in which the Lord refines and purifies his people; the fan with which he purges his floor; and the fuller's soap with which he makes his people white; by all this the iniquity of Jacob is purged, and the fruit of it is to take away sin, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>, so that afflictions are not hurtful, but beneficial to the saints, even those more violent ones, severe persecutions. <p>Even to the time of the end; because it is yet for a time appointed; these distresses, calamities, and persecutions, would have an end, and the time for it was appointed of God; as yet it was not come, but quickly would, and then an end would be put to the third or Grecian monarchy; a hint of the Roman power over that being given, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>, hence we have no further account of Antiochus or his sons.

The rendering of the LXX. is, "And some of those of understanding shall consider to purify themselves beth to be chosen and to be purified to the time of the end, for the season is for hours." The translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. The reading of the Massoretes is to be preferred. Theodotion's, while closer to the Massoretic text,' is not identical with the sense as represented by the Authorized and Revised Versions, "And some of those of understanding shall be weak to try them, that they may be chosen out and revealed at the end of time, for it yet is for a season." Both Greek versions, as will be seen, render <span class="accented">barar</span>, "choose" - a meaning it has in the pual - and both omit one of the clauses. In this the Greek versions have the support of the Peshitta, which renders, "And (some) of the wise shall be overthrown to choose among them, and that they may understand to the end, because it is again protracted for a season." Here, too, the last of the clauses descriptive of the effect of the fall of the wise is omitted. Although the Vulgate supports the Massoretic in this, we feel it suspicious. <span class="accented">And some of them of understanding shall fall.</span> Though marvellously successful, yet Judas and his comrades suffered some reverses; the reference may be to those that fell in battle. The rendering in Theodotion would seem to point to some apostatizing. We have no record of any such cases, yet it is not impossible that some would fall away. This would be a greater trial than defeat and the death in battle of such heroes as Eleazar, surnamed Avaran, or even of Judas Maccabaeus himself. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">try them</span>, <span class="accented">and to purge</span>, <span class="accented">and to make them white.</span> The death of teachers and of military leaders would be a severe test of the zeal and enthusiasm of the faithful. All the fearful and insincere would fall off from the ranks of the faithful. Those zealous for the Law of God would be at once tried and purified by these untoward events. This has been the experience of the Christian Church in every age. Because more a trial, therefore more purifying would be the failure of some to maintain the faith under trial. <span class="accented">Even to the time of the end</span>: <span class="accented">because it is yet for a time appointed.</span> It is in perfect accordance with the view that the purpose of the death of teachers and leaders, even their failure, is the purification of the saints, that the time of the trial should be fixed and definite.

The old translator Theodot. is correct in his rendering: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, and the lxx paraphrasing: &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c0; &#787;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, &#x3b7;&#787;&#769; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;. Similarly also Ephr. Syr. and others.<p>The den of lions is designated by &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, which the Targg. use for the Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, a cistern. From this v. Leng., Maur., and Hitzig infer that the writer had in view a funnel-shaped cistern dug out in the ground, with a moderately small opening or mouth from above, which could be covered with a stone, so that for this one night the lions had to be shut in, while generally no stone lay on the opening. The pit also into which Joseph, the type of Daniel, was let down was a cistern (<a href="/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>), and the mouth of the cistern was usually covered with a stone (<a href="/genesis/29-3.htm">Genesis 29:3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-53.htm">Lamentations 3:53</a>). It can hence scarcely be conceived how the lions, over which no angel watched, could have remained in such a subterranean cavern covered with a stone. "The den must certainly have been very capacious if, as it appears, 122 men with their wives and children could have been thrown into it immediately after one another (v. 25 [<a href="/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>]); but this statement itself only shows again the deficiency of every view of the matter," - and thus the whole history is a fiction fabricated after the type of the history of Joseph! But these critics who speak thus have themselves fabricated the idea of the throwing into the den of 122 men with women and children - for the text states no number - in order that they might make the whole narrative appear absurd.<p>We have no account by the ancients of the construction of lions' dens. Ge. Hst, in his work on Fez and Morocco, p. 77, describes the lions' dens as they have been found in Morocco. According to his account, they consist of a large square cavern under the earth, having a partition-wall in the middle of it, which is furnished with a door, which the keeper can open and close from above. By throwing in food they can entice the lions from the one chamber into the other, and then, having shut the door, they enter the vacant space for the purpose of cleaning it. The cavern is open above, its mouth being surrounded by a wall of a yard and a half high, over which one can look down into the den. This description agrees perfectly with that which is here given in the text regarding the lions' den. Finally, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488; does not denote common cisterns. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-7.htm">Jeremiah 41:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a>, &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (Hebr. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;) is a subterranean chamber into which seventy dead bodies were cast; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-15.htm">Isaiah 14:15</a>, the place of Sheol is called &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;. No reason, therefore, exists for supposing that it is a funnel-formed cistern. The mouth (&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;) of the den is not its free opening above by which one may look down into it, but an opening made in its side, through which not only the lions were brought into it, but by which also the keepers entered for the purpose of cleansing the den and of attending to the beasts, and could reach the door in the partition-wall (cf. Hst, p. 270). This opening was covered with a great flat stone, which was sealed, the free air entering to the lions from above. This also explains how, according to <a href="/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a> ff., the king was able to converse with Daniel before the removal of the stone (namely, by the opening above).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19-21</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-18.htm">Daniel 6:18-20</a>)<p>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were any of his concubines brought before him; and this sleep went from him. The king spent a sleepless night in sorrow on account of Daniel. &#1496;&#1493;&#1514;, used adverbially, in fasting, i.e., without partaking of food in the evening. &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1492;, concubina; cf. The Arab. daha&#770; and daha&#770; equals , subigere faeminam, and Gesen. Thes. p. 333. On the following morning (v. 20 [<a href="/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>]) the king rose early, at the dawn of day, and went to the den of lions, and with lamentable voice called to him feebly hoping that Daniel might be delivered by his God whom he continually served. Daniel answered the king, thereby showing that he had been preserved; whereupon the king was exceeding glad. The future or imperf. &#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (<a href="/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19</a>) is not to be interpreted with Kranichfeld hypothetically, he thought to rise early, seeing he did actually rise early, but is used instead of the perf. to place the clause in relation to the following, meaning: the king, as soon as he arose at morning dawn, went hastily by the early light. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1492;&#1488;, at the shining of the light, serves for a nearer determination of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, at the morning dawn, namely, as soon as the first rays of the rising sun appeared. The predicate the living God is occasioned by the preservation of life, which the king regarded as possible, and probably was made known to the king in previous conversations with Daniel; cf. <a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-36.htm">1 Samuel 17:36</a>, etc.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22-24</a> (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-21.htm">Daniel 6:21-23</a>)<p>In his answer Daniel declares his innocence, which God had recognised, and on that account had sent His angel (cf. <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>.) to shut the mouths of the lions; cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33</a>. &#1493;&#1488;&#1507;, and also (concluding from the innocence actually testified to by God) before the king, i.e., according to the king's judgment, he had done nothing wrong or hurtful. By his transgression of the edict he had not done evil against the king's person. This Daniel could the more certainly say, the more he perceived how the king was troubled and concerned about his preservation, because in Daniel's transgression he himself had seen no conspiracy against his person, but only fidelity toward his own God. The king hereupon immediately gave command that he should be brought out of the den of lions. The Aph. &#1492;&#1504;&#1505;&#1511;&#1492; and the Hoph. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1511;, to not come from &#1504;&#1505;&#1511;, but from &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;; the  &#1504;is merely compensative. &#1505;&#1500;&#1511;, to mount up, Aph. to bring out; by which, however, we are not to understand a being drawn up by ropes through the opening of the den from above. The bringing out was by the opened passage in the side of the den, for which purpose the stone with the seals was removed. To make the miracle of his preservation manifest, and to show the reason of it, v. 24 (<a href="/daniel/6-23.htm">Daniel 6:23</a>) states that Daniel was found without any injury, because he had trusted in his God.</body></html>
