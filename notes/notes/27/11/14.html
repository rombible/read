We appear to be within “a very few days” (see <a href="/daniel/11-20.htm" title="Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.">Daniel 11:20</a>) of the vile-person who corresponds to the little horn of the fourth beast. At this period the king of the south suffers from many hostile opponents, while certain others, more closely connected with the Jews, become prominent for a while, but then fail. The obscurity of the Hebrew text was felt by the LXX., and distinct historical allusions can be found by those only who are determined to find them. These are stated to be some insurrections during the early years of Ptolemy Epiphanes, and a league which some of the Jews made with Antiochus the Great against Ptolemy.<p><span class= "bld">Robbers of thy people.—</span>This difficult expression occurs only in five other passages (<a href="/psalms/17-4.htm" title="Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.">Psalm 17:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-9.htm" title="No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:">Isaiah 35:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm" title="Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?

The kings of Egypt and Syria are noticed: Judea was between their dominions, and affected by their contests. From ver. 5-30, is generally considered to relate to the events which came to pass during the continuance of these governments; and from ver. 21, to relate to Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a cruel and violent persecutor of the Jews. See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass. While the potsherds of the earth strive with each other, they prevail and are prevailed against, deceive and are deceived; but those who know God will trust in him, and he will enable them to stand their ground, bear their cross, and maintain their conflict.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south - Against the king of Egypt. That is, not only Antiochus the Great, who was always opposed to him, and who was constantly waging war with him, but also others with whom he would be particularly involved, or who would be opposed to him. The reference is especially to Philip, king of Macedon, and to Agathocles, who excited a rebellion against him in Egypt. See Jerome on <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>; Polybius, xv. 20; Lengerke, "in loc.;" and Prideaux, iii. 198. Antiochus and Philip of Macedon entered into an agreement to invade the dominions of Ptolemy Epiphanes, and to divide them between themselves. At the same time a treasonable plot was laid against the life of Ptolemy by Scopas the AEtolian (Polyb. xvii.), who had under his command the army of the Egyptians, and who designed to take advantage of the youth of the king, and seize upon the throne. This project was defeated by the vigilance of Aristomenes, the prime minister. - Prideaux, iii. 181. See also the account of the conspiracy of Agathocles, and his sister Agathoclea, against Ptolemy, when an infant, in Prideaux, iii. 168, seq. These facts fully accord with what is said in the passage before us.<p>Also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves - The angel here turns to Daniel, and states what would be done in these circumstances by his own people - the Jews. It is to be remembered that, in these times, they were alternately under the dominion of the Egyptian and the Syrian monarchs - of Ptolemy and of Antiochus. The principal seat of the wars between Syria and Egypt was Palestine - the border land between them and Judea, therefore, often changed masters. Ptolemy Philopater had subdued Coelo-Syria and Palestine, and Ptolemy Epiphanes came into possession of them when he ascended the throne. But the angel now says that a portion of his people would take occasion, from the weakness of the youthful monarch of Egypt, and the conspiracies in his own kingdom, and the foreign combinations against him, to attempt to throw off his authority, and to become independent. That part of the people who would attempt to do this is designated in the common translation as "the robbers of thy people."<p>This, however, is scarcely a correct version, and does not properly indicate the persons that would be engaged in the plot. The marginal reading is, "children of robbers." The Latin Vulgate, "filii quoque proevaricatorum populi tui." The Greek renders it &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  hoi huioi to&#772;n loimo&#772;n tou laou sou - "the sons of the pests of thy people." Lengerke renders it, "the most powerful people of thy nation " - die gewaltsam sten Leute deines Volkes. The Hebrew word (&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;  pa&#770;r&#305;&#770;yts) means, properly, "rending, ravenous" - as of wild beasts, <a href="/isaiah/35-9.htm">Isaiah 35:9</a>; and then "violent, rapacious; an opressor, robber." - Gesenius, Lexicon The reference here seems to be to the mighty ones of the nation; the chiefs, or rulers - but a name is given them that would properly denote their character for oppression and rapacity.<p>It would seem - what is indeed probable from the circumstances of the case - that the nation was not only subject to this foreign authority, but that those who were placed over it, under that foreign authority, and who were probably mainly of their own people, were also themselves tyrannical and oppressive in their character. These subordinate rulers, however, preferred the authority of Antiochus to that of Ptolemy, and on the occasion of his return from the conquests of Coelo-Syria and Samaria, they met him, and professed submission to him. - Josephus, "Ant." b. xii. ch. iii. Section 3. "The Jews," says Josephus, "of their own accord, went over to him, and received him into the city (Jerusalem), and gave plentiful provision to his army, and to his elephants, and readily assisted him when he besieged the garrison which was in the citadel of Jerusalem." On this occasion, Josephus says that Antiochus bestowed many favors on the Jews; wrote letters to the generals of his armies commending their conduct; published a decree respecting the piety of the Jewish people, and sent an epistle to Ptolemy, stating what he had done for them, and what he desired should be further done. See these statments and letters in Josephus, "ut supra."<p>To establish the vision - That is, to bring to pass what is seen in the vision, and what had been predicted in regard to the Hebrew people. Their conduct in this matter shall have an important bearing on the fulfillment of the prophecy pertaining to that people - shall be one of the links in the chain of events securing its accomplishment. The angel does not say that it was a part of their "design" to "establish the vision," but that that would be the "result" of what they did. No doubt their conduct in this matter had a great influence on the series of events that contributed to the accomplishment of that prediction. Lengerke supposes that the "vision" here refers to that spoken of in <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>.<p>But they shall fall - They shall not succeed in the object which they have in view. Their conduct in the affair will indeed promote the fulfillment of the "vision," but it will not secure the ends which "they" have in view - perhaps their own aggrandizement; or the favor of Antiochus toward themselves; or the permanent separation of the nation from the Egyptian rule, or the hope that their country might become independent altogether. As a matter of fact, Antiochus subsequently, on his return from Egypt (198 b.c.), took Jerusalem, and killed many of the party of Ptolemy, who had given themselves up to him, though he showed particular favor to those who had adhered to the observance of their own law, and could not be prevailed on by the king of Egypt to apostatize from it. - Prideaux, iii. 198; Jos.

The king of Egypt, Ptolemy Epiphanes being a minor; and while he was such, Antiochus king of Syria, and Philip king of Macedon, joined in alliance together, as before observed, to seize upon his kingdom, and divide it between them; and accordingly Antiochus began the war in Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and Philip went against Egypt and Samos, or Caria, according to Polybius (q). Agathocles and Agathoclea, favourites of the former king of Egypt, laid a scheme of taking the regency into their hands during the minority of the young king; and these, being persons of dissolute lives, were hated by the Egyptians, which caused insurrections and seditions among themselves; and Scopas, a principal general in the army of the king of Egypt, formed a design of taking the government to himself: <p>also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision: this is directed to the Prophet Daniel, and respects the Jews his countrymen, at least some of them, refractory persons that broke through all laws of God and men; seditious men, disturbers of the public peace, and who lived upon the spoil and plunder of others; these either took the advantage of the disturbances in Egypt, and went thither, and plundered what they could, in a bold and audacious manner, and so helped to fulfil this prophecy; or during the troubles in their own land, through the kings of Egypt and Syria, took the opportunity of committing thefts and robberies in a very daring manner, whereby they brought upon them those evils threatened in the law to such persons; and particularly when the Egyptians prevailed, they sided with them against Antiochus, especially such who apostatized from their religion to please the king of Egypt; but were afterwards punished by Antiochus, as it follows: <p>but they shall fall: be cut off and destroyed, as those apostates that were of Ptolemy's party were by Antiochus, when he invaded Judea, and became master of Jerusalem; see third Maccabees chapter one. Some understand this of the apostate Jews, who fled with Onias the high priest to Egypt, and were there honourably received by Ptolemy, and obtained leave to build a temple there, under pretence of fulfilling the vision or prophecy in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/19-19.htm">Isaiah 19:19</a>, which continued many years to the times of the Romans, by whom it was destroyed; but this does not agree with the reign of this king of Egypt; for it was in the times of Ptolemy Philometor that this affair happened, as Josephus (r) relates.

Within a year or two, as soon as his war with Attalus of Pergamum was over, Antiochus marched against Scopas, and defeated him with great loss at Paneion, by the sources of the Jordan (cf. Polyb. xvi. 18 f.), so that he was obliged to retreat, with 100,000 men, into Sidon, where Antiochus besieged him, and, though Ptolemy sent him assistance, compelled him to surrender (b.c. 198). After this Antiochus recovered Batanaea, Samaria, Abila and Gadara: he then entered Jerusalem, where the people received him gladly, provided his army with food, and assisted him to expel the garrison left in the citadel by Scopas; in return for this friendliness, Antiochus afterwards granted the Jews remission of many taxes, and contributed liberally to both the services and the repair of the Temple[365].

The versions here differ from this, which represents the Massoretic with fair accuracy. The LXX. renders, "And in those times thoughts (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) shall rise against the King of Egypt, and he shall build again that which has fallen down of thy people " - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">oobanah</span>), "and he shall build," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">oobenee</span>), "and sons of;" he has read also <span class="accented">peratzee</span>, "breaches," instead of <span class="accented">peritzee</span>, "robbers," - "and he shall raise himself up" - reading singular instead of plural  - "to fulfil the prophecy, and they shall stumble." This confusion indicates that the reading of the LXX. is mistaken. Theodotion is as much removed from the Massoretic as is the above, "And in those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the sons of the plagues (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) of thy people shall be exalted to establish the vision, and they shall become weak." If there were any trace of uncertainty in the reading at this point, we might be tempted to read <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, written <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x397;&#x399;&#x39e;&#x3a4;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x39f;&#x399;&#x39c;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span>. The reading of Nestle (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is no improvement. The Peshitta renders, "And many shall rise against the king of the north, and the sons of the perversity of thy people shall be raised up to fulfil the vision, and shall be cast down." The change from "king of the south" to "the king of the north" must be noted, probably simply the result of blunder. The Vulgate renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="accented">pre-varieatorum</span>, <span class="accented">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south.</span> Ptolemy Epiphanes was not only exposed to the assault of the confederates Antiochus and Philip of Macedon; but there were intrigues and conspiracies in the palace. <span class="accented">Also</span> <span class="accented">the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the sons of the oppressors.</span> Commentators of all varieties have assumed that these are Jews. Hitzig maintains that they were the Jews that sided with Antiochus's rule ('Historical Exposition of Daniel'); that they were the separatists, those who had gone down to Egypt (Calvin; Behrmann, 'Die Stiirmische Jugend'); Keil, "violent men who break through Divine law." So Kranichfeld and Wordsworth. Stuart, "the violent of thy people;" Ewald, "young high-handed men." Fuller thinks the word <span class="accented">prizzeem</span> is used as "rulers." Griitz would render, "to establish the vision, to make the law to totter " - an attempt to get, by addition to the text, an explanation. The Hebrew text does not bear out this meaning. Gratz here implies <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hazion</span>), "vision," to be equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>), "law;" but this is never the case. But the oppressors of the people do not necessarily belong to it. <span class="accented">To establish the vision</span> (comp. <a href="/acts/4-28.htm">Acts 4:28</a>). It may be that here there is a portion of the original vision of Daniel, which has been overlaid with what we have before us. It is a summary of the whole history of the Jews under the Greek domination. <span class="accented">But they shall fall.</span> A general statement true of all the oppressors of Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel now read the writing (<a href="/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25</a>), and gave its interpretation (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-26.htm">Daniel 5:26-28</a>). The writing bears the mysterious character of the oracle. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, &#1502;&#1504;&#1488; (<a href="/daniel/5-28.htm">Daniel 5:28</a>) are partic. Piel, and the forms &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1500; and &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;, are chosen on account of their symphony with &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; is generally regarded as partic. plur., but that would be &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503;; it much rather appears to be a noun form, and plur. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;  equals  Hebr. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; (cf. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503;, <a href="/zechariah/11-16.htm">Zechariah 11:16</a>), in the sense of broken pieces, fragments, for &#1508;&#1512;&#1505; signifies to divide, to break in pieces, not only in the Hebr. (cf. <a href="/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-32.htm">Psalm 69:32</a>), but also in the Chald., <a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm">2 Kings 4:39</a> (Targ.), although in the Targg. The meaning to spread out prevails. In all the three words there lies a double sense, which is brought out in the interpretation. &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;, for the sake of the impression, or perhaps only of the parallelism, is twice given, so as to maintain two members of the verse, each of two words. In the numbering lies the determination and the completion, or the conclusion of a manner, a space of time. Daniel accordingly interprets &#1502;&#1504;&#1488; thus: God has numbered (&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; for &#1502;&#1504;&#1488;, perf. act.) thy kingdom, i.e., its duration or its days, &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;&#1468;, and has finished it, i.e., its duration is so counted out that it is full, that it now comes to an end. In &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500; there lies the double sense that the word &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, to weigh, accords with the Niphal of &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, to be light, to be found light (cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, <a href="/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). The interpretation presents this double meaning: Thou art weighed in the balances (&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;) and art found too light (like the &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;). &#1495;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, wanting in necessary weight, i.e., deficient in moral worth. &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;, a perf. formed from the partic. Piel; cf. Winer, 13, 2. As to the figure of the balance, cf. <a href="/job/31-6.htm">Job 31:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a> (9).<p>For &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25</a>) Daniel uses in the interpretation the sing. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, which, after the analogy of &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1500;, may be regarded as partic. Piel, and he interprets it accordingly, so that he brings out, along with the meaning lying in the word, also the allusion to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;, Persian: thy kingdom is divided, or broken into pieces, and given to the Medes and Persians. The meaning is not that the kingdom was to be divided into two equal parts, and the one part given to the Medes and the other to the Persians; but &#1508;&#1512;&#1505; is to divide into pieces, to destroy, to dissolve the kingdom. This shall be effected by the Medes and Persians, and was so brought about when the Persian Cyrus with the united power of the Medes and Persians destroyed Babylon, and thus put an end to the Chaldean kingdom, whereby the kingdom was transferred first to the Median Darius (<a href="/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a> [<a href="/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>]), and after him to the Persian Cyrus. In the naming of the Median before the Persian there lies, as already remarked in the Introduction, a notable proof of the genuineness of this narrative, and with it of the whole book; for the hegemony of the Medes was of a very short duration, and after its overthrow by the Persians the form of expression used is always "Persians and Medes," as is found in the book of Esther. </body></html>
