See what decaying, perishing things worldly pomp and possessions are, and the power by which they are gotten. God, in his providence, sets up one, and pulls down another, as he pleases. This world is full of wars and fightings, which come from men's lusts. All changes and revolutions of states and kingdoms, and every event, are plainly and perfectly foreseen by God. No word of God shall fall to the ground; but what he has designed, what he has declared, shall infallibly come to pass.

He alludes here to what he had done on a former occasion to promote the interests of the Hebrew people, and to secure those arrangements which were necessary for their welfare - particularly in the favorable disposition of Darius the Mede toward them.<p>In the first year of Darius the Mede - See the notes at <a href="/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a>. He does not here state the things contemplated or done by Darius in which he had confirmed or strengthened him, but there can be no reasonable doubt that it was the purpose which he had conceived to restore the Jews to their own land, and to give them permission to rebuild their city and temple. Compare <a href="/daniel/9-1.htm">Daniel 9:1</a>. It was in that year that Daniel offered his solemn prayer, as recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>; in that year that, according to the time predicted by Jeremiah (see <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>), the captivity would terminate; and in that year that an influence from above led the mind of the Persian king to contemplate the restoration of the captive people. Cyrus was, indeed, the one through whom the edict for their return was promulgated; but as he reigned under his uncle Cyaxares or Darius, and as Cyaxares was the source of authority, it is evident that his mind must have been influenced to grant this favor, and it is to this that the angel here refers.<p>I stood to confirm and to strengthen him - Compare the notes at <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>. It would seem that the mind of Darius was not wholly decided; that there were adverse influences bearing on it: that there were probably counselors of his realm who advised against the proposed measures, and the angel here says that he stood by him, and confirmed him in his purpose, and secured the execution of his benevolent plan. Who can prove that an angel may not exert an influence on the heart of kings? And what class of men is there who, when they intend to do good and right, are more likely to have their purposes changed by evil counselors than kings; and who are there that more need a heavenly influence to confirm their design to do right? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 11<p>Da 11:1-45.

These words more properly belong to the preceding chapter, and should have concluded that, and the "eleventh" chapter should have begun in the next verse; and they are not the words of Daniel, as Jerom and others; but of the angel telling Daniel, not only what he had been lately doing, and would do in the court of Persia for his people; but what he had done in the beginning of that monarchy, the very first year that Darius the Mede became king of Babylon, and head of the whole monarchy; see <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>, the Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "in the first year of Cyrus"; which was the same time; for Darius and Cyrus reigned together. <p>Even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him; not Michael your Prince, as Jarchi; for he being no other than the Son of God, an uncreated Angel, needed not the help and assistance of a created one, nor could receive any strength and confirmation from such an one; unless this is to be understood, not with respect to Michael himself abstractly considered, but as in relation to the people of the Jews, on whose side Michael was; and so this angel took part with him and them, and as his minister served them both, in defending them, and taking care of their affairs at this time; so Jacchiades paraphrases it, to confirm and strengthen Israel: but it seems rather to design Darius, and the sense to be, that this angel strengthened Darius and Cyrus in their good intentions to let the people of Israel go free and give them full liberty and encouragement to go into their own land, and rebuild their city and temple; about which some doubts and hesitations might arise in their minds, and objections be made by some of their nobles and courtiers to it, being moved and influenced by an evil spirit, the adversary of this good angel; but he attended them so closely, and so strongly suggested to them what they should do in this case, that he carried his point on behalf of the Jews; for this respects not so much the destruction of the Chaldean monarchy, and the establishing the Persian monarchy on the ruins of it, and settling Darius on the throne, and strengthening his kingdom and interest, as the confirmation of him and Cyrus in their designs in favour of the Jews. The Syriac version is, "from the first year of Darius the Mede, he rose up to help me, and assist me"; as if the angel was still speaking of Michael, who came to his help against the prince of Persia, and was the only one that held with him, and had done so from the beginning of the Persian empire; but the Hebrew text will not admit of such a translation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, <i>even</i> I, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</span><p>(a) The angel assures Daniel that God has given him power to perform these things, seeing that he appointed him to assist Darius when he overcame the Chaldeans.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><a href="/daniel/11-1.htm" title="Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him."><span class="bld">Daniel 11:1</a></span>. <span class="bld">And as for me</span>, <span class="ital">in</span> … <span class="bld">I stood up to be a supporter</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">a stronghold unto him</span>] I myself, also, in the first year of Darius, came forward to support Michael.

The rendering of the LXX. is, "In the first year of Cyrus the king, he told me to be strong and to play the man." Theodotion's rendering is yet briefer, "And I, in the first year of Cyrus, stood in strength and might." The Peshitta rendering, "In the first year of Darius the Mede (he) arose to confirm and strengthen me." The Vulgate is close to the Massoretic and the English versions, "I likewise, from the first year of Darius the Mede, was standing that he might be confirmed and strengthened." The Revised Version does not differ seriously from the Authorized, "And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him." The Septuagint must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">amar</span>), "he said," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">anee</span>), "I." When we have the Septuagint and Theodotion supporting each other against the Massoretic text, the evidence against the received text is strong. In this case both these versions have, as will be seen, not "Darius," but "Cyrus." The two names would have in the old Egyptian Hebrew script, a striking resemblance to each other; the fact that the last letter of both names is the same, and also the second letter, made the likeness considerable in any script; but  the first letter of "Darius" is certainly very like  the first letter of" Cyrus." The <span class="accented">vav</span> would possibly be omitted, then the first two letters of either name would resemble closely the first two letters of the  other, and the final letters are the same. Mistake, then, was easy. The first letter of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d3;</span> is the same, and the words would be liable to be read in accordance with that given to the proper name. Further, all the versions but the Vulgate make the speaker the recipient of the aid. Theodotion may be taken as doubtful The difference is slight, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5db;&#x5d3;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The Septuagint seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span>. The first two letters are thus the same, the <span class="accented">daleth</span> may have been an intrusion. Bevan and Behrmann would omit the date as spurious, and hold it to have been introduced because the previous four chapters begin each with a date. This reason, to have weight, must assume the division into chapters to be of ancient date, more ancient than the Septuagint Version. The fact that all the versions have it compels us to admit a date here, but, as we have said above, it is to be reckoned by the year, not of Darius, but of Cyrus. (<span class="accented">Also I</span>) <span class="accented">in the first year of Cyrus the king.</span> The first year of Cyrus was the year when he decided to set the Jews free, and permit them to return to their own land; but the first year in this case was reckoned from his assumption of the throne of Babylon. We saw reason to doubt whether the reference in the beginning of ch. 10. was to the Babylonian reign of Cyrus, or to his reign as King of the Persians. His first year as King of the Persians might be when he first began to turn his arms against Babylon. We do not know enough of the history of the first years of Cyrus's monarchy to know what critical events befell in that rear. <span class="accented">Stood to confirm and strengthen him</span> (<span class="accented">me</span>). According to the Massoretic text, the angel Gabriel stood to confirm either the archangel Michael or King Darius. Certainly, as Darius (Cyrus) is the nearer substantive, the grammatical preference would be to take it, as do Havernick, Hitzig, and Calvin. The majority of commentators who hold by the Massoretic text take "him" to refer to Michael - and much can be said for this. Although Darius (Cyrus) is the nearest substantive, yet he is not the subject of the main sentence, but merely denotes a time, therefore a previous substantive must be chosen. In the opening of Cyrus's career, the intimate connection his prosperity had with the prosperity of the people of Israel might well make Michael interested. As Cyrus had been prophesied of, he was under the rule of the angel of prophecy, hence Gabriel strengthened and confirmed the efforts of Michael. Certainly "strengthening" and "confirming" are strong terms to apply to the archangel Michael, yet we know so little of angelic natures and their limitations that the phrase may be quite natural. The meaning is not materially altered if we read, "He stood to strengthen and confirm me." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The asyndeton &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; is in apposition to &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; as explanatory of it: the wise men, namely the conjurers, who are mentioned instar omnium. &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; with the imperf. following is not the relative particle, but the conjunction that before the clause expressive of design, and the infinitive clause dependent on the clause of design going before: that you may read the writing to make known to me the interpretation. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488; is not the mysterious writing  equals  word, discourse, but the writing with its wonderful origin; thus, the matter of which he wishes to know the meaning.</body></html>
