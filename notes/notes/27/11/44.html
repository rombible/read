While in Egypt he has bad news brought to him from the north and from the east, which stirs up feelings of revenge. Once again he halts in Palestine, where he comes to an end. That this cannot apply to Antiochus is evident from the following facts—(1) Antiochus was in Persia when the news of the defeat of Lysias reached him; (2) Judæa and Jerusalem cannot in any sense be regarded as either east or north of Persia; (3) Antiochus died in Persia, and not near Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/daniel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/daniel/11-44.htm" title="But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many....">Daniel 11:44-45</a>. </span><span class="ital">But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him — </span>Historians relate, that the Parthians on the east, and the Armenians on the north, declared war against Antiochus about the same time; so that this may very reasonably be supposed to relate to this fact. <span class="ital">And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace — </span>The word translated <span class="ital">palace </span>here, is a Syriac word, and therefore is very properly used when speaking of the Syrian king. The expression signifies, as we would speak now, his royal tent, or pavilion. By planting it <span class="ital">between the seas, </span>in the glorious holy mountain, is meant, his fixing it in Judea, called a mountain elsewhere, as well as here, because it is a mountainous country. The epithet <span class="ital">glorious </span>is the very same as Daniel generally uses in speaking of Judea as a peculiar mark of distinction. The epithet <span class="ital">holy </span>is also frequently applied to Judea, because the whole of it was dedicated to the true God, and was chosen by him for the residence of a nation which he intended to be a holy people. Judea is likewise situated between two seas, namely, the Mediterranean, and the sea of Sodom, or the Dead sea; which are its boundaries on each side. So the meaning of this sentence is, that Antiochus should place his royal pavilion in Judea, leaving there some of his principal generals, or officers, who should, by his command, keep up the pomp of majesty as if he himself were present. <span class="ital">Yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him — </span>God shall cut him off in the midst of his days, and none shall be able to prevent his fall. This is the same with what is foretold <a href="/daniel/8-25.htm" title="And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.">Daniel 8:25</a>, <span class="ital">He shall be broken without hand; </span>where see the note. Observe, reader, when God’s time is come to bring proud oppressors to their end, none shall be able, nor perhaps, inclined to help them, for those who, when they are in their grandeur, covet to be feared by all, will find, when they come to be in distress, that they are loved by none: none will lend them so much as a hand, or a prayer to help them: for if the Lord do not help, who shall? Of the kings that came after Antiochus nothing is here prophesied, for he was the most malicious, mischievous enemy to the church, and a type of <span class="ital">the son of perdition, </span>whom the Lord will <span class="ital">consume with the breath of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming, and none shall help him. </span>As a confirmation of the explanation of this prophecy given above, it may be proper to observe here, that Calmet, in like manner, confines the latter part of it to the persecutions of Antiochus against the Jews. He observes, however, at the close of the chapter, it is necessary to acknowledge that Antiochus was one of the most manifest, and most expressive figures of antichrist, and that these things which the angel foretold of Antiochus will receive a further accomplishment before the end of the world. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:31-45 The remainder of this prophecy is very difficult, and commentators differ much respecting it. From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him - Shall disturb him, or alarm him. That is, he will hear something from those quarters that will disarrange all his other plans, or that will summon him forth in his last and final expedition - on that expedition in which "he will come to his end" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>, or which will be the end of this series of historical events. The reference here is to the winding up of this series of transactions, and, according to the view taken on <a href="/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a> (see the note at that place), it is not necessary to suppose that this would happen immediately after what is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-43.htm">Daniel 11:43</a>, but it is rather to be regarded as a statement of what would occur in the end, or of the manner in which the person here referred to would finally come to an end, or in which these events would be closed. As a matter of fact, Antiochus, as will be seen in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>, was called forth in a warlike expedition by tidings or reports from Parthia and Armenia - regions lying to the east and the north, and it was in this expedition that he lost his life, and that this series of historical events was closed. Lengerke says, Antiochus assembled an army to take vengeance on the Jews, who, after the close of the unfortunate campaign in Egypt, rose up, under the Maccabees, against Antiochus, 1 Macc. 3:10, following Then the intelligence that the Parthians in the east, and the Armenians in the north, had armed themselves for war against him, alarmed him. So Tacitus (Hist. v. 8) says (Antiochus Judaeis), Demere superstitionem et mores Groecorum dare adnixus, quominus teterrimain gentem in melius mutaret, Parthorum bello prohibitus est, nam ea tempestate Arsaces defecerat. In the year 147 b.c., Antiochus went on the expedition to Persia and Armenia, on the return from which he died. The occasions for this were these:<p>(a) Artaxias, the king of Armenia, who was his vassal, had revolted from him, and<p>(b) he sought to replenish his exhausted treasury, that he might wage the war with Judas Maccabeus.<p>See 1 Macc. 3:27-37; Jos. Ant. b. xii. ch. vii. Section 2; Appian, Syriac. xlvi. 80; Porphyry, in Jerome, in loc.<p>Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy ... - Great fury at the revolt of Artaxias, and especially at this juncture when he was waging war with the Jews; and great fury at the Jews, with a determination to obtain the means utterly to destroy them. 1 Macc. 3:27: "Now when king Antiochus heard these things (the successes of Judas Maceabeus), he was full of indignation." In every way his wrath was kindled. He was enraged against the Jews on account of their success; he was enraged against Artaxias for revolting from him; he was enraged because his treasury was exhausted, and he had not the means of prosecuting the war. In this mood of mind he crossed the Euphrates (1 Macc. 3:37) to prosecute the war in the East, and, as it is said here, "utterly to make away many." Everything conspired to kindle his fury, and in this state of mind, he went forth on his last expedition to the East. Nothing, in fact, could better describe the state of mind of Antiochus than the language used here by the angel to Daniel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>44. tidings out of the east and out of the north&#8212;Artaxias, king of Armenia, his vassal, had revolted in the north, and Arsaces, leader of the Parthians, in the east (1 Maccabees 3:10, &c., 1 Maccabees 3:37; Tacitus, Histories, 5.8).

The version of the Septuagint is very like this, "A rumour out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him, and he shall come out in great rage to lay waste with the sword, and to slay many." The version of Theodotion is somewhat briefer, "Rumours and disturbances out of the east and from the north shall trouble him, and he shall come in much wrath to destroy many." The Syriac is closer than any other version to the Massoretic text. The Vulgate renders, "A rumour out of the east and north shall trouble him, and he shall come with a great multitude that he may beat down and slay many." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">hayma</span>) may mean either "wrath" or "multitude." It is difficult to identify the rumours that recalled Antiochus from his conquests. The account given by Porphyry (quoted by Jerome) of his receiving news that led him to ravage the coasts of Phoenicia and march against Armenia are unsupported by other historians. A phrase in Tacitus ('Hist.,' 5:8) seems to throw light on this, "After the Macedonians held the supremacy, King Antiochus, when he was endeavouring to change the superstition of this people, <span class="accented">i.e. </span> the Jews, into the manners of the Greeks, was hindered by a Parthian war." There is, however, no record of such a Parthian war; but such a war may have arisen, and not be recorded, as the histories for the period before us are very incomplete. Should we regard these verses as giving another account of the war between Epiphanes and Ptolemy, the tidings out of the north might mean the arrival of the Roman envoys, headed by Popilius Lsenas. If there were also a threat of a Parthian invasion, we should then have, "tidings put of the east and north." <span class="accented">Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy</span>, <span class="accented">and utterly to make away many.</span> Certainly Antiochus did return furious from the expedition in which he was stayed by the Romans; and certainly also he set himself thereafter  to compel the Jews to become Greeks in religion, punishing with death refusal to yield to his demands (1 Macc. 1:24-28; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:05. 3). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25-27</a>)<p>The consequences of this occurrence.<p>As Nebuchadnezzar, after the wonderful deliverance of Daniel's friends from the burning fiery furnace, issued an edict to all the nations of his kingdom forbidding them on pain of death from doing any injury to these men of God (<a href="/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>), so now Darius, in consequence of this wonderful preservation of Daniel in the den of lions, gave forth an edict commanding all the nations of his whole kingdom to fear and reverence Daniel's God. But as Nebuchadnezzar by his edict, so also Darius, did not depart from the polytheistic standpoint. Darius acknowledged the God of Daniel, indeed, as the living God, whose kingdom and dominion were everlasting, but not as the only true God, and he commanded Him to be reverenced only as a God who does wonders in heaven and on earth, without prejudice to the honour of his own gods and of the gods of his subjects. Both of these kings, it is true, raised the God of Judea above all other gods, and praised the everlasting duration of His dominion (see <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>, 32 [<a href="/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a>]f., and <a href="/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a> [<a href="/daniel/3-28.htm">Daniel 3:28</a>]ff., <a href="/daniel/6-27.htm">Daniel 6:27</a> [<a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>]f.), but they did not confess Him as the one only God. This edict, the, shows neither the conversion of Darius to the worship of the God of the Jews, nor does it show intolerance toward the gods of his subjects. On v. 26 (<a href="/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>) cf. <a href="/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a> (<a href="/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>). As Nebuchadnezzar, so also Darius, regarded his kingdom as a world-kingdom. On 27a (<a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>) cf. <a href="/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>. The reverence which all the nations were commanded to show to Daniel's God is described in the same words as is the fear and reverence which the might and greatness of Nebuchadnezzar inspired in all the nations that were subject to him (<a href="/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>), which has led Hitzig justly to remark, that the words &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; (they must worship his God) are not used. God is described as living (cf. v. 21 [<a href="/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>]) and eternal, with which is connected the praise of the everlasting duration of His dominion, and of His rule in heaven and on earth; cf. <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and <a href="/daniel/3-33.htm">Daniel 3:33</a> (<a href="/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3</a>).
