From Antiochus the account seems to pass to antichrist. Reference seems to be made to the Roman empire, the fourth monarchy, in its pagan, early Christian, and papal states. The end of the Lord's anger against his people approaches, as well as the end of his patience towards his enemies. If we would escape the ruin of the infidel, the idolater, the superstitious and cruel persecutor, as well as that of the profane, let us make the oracles of God our standard of truth and of duty, the foundation of our hope, and the light of our paths through this dark world, to the glorious inheritance above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver - See the notes at <a href="/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>. Having seized upon the most important places in Egypt, and having possession of the person of the king, he would, of course, have the wealth of Egypt at his disposal, and would return to his land laden with spoils.<p>And over all the precious things of Egypt - The rich lands, the public buildings, the contents of the royal palace, the works of art, and the monuments, and books, and implements of war. All these would, of course, be at the disposal of the conqueror.<p>And the Libyans - The word Libyans, in the Hebrew Scriptures, is everywhere joined with the Egyptians and Ethiopians. They are supposed to have been a people of Egyptian origin, and their country bordered on Egypt in the west. See Tanner's Ancient Atlas. A conquest of Egypt was almost in itself a conquest of Libya.<p>And the Ethiopians - Hebrew, Cushites - &#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  kush&#305;&#770;ym. On the general meaning of the word Cush or Ethiopia in the Scriptures, see the note at <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>. The reference here, undoubtedly, is to the African Cush or Ethiopia, which bounded Egypt on the south. This country comprehended not only Ethiopia above Syene and the Cataracts, but likewise Thebais or Upper Egypt. A subjugation of Egypt would be, in fact, almost a conquest of this land.<p>Shall be at his steps - Gesenius renders this, "in his company." The word means properly step, or walk. Compare <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24</a>. The Vulgate renders this, "And he shall pass also through Libya and Ethiopia." The Greek, "and he shall have power over all the secret treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and of the Libyans, and of the Ethiopians, in their strongholds." Lengerke renders it, "And the Libyans and Ethiopians shall follow his steps." The proper sense of the Hebrew would be, that they accompanied him; that they marched with him or followed him; and the phrase would be applicable either to those who were allies, or who were led captive. The more probable idea would be that they were allies, or were associated with him, than that they were captives. I do not know that there are any distinct historical facts which show the truth of what is here predicted respecting Antiochus, but it cannot be considered as improbable that the prophecy was fulfilled, for<p>(a), as already observed, these nations, naturally allied to Egypt as being a part of the same people, bounded Egypt on the west and on the south;<p>(b) in the days of Ezekiel E<a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/30-4.htm">Zechariah 30:4-5</a>, we find that they were actually confederated with Egypt in a "league," and that the calamity which fell upon Egypt, also fell directly upon Ethiopia and Libya; and<p>(c) the possession of Egypt, therefore, would be naturally followed with the subjugation of these places, or it might be presumed that they would seek the alliance and friendship of one who had subdued it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42, 43.

The land of Egypt, as it is a very large, so a very rich country, abounding with gold, silver, and precious things; all which came into the hands of the Turk along with it; for when Selim, the ninth emperor of the Turks, conquered the Mamalucs he caused five hundred of the chiefest Egyptian families to be transported to Constantinople; as likewise a great number of Mamalucs' wives and children, besides the sultan's treasure, and other immense riches (b). <p>And the Lybians and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps; at his command and pleasure; shall follow him, being taken captive, or go where he orders them; that is, in all things shall be obedient to him.

These people, the Africans and Ethiopians, are near to Egypt, and therefore mentioned with it, and never were under the power of Antiochus, as Jerome observes; but are now subject to the Ottoman empire, and make a part of it; which is a very strong evidence of the Turk being the king of the north here spoken of. <p>(b) See Dr. Newton's Dissertations on the Prophecies, p. 393. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">43</span>. <span class="ital">have power</span>] lit. <span class="ital">rule</span>.

The word translated "treasures" is a late one, but evidently the Septuagint translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">maqom</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>.

The Peshitta rendering is, "And he shall have power over the house of the treasures of gold and silver, and of the pleasant things of Egypt, and the Libyans, and the Cushites (Ethiopians) are his allies." The Vulgate follows a slightly different rendering, "And he shall rule the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; through Libya and AEthiopia, too, shall he pass." Having a different reading in the last clause from the Massoretic, the natural Hebrew equivalent for <span class="accented">transibit</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ya'bor</span>) - <span class="accented">a</span> word that could scarcelv arise by mistake from that in the text. <span class="accented">He</span> <span class="accented">shall have power over the treasures of gold and silcer</span>, <span class="accented">and over all the precious things of Egypt.</span> Strictly speaking, this never was the case, as Antiochus never wholly conquered Egypt, although in that expedition, in which he had laid siege to Alexandria, he came very near completing his conquest. <span class="accented">And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall beat his steps.</span> This certainly is not true in the sense in which Jerome takes it, "he shall pass through Libya and Ethiopia." Though Antiochus more than once invaded Egypt, he never passed further into Africa. These nationalities are associated with each other; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="/jeremiah/46-8.htm">Jeremiah 46:8, 9</a>, we have, "The Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield." So in <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> we have the countries spoken of together. It may merely mean that individuals belonging to these nationalities had joined his armies. This is altogether a more ornate and poetical passage than the rest of this chapter, and gives the feeling of a different hand; therefore, probably, it belongs to a time nearer that of Daniel, and contains more of the original prophecy. Professor Fuller remarks on a reference being made to the help Ptolemy received from Cyprus. Cyprus, or Chittim, is referred to in the earlier part of this chapter, but not here. The Lubim and Cushim are contemporary with Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25-27</a>)<p>The consequences of this occurrence.<p>As Nebuchadnezzar, after the wonderful deliverance of Daniel's friends from the burning fiery furnace, issued an edict to all the nations of his kingdom forbidding them on pain of death from doing any injury to these men of God (<a href="/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>), so now Darius, in consequence of this wonderful preservation of Daniel in the den of lions, gave forth an edict commanding all the nations of his whole kingdom to fear and reverence Daniel's God. But as Nebuchadnezzar by his edict, so also Darius, did not depart from the polytheistic standpoint. Darius acknowledged the God of Daniel, indeed, as the living God, whose kingdom and dominion were everlasting, but not as the only true God, and he commanded Him to be reverenced only as a God who does wonders in heaven and on earth, without prejudice to the honour of his own gods and of the gods of his subjects. Both of these kings, it is true, raised the God of Judea above all other gods, and praised the everlasting duration of His dominion (see <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>, 32 [<a href="/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a>]f., and <a href="/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a> [<a href="/daniel/3-28.htm">Daniel 3:28</a>]ff., <a href="/daniel/6-27.htm">Daniel 6:27</a> [<a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>]f.), but they did not confess Him as the one only God. This edict, the, shows neither the conversion of Darius to the worship of the God of the Jews, nor does it show intolerance toward the gods of his subjects. On v. 26 (<a href="/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>) cf. <a href="/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31</a> (<a href="/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>). As Nebuchadnezzar, so also Darius, regarded his kingdom as a world-kingdom. On 27a (<a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>) cf. <a href="/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>. The reverence which all the nations were commanded to show to Daniel's God is described in the same words as is the fear and reverence which the might and greatness of Nebuchadnezzar inspired in all the nations that were subject to him (<a href="/daniel/5-19.htm">Daniel 5:19</a>), which has led Hitzig justly to remark, that the words &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1492;&#1468; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; (they must worship his God) are not used. God is described as living (cf. v. 21 [<a href="/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>]) and eternal, with which is connected the praise of the everlasting duration of His dominion, and of His rule in heaven and on earth; cf. <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and <a href="/daniel/3-33.htm">Daniel 3:33</a> (<a href="/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3</a>).

In v. 28 (<a href="/daniel/6-27.htm">Daniel 6:27</a>) this God is lauded as the deliverer and wonder-worker, because in the case of Daniel He had showed Himself as such; cf. <a href="/daniel/3-32.htm">Daniel 3:32</a> (<a href="/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a>). &#1497;&#1491; &#1502;&#1503;, from the hand, i.e., from the power of; cf. <a href="/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>. </body></html>
