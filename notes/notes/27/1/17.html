But we must not suppose that Daniel attained this skill by any study or rules of art.

Compare <a href="/daniel/1-6.htm">Daniel 1:6</a>.<p>God gave them knowledge and skill - See the notes at <a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>. There is no reason to suppose that in the "knowledge and skill" here referred to, it is meant to be implied that there was anything miraculous, or that there was any direct inspiration. Inspiration was evidently confined to Daniel, and pertained to what is spoken of under the head of "visions and dreams." The fact that "all" this was to be attributed to God as his gift, is in accordance with the common method of speaking in the Scriptures; and it is also in accordance with "fact," that "all" knowledge is to be traced to God. See <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2-3</a>. God formed the intellect; he preserves the exercise of reason; he furnishes us instructors; he gives us clearness of perception; he enables us to take advantage of bright thoughts and happy suggestions which occur in our own minds, as much as he sends rain, and dew, and sunshine on the fields of the farmer, and endows him with skill. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-26.htm">Isaiah 28:26</a>, "For his God doth instruct him." The knowledge and skill which we may acquire, therefore, should be as much attributed to God as the success of the farmer should. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>, "For there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding." In the case before us, there is no reason to doubt that the natural powers of these young men had been diligently applied during the three years of their trial <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-5.htm">Daniel 1:5</a>, and under the advantages of a strict course of temperance; and that the knowledge here spoken of was the result of such an application to their studies. On the meaning of the words "knowledge" and "skill" here, see the notes at <a href="/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>.<p>In all learning and wisdom - See also the notes at <a href="/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a>.<p>And Daniel had understanding - Showing that in that respect there was a special endowment in his case; a kind of knowledge imparted which could be communicated only by special inspiration. The margin is, "he made Daniel understand." The margin is in accordance with the Hebrew, but the sense is the same.<p>In all visions - On the word rendered "visions" - &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;  cha&#770;zo&#770;n - see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>, and the introduction to Isaiah, Section 7. (4). It is a term frequently employed in reference to prophecy, and designates the usual method by which future events were made known. The prophet was permitted to see those events "as if" they were made to pass before the eye, and to describe them "as if" they were objects of sight. Here the word seems to be used to denote all supernatural appearances; all that God permitted him to see that in any way shadowed forth the future. It would seem that men who were not inspired were permitted occasionally to behold such supernatural appearances, though they were not able to interpret them. Thus their attention would be particularly called to them, and they would be prepared to admit the truth of what the interpreter communicated to them. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5-6</a>; <a href="/genesis/40-5.htm">Genesis 40:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-7</a>. Daniel was so endowed that he could interpret the meaning of these mysterious appearances, and thus convey important messages to men. The same endowment had been conferred on Joseph when in Egypt. See the passages referred to in Genesis.<p>And dreams - One of the ways by which the will of God was anciently communicated to men. See Introduction to Isaiah, Section 7. (2), and the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14-18</a>. Daniel, like Joseph before him, was supernaturally endowed to explain these messages which God sent to men, or to unfold these preintimations of coming events. This was a kind of knowledge which the Chaldeans particularly sought, and on which they especially prided themselves; and it was important, in order to "stain the pride of all human glory," and to make "the wisdom of the wise" in Babylon to be seen to be comparative "folly," to endow one man from the land of the prophets in the most ample manner with this knowledge, as it was important to do the same thing at the court of Pharaoh by the superior endowments of Joseph <a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

So Joseph in the court of Pharaoh (Ge 40:5; 41:1-8). Daniel, in these praises of his own "understanding," speaks not through vanity, but by the direction of God, as one transported out of himself.

This is to be understood, not of magic art, vain philosophy, judicial astrology, to which the Chaldeans were addicted; but of learning and wisdom, laudable and useful, both in things natural and political; for these men, who scrupled eating and drinking what came from the king's table, would never indulge themselves in the study of vain, curious, and unlawful knowledge; much less would God have blessed the study of such things, and still less be said to give them knowledge and skill therein: <p>and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams; besides knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom, in languages and sciences, in common with the other young men; he had the honour of seeing very remarkable visions of future things, and of interpreting dreams; and this not by rules of art, such as the Oneirocritics use, but by the gift of God; of which many singular instances follow in this book. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> visions and dreams.</span><p>(r) Meaning in the liberal sciences, and natural knowledge, and not in the magical areas which are forbidden; De 18:11.<p>(s) So that he alone was a Prophet, and none of the others: for by dreams and visions God appeared to his Prophets; Nu 12:6</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>.<span class="bld"> Now</span> <span class="ital">as for these four</span> <span class="bld">youths</span>, <span class="ital">God gave them knowledge</span> (the word rendered <span class="ital">science</span> in <span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/1-4.htm" title="Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.">Daniel 1:4</a></span>), <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">intelligence</span> (cf. <span class="ital">intelligent, <a href="/daniel/1-4.htm" title="Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.">Daniel 1:4</a></span>) <span class="ital">in all</span> <span class="bld">literature</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/1-4.htm" title="Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.">Daniel 1:4</a></span>) <span class="ital">and wisdom</span>] ‘Wisdom’ is used here, in a concrete sense, of an intelligently arranged body of principles, or, as we should now say, <span class="ital">science</span>. The term must be understood as representing the popular estimate of the subjects referred to: for the ‘wisdom’ of the Chaldaean priests, except in so far as it took cognizance of the actual facts of astronomy, was in reality nothing but a systematized superstition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams</span>] or, ‘in <span class="ital">every kind</span> of vision and dreams.’ This was a point in which Daniel excelled the rest.

Or, as the words might be more accurately rendered, "these lads, the four of them" (<a href="/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8-10</a>). This indicates that somehow they were separated off into a quaternion. In Ezekiel, where a similar phrase cecum, the four cherubim form a quaternion in a very special way. As we have already seen, the Assyrians in a feast arranged the guests in messes of four. Those thus seated together would most likely be associated in some other way. In the case of these youths, who were permanent guests at the table of the King of Babylon, they would most likely be associated in their studies from the first. The Septuagint Version omits the numeral, but is pleonastic in a way that suggests a coalescing of different readings. The rendering is, "And to the youths the Lord gave understanding and knowledge and wisdom in the art of learning (the grammatic art - grammar), and to Daniel he gave understanding of every kind (in every word), and in visions, and in dreams, and in every kind of wisdom." The omission of the word "four," and the insertion of two words, "understanding" and "knowledge," suggest that the one has somehow taken the place of the other; it may be that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> was read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;</span>. The Massoretic original of the phrase, "skill in all learning," may be rendered literally, "skill in every kind of books." This has a special meaning in regard to the Babylonian and Assyrian books, which were clay tablets incised when wet, and burnt into permanence. Rolls of parchment were, as we see from Jeremiah, the common material for books among the Jews. Among the Egyptians, papyrus largely took the place of parchment, so the knowledge "of every kind of books" meant "every language." It is certain that three languages were to a certain extent in use in Babylon - Aramaic, the ordinary language of business and diplomacy; Assyrian, the court language, the language in which histories and dedications were written; Accadian, the old sacred tongue, in which all the formulae of worship and the forms of incantation had been originally written. From the fact that Rabshakeh could talk Hebrew when conversing with Eliakim and Shebna, it would seem that the accomplish-merit required from a diplomat implied the knowledge of the languages of the various nations subject to the Babylonian Empire or eonterminous with it. "Knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom" would seem to mean the complete eurriculum fitted to make these youths able diplomatists and wise councillors. <span class="accented">And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span> All the nations of antiquity laid stress on  dreams as means by which the future was revealed to men; but in no nation was there so elaborate a system of interpretation as among the Babyhmians. Lenormant ('La Divination') gives a long account, with many passages translated from their books, of their mode of interpreting dreams. "Visions" may be regarded as appearances of the nature of the alleged second sight among the Scottish Highlanders. It may, however, refer to appearances which are regarded as omens of good or evil fortune. We see in all the elaborate distinctions of omens preserved to us in Lenormant only the folly of superstition; but we may not assume that Daniel and his friends did not believe in them. It has been objected that if Daniel and his friends were so scrupulous in regard to the dainties and. the wines of the Babylonian monarch, because these were connected with idol-worship, they ought logically to have refused to learn these superstitious formulae. But men are never completely logical; life is wider than logic, and hence there are always elements that are left out in our calculations. The possession even of Divine inspiration would not suffer men to annul the two millennia and a half that separate us from the days of Daniel. They - Daniel and his friends - did not see in this so-called science of oneiromancy mere superstition. Still less did they recognize it as having a necessary connection with the idolatries of Babylon. In the following chapter we see the theory Daniel himself had of the matter, namely, that God used dreams as means to make known the future to men. No one can say he was mistaken in this. When Luther described heaven to his child, he filled it with what would be most happy for the little boy; he takes the child at the stage at which he is, and tells him the truth, but in limitations suited to his knowledge. May we not reasonably argue that the great Father deals so with his children? When they are in the state of knowledge that makes them expect to have his will revealed to them in dreams and omens, then he will make known his will by dreams. Daniel knew all that Chaldean science could tell him, but he saw that it was limited, that behind all the canons of interpretation there was the Eternal Mind, the Great Thinker, whose thoughts are things. In other words, he did not recognize the so-called science of Babylon, its astrology, its incantations, its omens, its interpretations of dreams as false so much as limited. It has been placed by Jerome as a parallel, that Moses was learned in all the learning of the Egyptians. Jerome assumes "they learned not that they might follow, but that they might judge and convict (<span class="accented">convincant</span>)." We do not see the need of any such supposition. In their own land they in all likelihood believed in the interpretation of dreams, not unlikely in omens too in some degree. When they came to Babylon they came among a people who halt reduced all this to a form that had a delusive appearance of scientific accuracy. They could not fail to believe in all these things. Long after the latest critical date of Daniel, the Jews believed in omens and dreams. Josephus tells us of his own skill in these matters, and is still more explicit in respect to the wisdom of the Essenes in regard to the future. Students of the Talmud will not require to be told of the <span class="accented">bath-qol</span> and other means by which a knowledge of the future was derived. We must, we fear, assume that Daniel was not so far ahead of his contemporaries as not to believe in the science of Babylon, and therefore to expect him to protest against it and refuge to acquire it is absurd in the last degree. This fact of these four Hebrew youths not objecting to heathen learning is n indirect proof of the early date of Daniel. <span class="accented">It</span> this book had been written in the days of the Maccabees, then the learning of the Chaldeans would be a synonym for the learning of the Greeks. We know that, so far from the <span class="accented">Hasideem -</span> the party from whom, by hypothesis, "Daniel" emanated - looking favourably on Greek learning, they hated and abhorred it. We see in the Second Book of Maccabees (4:14) the feelings with which they regarded those who favoured Greek manners; how even the innocent game of <span class="accented">discus</span> was full of horror for them, because it was Greek (1:14); and in the first book with what horror the pious looked on the erection of a gymnasium in Jerusalem. This hatred of everything Greek was very natural, and certainly was very much in evidence in their history. For business purposes they had to know the Greek language; but the learning, the philosophy, and literature of Greece would have been to those engaged in the Maccabean struggle abomination. Is it, then, to be imagined that a writer of the Maccabean period, describing an ancient hero from whose example his contemporaries were to draw encouragement and guidance, would represent him as zealously addicting himself to the pursuit of Gentile learning, and making such progress in it that he excelled all competitors? The attitude ascribed to him would have been more like that of the Rabbi Akiba, who declared that "Greek learning could be studied in an hour that was neither day nor night;" or like that other rabbi, who declared that "the translation of the Scripture into Greek was a disaster to Judaism equal in horror to the  fall of Jerusalem." We hear a great deal of the historic imagination and the necessity of applying it to questions of Biblical criticism. Surely the minds must be strangely deficient in the power of imaginative reconstruction who cannot feel the thrill of abhorrence of everything foreign that must have filled the Jews during the Maccabean struggle. If the critics had only realized this, they would have seen how utterly impossible it is to conceive that a religious novel, written at that time, intended to nerve the Jews for fiercer resistance to their oppressors, should represent the hero complacently acquiring Gentile learning, and acting the submissive courtier in the tyrant's palace. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Holy Heave from the Land. - <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>.

It shall belong to him as land, as a possession in Israel; and my princes shall no more oppress my people, but shall leave the land to the house of Israel according to its tribes. - The domain to be first of all set apart from the land at the time of its distribution among the tribes is called &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, heave, not in the general sense of the lifting or taking of a portion from the whole, but as a portion lifted or taken by a person from his property as an offering for God; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; comes from &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which signifies in the case of the minchah the lifting of a portion which was burned upon the altar as &#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; for Jehovah (see the comm. on <a href="/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>). Consequently everything that was offered by the Israelites, either voluntarily or in consequence of a precept from the Lord for the erection and maintenance of the sanctuary and its servants, was called &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (see <a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>., <a href="/ezekiel/30-15.htm">Ezekiel 30:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>, etc.). Only the principal instructions concerning the heave from the land are given here, and these are repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>, in the section concerning the division of the land, and to some extent expanded there. The introductory words, "when ye divide the land by lot for an inheritance," point to this. (See the map on Plate IV.) &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, sc. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1500; (<a href="/proverbs/1-14.htm">Proverbs 1:14</a>), to cast the lot, to divide by lot, as in <a href="/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>. Then shall ye lift, set apart, a heave for Jehovah as a holy (portion) from the land. &#1502;&#1503;  is to be closely connected with &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, as shown by <a href="/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>. In the numbers mentioned the measure to be employed is not given. But it is obvious that cubits are not meant, as Bttcher, Hitzig, and others assume, but rods; partly from a comparison of <a href="/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>, where the space of the sanctuary, which is given here as 500 by 500 square, is described as five hundred rods on every side; and partly also from the fact that the open space around the sanctuary is fixed at fifty cubits, and in this case &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is added, because rods are not to be understood there as in connection with the other numbers. The correctness of this view, which we meet with in Jerome and Raschi, cannot be overthrown by appealing to the excessive magnitude of a &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth; for it will be seen in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a> that the measurements given answer to the circumstances in rods, but not in cubits. The &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; before and after the number is pleonastic: "as for the length, twenty-five thousand rods in length." Length here is the measurement from east to west, and breadth from north to south, as we may clearly see from <a href="/ezekiel/48-10.htm">Ezekiel 48:10</a>. No regard, therefore, is paid to the natural length and breadth of the land; and the greater extent of the portions to be measured is designated as length, the smaller as breadth. The expression &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1507; is a remarkable one, as &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; is constantly used, not only in <a href="/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>, but also in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-9.htm">Ezekiel 48:9-10</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-13.htm">Ezekiel 48:13</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/48-18.htm">Ezekiel 48:18</a>. The lxx have &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, twenty thousand breadth. This reading appears more correct than the Masoretic, as it is demanded by <a href="/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>. For according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a>, of the portion measured in <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand in breadth were to be measured for the sanctuary and for the priests' land; and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>, the Levites were also to receive twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand in breadth for a possession. The first clause of <a href="/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a> is unintelligible if the breadth of the holy terumah is given in <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> as only ten thousand rods, inasmuch as one cannot measure off from an area of twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth another space of the same length and breadth. Moreover, <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> requires the reading &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, as the "holy terumah" is not only the portion set apart for the sanctuary and the priests' land, but also that which was set apart for the Levites.<p>According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a>, this was also "holy to Jehovah;" whereas the portion measured off for the city was "common" (<a href="/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>). This is borne out by the fact that in the chapter before us the domain appointed for the city is distinguished from the land of the priests and Levites by the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>), whilst the description of the size of the Levites' land in <a href="/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a> is closely connected with that of the land of the priests; and further, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>, in the description of the land of the prince, reference is made only to the holy terumah and the possession of the city, from which it also follows that the land of the Levites is included in the holy terumah. Consequently <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> treats of the whole of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, i.e., the land of the priests and Levites, which was twenty-five thousand rods long and twenty thousand rods broad. This is designated in the last clause of the verse as a holy (portion) in its entire circumference, and then divided into two domains in <a href="/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a>. - <a href="/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>. Of this (&#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, of the area measured in <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>) there shall come, or belong, to the holy, i.e., to the holy temple domain, five hundred rods square, namely, the domain measured in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-15.htm">Ezekiel 42:15-20</a> round about the temple, for a separation between holy and common; and round this domain there is to be a &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, i.e., an open space of fifty cubits on every side, that the dwellings to the priests may not be built too near to the holy square of the temple building. - <a href="/ezekiel/45-3.htm">Ezekiel 45:3</a>. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, this measure (i.e., this measured piece of land), also points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a>, and &#1502;&#1503; cannot be taken in any other sense than in &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>). From the whole tract of land measured in <a href="/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1</a> a portion is to be measured off twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth, in which the sanctuary, i.e., the temple with its courts, is to stand as a holy of holies. This domain, in the midst of which is the temple, is to belong to the priests, as the sanctified portion of the land, as the place or space for their houses, and is to be a sanctuary for the sanctuary, i.e., for the temple. <a href="/ezekiel/45-5.htm">Ezekiel 45:5</a>. A portion equally large is to be measured off to the Levites, as the temple servants, for their possession. The Keri &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is formed after the &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; of <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>, and the Chetib &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is indisputably correct. There is great difficulty in the last words of this verse, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514;, "for a possession to them twenty cells;" for which the lxx give &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, and which they have therefore read, or for which they have substituted by conjecture, &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;. We cannot, in fact, obtain from the &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; of the Masoretic text any meaning that will harmonize with the context, even if we render the words, as Rosenmller does, in opposition to the grammar, cum viginti cubiculis, and understand by &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; capacious cell-buildings. For we neither expect to find in this connection a description of the number and character of the buildings in which the Levites lived, nor can any reason be imagined why the Levites, with a domain of twenty-five thousand rods in length and ten thousand rods in breadth assigned to them, should live together in twenty cell-buildings. Still less can we think of the "twenty cells" as having any connection with the thirty cells in the outer court near to the gate-buildings (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17-18</a>), as these temple cells, even though they were appointed for the Levites during their service in the temple, were not connected in any way with the holy terumah spoken of here. Hvernick's remark, that "the prophet has in his eye the priests' cells in the sanctuary, - and the dwellings of the Levites during their service, which were only on the outside of the sanctuary, were to correspond to these," is not indicated in the slightest degree by the words, but is a mere conjecture. There is no other course open, therefore, than to acknowledge a corruption of the text, and either to alter &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; `srym &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; into &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, as Hitzig proposes (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>), or to take &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as a mistake for &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;: "for a possession to them as gates to dwell in," according to the frequent use of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, gates, for &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, cities, e.g., in what was almost a standing phrase, "the Levites who is in thy gates" ( equals  cities; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; cf. <a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>, etc.). In that case the faulty reading would have arisen from the transposition of &#1506;&#1513; into &#1513;&#1506;, and the change of &#1489; into &#1499;.<p>Beside the holy terumah for sanctuary, priests, and Levites, they are also (<a href="/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>) to give a tract of twenty-five thousand rods in length and five thousand rods in breadth as the property of the city (i.e., of the capital). &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;: parallel to the holy heave, i.e., running by the longer side of it. This portion of land, which was set apart for the city, was to belong to all Israel, and not to any single tribe. The more precise directions concerning this, and concerning the situation of the whole terumah in the land, are not given till <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8-22</a>. Here, in the present chapter, this heave is simply mentioned in connection with the privileges which the servants of the Lord and of His sanctuary were to enjoy. These included, in a certain sense, also the property assigned to the prince in <a href="/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a> as the head of the nation, on whom the provision of the sacrifices for the nation devolved, and who, apart from this, also needed for his subsistence a portion of the land, which should be peculiarly his own, in accordance with his rank. They were to give him as his property (the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is to be supplied to &#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488; from <a href="/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>) the land on this side and that side of the holy terumah and of the city-possession, and that in front (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;) of these two tracts of land, that is to say, adjoining them, extending to their boundaries, '&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1501; , "from" (i.e., according to our view, "upon") the west side westward, and from (upon) the east side eastward; in other words, the land which remained on the eastern and western boundary of the holy terumah and of the city domain, both toward the west as far as the Mediterranean Sea, and toward the east as far as the Jordan, the two boundaries of the future Canaan. The further definition '&#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; is not quite clear; but the meaning of the words is, that "the length of the portions of land to be given to the prince on the east and west side of the terumah shall be equal to the length of one of the tribe-portions," and not that the portions of land belonging to the prince are to be just as long from north to south as the length of one of the twelve tribe-possessions. "Length" throughout this section is the extent from east to west. It is so in the case of all the tribe-territories (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>), and must be taken in this sense in connection with the portion of land belonging to the prince also. The meaning is therefore this: in length (from east to west) these portions shall be parallel to the inheritance of one of the twelve tribes from the western boundary to the eastern. Two things are stated here: first, that the prince's portion is to extend on the eastern and western sides of the terumah as far as the boundary of the land allotted to the tribes, i.e., on the east to the Jordan, and on the west to the Mediterranean (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>); and secondly, that on the east and west it is to run parallel (&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;) to the length of the separate tribe-territories, i.e., not to reach farther toward either north or south than the terumah lying between, but to be bounded by the long sides of the tribe-territories which bound the terumah on the north and south. &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; is the accusative of direction; &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, some one (cf. <a href="/judges/16-7.htm">Judges 16:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/82-7.htm">Psalm 82:7</a>). - In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a>, &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; with the article is to be retained, contrary to Hitzig's conjecture &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;: "to the land belonging to him as a possession shall it (the portion marked off in <a href="/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a>) be to him." &#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a>, of property in land. In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a>, the motive for these instructions is given. The former kings of Israel had no land of their own, no domain; and this had driven them to acquire private property by violence and extortion. That this may not occur any more in the future, and all inducement to such oppression of the people may be taken from the princes, in the new kingdom of God the portion of land more precisely defined in <a href="/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7</a> is to be given to the prince as his own property. The plural, "my princes," does not refer to several contemporaneous princes, nor can it be understood of the king and his sons, i.e., of the royal family, on account of <a href="/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16</a>; but it is to be traced to the simple fact "that Ezekiel was also thinking of the past kings, and that the whole series of princes, who had ruled over Israel, and still would rule, was passing before his mind" (Kliefoth), without our being able to conclude from this that there would be a plurality of princes succeeding one another in time to come, in contradiction to <a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>. -  "And the land shall they (the princes) leave to the people of Israel" (&#1504;&#1514;&#1503; in the sense of concedere; and &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the land, with the exception of the portion set apart from it in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-1.htm">Ezekiel 45:1-7</a>). - The warning against oppression and extortion, implied in the reason thus assigned, is expanded into a general exhortation in the following verses.</body></html>
