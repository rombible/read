Daniel was still firm to his religion. Whatever they called him, he still held fast the spirit of an Israelite. These youths scrupled concerning the meat, lest it should be sinful. When God's people are in Babylon they need take special care that they partake not of her sins. It is much to the praise of young people, not to covet or seek the delights of sense. Those who would excel in wisdom and piety, must learn betimes to keep the body under. Daniel avoided defiling himself with sin; and we should more fear that than any outward trouble. It is easier to keep temptation at a distance, than to resist it when near. And we cannot better improve our interest in any with whom we have found favour, than to use it to keep us from sin. People will not believe the benefit of avoiding excess, and of a spare diet, nor how much they contribute to the health of the body, unless they try. Conscientious temperance will always do more, even for the comfort of this life, than sinful indulgence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel ... - Margin, or, the "steward." It is not easy to determine whether the word here used (&#1502;&#1500;&#1510;&#1512;  meltsa&#770;r) is to be regarded as a proper name, or the name of an office. It occurs nowhere else, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-16.htm">Daniel 1:16</a>, applied to the same person. Gesenius regards it as denoting the name of an office in the Babylonian court - master of the wine, chief butler. Others regard it as meaning a treasurer. The word is still in use in Persia. The Vulgate renders it as a proper name - Malasar; and so the Syriac - Meshitzar; and so the Greek - &#x391;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3b4;  Amelsad. The use of the article in the word (&#1492;&#1502;&#1500;&#1510;&#1512;  hameltsa&#770;r) would seem to imply that it denoted the name of an "office," and nothing would be more probable than that the actual furnishing of the daily portion of food would be entrusted to a steward, or to some incumbent of an office inferior to that sustained by Ashpenaz, <a href="/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The prince of the eunuchs, having put off Daniel with the above answer, seems to have left him; or, however, Daniel, finding he could not obtain of him what he sought for, applies to Melzar, a subordinate officer, whom he hoped to find more pliable; and it may be that Ashpenaz might suggest it to him to apply to this person, and signify that if he could prevail upon him to give him other food instead of the king's; who might be under a temptation from profit, being a meaner officer; he for his part would wink at it, so be it he came not into any danger himself; however, be it as it will, Daniel did apply to this man, whose name was Melzar, for so most take it to be the proper name of a man; which, according to Hillerus (b), signifies one "in full splendour". Josephus calls (c) him Aschanes; though some think it is the name of an office, as a steward, or the like; but whether it is expressive of his name, or his office, he is described as one <p>whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; to give them their food at proper time. <p>(b) Onomast.

What officer is intended is, however, uncertain, as the word has not hitherto been satisfactorily explained. Friedr. Delitzsch thinks that <span class="ital">melẓar</span> may be the Ass. <span class="ital">maẓẓaru</span>, ‘keeper’ (as in <span class="ital">maẓẓar bâbi</span>, ‘keeper of the gate’), the <span class="ital">l</span> taking the place of the doubled <span class="ital">ẓ</span> (cf. <span class="greekheb">βάλσαμον</span> from <span class="ital">bassâm</span>); and Schrader agrees that this explanation is possible. The term evidently denotes some subordinate official, appointed by the chief of the eunuchs to be in personal charge of Daniel and his companions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">11–16</span>. From the answer given by the chief of the eunuchs, Daniel gathers that he does not view his request unfavourably, though he declines the responsibility of acceding to it himself. He therefore applies to the subordinate officer who has the immediate charge of himself and his companions, and induces him to try them temporarily with vegetable diet. The result of the experiment being satisfactory, the royal food is withdrawn from the Jewish youths.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</span> The reading of the Septuagint differs from the Massoretic in two particulars - instead of "Melzar," the name given is "Abiesdri," as in the third verse; and the verb <span class="accented">minnah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">munnoh</span>), "set over." The Peshitta reads instead of "Melzar,' in this verse, "Mashitzar" (but see ver. 16). This confirms the idea that this is a proper name, not an official title. If the assumption of the Septuagint is correct, then the name in the Massoretic text ought to be Hammelzar. This might indicate the name to be Amil-Assur, corresponding <span class="accented">to Amil-Merodach.</span> Theodotion renders the name <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;</span>. While a good deal can be said for making "Melzar" or "Ham-melzar" a proper name, something may also be said for the idea which has gained ground that "Melzar," since it has the article before it, is the name of an official. Lenormant ('La Divination,' p. 196) makes the name <span class="accented">Amil-Ussur.</span> Such, at any rate, is the name of an official in the court of a Ninevite king; it is supposed to mean "steward," but it may be doubted if this is the exact equivalent of such an official as the one here referred to. Hitzig suggests <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and for this rendering there is much to be said. It is an indirect proof of the antiquity of the book, that an official is referred to by a title the exact force of which had been forgotten when the Septuagint translation was produced, not later certainly than the  <span class="date">first century B.C.</span> Theodotion and Jerome are as far at sea as is also the Peshitta. The critical hypothesis is that this Assyrian name for "steward" remained known among the Palestinian Jews from the fall of the Babyloniau Empire in  <span class="date">B.C. 532</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 168</span>, and then in less than a couple of centuries utterly disappeared. The reading of the Septuagint," Abiesdri," may be laid aside; it is a reading that would suggest itself to any one who appreciated the difficulty of the passage. In the previous verse we were made auditors to a conversation between Daniel and Ashpenaz, in which he does not consent to Daniel's request. In the verse before us Daniel addresses another request to a new but subordinate official. As the request is one that might naturally follow the refusal, mild but to all appearance firm, of the prince of the eunuchs, what could be more natural than to imagine that <span class="accented">Amelzar</span> was a misreading for Abiesdri? The story has been condensed. Had we the full narrative, we most likely would have seen that Daniel had to go over the argument with the subordinate that he had already had with the superior. It is not unlikely that the prince of the eunuchs was not expressly informed of the experiment being tried,of which the verse which follows informs us. This would help to save him from the responsibility of the thing; it is not inconceivable that he intentionally kept himself uninformed. Not only has Daniel secured a personal influence over the prince of the eunuchs, but also over this Melzar, or steward. There are people in the world who have this magnetic power over their fellows which compels their liking. When with this are united abilities of a man to do exploits and leave his mark on the world, we have a national hero. Napoleon the Great was eminently a man of this kind. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/44.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Requisites for the Administration of the Priests' Office, and the Obligations and Privileges of that Office. - <a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a>.

The dress prescribed in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> for the priests to wear during the holy service had this signification. The same rule is here presupposed as still in force; and it is simply renewed and partially emphasized by the enumeration of some of the leading points. At the service at the altar and in the holy place the priests are to wear linen clothes, and, after the performance of the service, they are to take them off again when they go into the outer court (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17-19</a>). In the Mosaic law, &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;, white byssus, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;, white linen, is mentioned as the material used for the priests' clothing (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42</a>); here the material is more distinctly designated as &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, flax linen; and &#1510;&#1502;&#1512;, animal wool, is expressly forbidden, the motive being assigned for this regulation, namely, that the priest is not to cause himself to sweat by wearing woollen clothing. Sweat produces uncleanness; and the priest, by keeping his body clean, is to show even outwardly that he is clean and blameless. With regard to the putting on and off of the official clothes, the new thorah accords with the Mosaic. For we cannot agree with Kliefoth, who detects a deviation in the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>, the priests were to wear the official clothes only when they entered the tabernacle and when approaching the altar, and, according to <a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>, were to take them off when the service was ended; whereas, according to <a href="/ezekiel/44-17.htm">Ezekiel 44:17</a> of the chapter before us, they were to put them on as soon as they entered the inner court, and were never to come before the people in the official costume. If, according to the Mosaic law, the priests were to go before the altar of burnt-offering in the court in their holy official dress, and not otherwise, they must have put on this dress on entering the court; for they could not wait till they were in front of the altar before they changed their clothes. For the expression &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; does not imply that, according to Ezekiel, they were never to appear in the presence of the people in their official costume, as it does not mean "come before the people," but "go out to the people," or "walk among the people;" nor is this involved in the words '&#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; , they shall not sanctify the people in their clothes (by their clothes). The latter by no means affirms that they are to sanctify the people by intercourse with them, but are not to do this in official costume; the meaning is simply that they are not to move among the people in the outer court while wearing their official clothes, that they may not sanctify them by their holy clothes.<p>This sanctification cannot be understood in any other way than as analogous to the rule laid down in the law, that touching most holy sacrificial flesh would sanctify (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-20.htm">Leviticus 6:20</a>), which Ezekiel repeats in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>, and which does not stand in anything like an isolated position in the law, but is also affirmed in <a href="/exodus/29-37.htm">Exodus 29:37</a> and <a href="/exodus/30-29.htm">Exodus 30:29</a> of the altar of burnt-offering and the vessels of the sanctuary. The same thing which applied to these vessels - namely, that their holiness passed from them to any one who touched them - is here predicated of the holy dresses of the priests; and the moving of the priests among the people in their holy clothes is forbidden, because such holiness, acquired by contact with holy objects, imposed upon the person to whom it had passed the obligation to guard against all defilement (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-8</a>), which the people could not avoid in the ordinary relations of life, and thus a weakening or abolition of the distinction between things holy and common would inevitably have ensued. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; are the holy cell-buildings described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a>. - To the clothing there is simply appended in <a href="/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a> the direction concerning the hair of the head, the natural covering of the head, in relation to which excess on either side is prohibited, either shaving the head bald or wearing the hair uncut. Both of these were forbidden to the priests in the law: shaving in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>, and letting the hair grow freely in <a href="/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; and the latter was simply imposed upon the Nazarites for the period of their vow (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1501; only occurs here; but its meaning, to cut the hair, is obvious from the context. - <a href="/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>. The prohibition of the drinking of wine when performing service agrees with <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>; on the other hand, the instructions concerning the choice of wives are sharpened in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-22.htm">Ezekiel 44:22</a>, as that which only applied to the high priest in the law is here extended to all the priests. In fact, Ezekiel throughout makes no distinction between the high priest and the common priests. In <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-14.htm">Leviticus 21:14</a>, marrying a widow is only forbidden to the high priest, who was to marry a virgin of his own people, whereas no such restriction is laid down for the ordinary priests. Here, on the other hand, marrying a widow is forbidden to all the priests, marriage with the widow of a priest being the only one allowed. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; belongs to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, who has become the widow of a priest.<p>(Note: The Rabbins (Targ. Talm. and Masor. according to their accentuation) have endeavoured to obliterate this distinction, by applying the first hemistich to the high priest alone, and explaining the second thus: "The widow, who is really a widow, the priest may take," interpreting &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; by quidam sacerdotum, or aliqui ex ordine sacerdotali, or ceteri sacerdotes. But this is contrary to the usage of the language, as &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1503; cannot possibly be understood in a partitive sense in this passage, where the priests generally are spoken of, and the plural &#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; follows.)<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-24.htm">Ezekiel 44:24</a> the general official duties of the priests are mentioned, viz., to teach the people, and to instruct them concerning the difference between the holy and the unholy, the clean and the unclean, as in <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>); also to administer justice in questions in dispute according to the rights of God-a duty which had already been committed to the priests in its highest form in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;, concerning, in the case of, matters in dispute. &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; , to stand to judge, i.e., to appear or act as judge (compare &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, to appoint or institute judges, in <a href="/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5</a>). The Keri &#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is a needless emendation after <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>. The Chetib &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, on the other hand, is a copyist's error for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;. Lastly, at all the feasts they are to observe the laws and statutes of Jehovah, that is to say, to perform all the priestly duties binding upon them at the feasts, and to sanctify the Sabbaths, not merely by offering the Sabbath sacrifices, but also by maintaining the Sabbath rest (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>). - In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25-27</a> there follow regulations concerning defilement from the dead, and its removal. <a href="/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25</a> is a simple repetition of <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>. But the instructions concerning the purification from defilement from the dead are sharpened, inasmuch as not only is the purification prescribed by the law (<a href="/numbers/19-1.htm">Numbers 19:1</a>.), and which lasted seven days, required (this is meant by &#1496;&#1492;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;), but a further period of seven days is appointed after these, at the expiration of which the presentation of a sin-offering is demanded before the service in the sanctuary can be resumed. By this demand for a heightened purification, the approach to a corpse permitted to the priests, which was prohibited to the high priest in the Mosaic law, even in the case of father and mother (<a href="/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a>), is tolerably equalized.<p>For these duties and obligations of service the priests are to receive corresponding emoluments. These are treated of in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28-31</a>. They are not, indeed, to receive any share of the land as their property in time to come any more than in former times; but in the place of this Jehovah will be their property and possession, and give them the necessary room for their dwellings from His own property in the land (<a href="/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>), and let them draw their maintenance from His altar (<a href="/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>). The promise that Jehovah will be the &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; of the priests is a simple repetition of the regulation in the law (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>). So far as the construction in <a href="/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> is concerned, the words &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; are really the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; &#1500;&#1503;, which we are obliged to render obliquely, "the inheritance for them shall be, I am their inheritance." For the proposal of Hitzig to take the words from &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1501; to the close of the verse as a parenthesis, and to regard '&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; in <a href="/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> as the subject to '&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, is untenable, not only on account of the great harshness which such a parenthesis would involve, but principally because these portions of the sacrifices and heave-offerings which belonged to the priest were not a &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and are never designated as &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, inheritance, i.e., property in land. <a href="/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a> treats of the property in land, which God assigned to the Levites and priests under the Mosaic economy, by appointing them towns to dwell in, with meadows for the feeding of their cattle, within the territory of the other tribes, but would assign to them in future from the heave-offering set apart from the land for the sanctuary (<a href="/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a>). It is not till <a href="/ezekiel/44-29.htm">Ezekiel 44:29</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a> that the means of support for the priests are spoken of. They are to be supported from the sacrifices and the tithes and first-fruits which Israel has to pay to Jehovah as the lord of the land, and which He transfers to His servants the priests. For the priests' share of the meat-offering, sin-offering, and trespass-offering, see <a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6-7</a>; for that which is put under the ban, <a href="/leviticus/27-21.htm">Leviticus 27:21</a>; for the first-fruits, <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-26.htm">Exodus 34:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; for the &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; for the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-20.htm">Numbers 15:20-21</a>. In '&#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495;, "to cause a blessing to rest upon thy house," the individual Israelite is addressed. For the fact itself, see <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>. - To the enumeration of the means of support there is appended in <a href="/ezekiel/44-31.htm">Ezekiel 44:31</a> an emphatic repetition of the command in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-8.htm">Leviticus 22:8</a>, not to eat of any dead thing (i.e., anything that has died a natural death), or anything torn to pieces, either of birds or beasts, on account of its defiling (<a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>). </body></html>
