The phrase does not mean that “he prophesied,” but that he lived until the time specified; by no means implying that he died in the first year of Cyrus. This year is specified on account of its importance to the Jewish people as the year of their deliverance.

And it is well for a country, and for the honour of a prince, when he is able to judge who are best fitted to serve him, and prefers them on that account.

That is, he continued in influence and authority at different times during that period, and, of course, during the whole of the seventy years captivity. It is not necessarily implied that he did not "live" longer, or even that he ceased then to have influence and authority at court, but the object of the writer is to show that, during that long and eventful period, he occupied a station of influence until the captivity was accomplished, and the royal order was issued for rebuilding the temple. He was among the first of the captives that were taken to Babylon, and he lived to see the end of the captivity - "the joyful day of Jewish freedom." - Prof. Stuart. It is commonly believed that, when the captives returned, he remained in Chaldea, probably detained by his high employments in the Persian empire, and that he died either at Babylon or at Shushan. Compare the Introduction Section I.<p>Practical Remarks<p>In view of the exposition given of this chapter, the following remarks may be made:<p>(1) There is in every period of the world, and in every place, much obscure and buried talent that might be cultivated and brought to light, as there are many gems in earth and ocean that are yet undiscovered. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1-4</a>. Among these captive youths - prisoners of war - in a foreign land, and as yet unknown, there was most rich and varied talent - talent that was destined yet to shine at the court of the most magnificent monarchy of the ancient world, and to be honored as among the brightest that the world has seen. And so in all places and at all times, there is much rich and varied genius which might shine with great brilliancy, and perform important public services, if it were cultivated and allowed to develope itself on the great theater of human affairs. Thus, in obscure rural retreats there may be bright gems of intellect; in the low haunts of vice there may be talent that would charm the world by the beauty of song or the power of eloquence; among slaves there may be mind which, if emancipated, would take its place in the brightest constellations of genius. The great endowments of Moses as a lawgiver, a prophet, a profound statesman, sprang from an enslaved people, as those of Daniel did; and it is not too much to say that the brightest talent of the earth has been found in places of great obscurity, and where, but for some remarkable dispensation of Providence, it might have remained forever unknown. This thought has been immortalized by Gray:<p>"Full many a gem of purest ray serene,<p>The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;<p>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<p>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.<p>"Some village Hampden, that with dauntless breast<p>The little tyrant of his fields withstood;<p>Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest.<p>Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood."<p>There is at any time on the earth talent enough created for all that there is to be done in any generation; and there is always enough for talent to accomplish if it were employed in the purposes for which it was originally adapted. There need be at no time any wasted or unoccupied mind; and there need be no great and good plan that should fail for the want of talent fitted to accomplish it, if what actually exists on the earth were called into action.<p>(2) He does a great service to the world who seeks out such talent, and gives it an opportunity to accomplish what it is fitted to, by furnishing it the means of an education, <a href="/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a>. Nebuchadnezzar, unconsciously, and doubtless undesignedly, did a great service to mankind by his purpose to seek out the talent of the Hebrew captives, and giving it an opportunity to expand and to ripen into usefulness. Daniel has taken his place among the prophets and statesmen of the world as a man of rare endowments, and of equally rare integrity of character. He has, under the leading of the Divine Spirit, done more than most other prophets to lift the mysterious veil which shrouds the future; more than "could" have been done by the penetrating sagacity of all the Burkes, the Cannings, and the Metternichs of the world. So far as human appearances go, all this might have remained in obscurity, if it had not been for the purpose of the Chaldean monarch to bring forward into public notice the obscure talent which lay hid among the Hebrew captives. He always does a good service to mankind who seeks out bright and promising genius, and who gives it the opportunity of developing itself with advantage on the great theater of human affairs.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Daniel continued &#8230; unto &#8230; first year of Cyrus&#8212;(2Ch 36:22; Ezr 1:1). Not that he did not continue beyond that year, but the expression is designed to mark the fact that he who was one of the first captives taken to Babylon, lived to see the end of the captivity. See my [1081]Introduction, "Significance of the Babylonian Captivity." In Da 10:1 he is mentioned as living "in the third year of Cyrus." See Margin Note, on the use of "till" (Ps 110:1, 112:8).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. In the court of Babylon until Cyrus, and then he was in the Persian court, and he lived in honour and high employment all that time, yea, after Cyrus began to reign; for, <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/10-1.htm" title="In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.">Daniel 10:1</a></span>, he had visions and revelations in the third year of Cyrus.

In Babylon, and at court there, and in the favour of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors: <p>even unto the first year of King Cyrus: by whom Babylon was taken, and when the seventy years' captivity of the Jews were at an end; which time Daniel was there, for the sake of observing which this is mentioned: not that Daniel died in the first year of Cyrus; or went from Babylon with the rest of the Jews to Jerusalem upon the proclamation of Cyrus, as Jacchiades thinks; for we hear of him at the river Hiddekel, in the third year of Cyrus, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-1.htm">Daniel 10:1</a>, but he was till this time in the court of the kings of Babylon; and afterwards in the courts of the kings of Media and Persia; for when it is said he was there, it does not so much intend his being there as the state and condition in which he was there; namely, as a favourite and prime minister; for he is said to prosper in the reign of Darius and Cyrus, <a href="/daniel/6-28.htm">Daniel 6:28</a>. This is that Cyrus who was prophesied of by name, near two hundred years before he was born, by the Prophet Isaiah, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, which were sure prophecies, and to be depended upon; and had their exact accomplishment in him. Heathen writers report many things, as presages and predictions of his future greatness; they tell us some dreams, which his grandfather Astyages had concerning his daughter Mandane, the mother of Cyrus; which the interpreters of dreams in those days explained of a future son of hers, that was to be lord of all Asia (h): and Megasthenes (i) relates a prophecy of Nebuchadnezzar, who before his death foretold to the Babylonians that a calamity should befall them, which neither his progenitor Belus nor Queen Beltis could avert; which was, that a Persian mule should bring them under subjection, assisted by a Mede; which is understood of Cyrus, who was a Medo Persian; his father was Cambyses king of Persia, and his mother Mandane was daughter of Astyages king of Media; and he, with Darius the Mede, or however with his army, conquered Babylon: and he is also supposed to be the mule in the Pythian oracle that should be king of the Medes; by which Croesus was deceived, who concluded a mule would never be a king; and therefore, as his kingdom was safe till there was such an one, it must be for ever so (k). The birth, parentage, and education of this prince, together with his victories, and particularly his taking of Babylon, are recorded by Xenophon in his history, in great agreement with this book of Daniel. Plutarch says (l) that Cyrus, or Coresh, as his name is in Hebrew, in the Persian tongue signifies the sun; and the name of the sun, Cheres, is pretty near in sound to it in the Hebrew tongue; and of the same signification and derivation with Cyrus, or Coresh, seems to be Carshena, one of the seven princes of Persia. Cyrus is remarkably famous for the edict he published in favour of the Jews, giving them liberty to go to their own land, and rebuild their temple, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>, according to Cicero (m), out of Dionysius the Persian, he lived to be seventy years of age; and died after a reign of seven years, according to Xenophon (n); and of nine years, according to Ptolemy's canon; the one reckoning from the time he became sole monarch of the empire; the other from his reigning in partnership with his uncle Cyaxares, or Darius the Mede. <p>(h) Herodoti Clio, sive l. 1. c. 107, 108.

In other parts of the Old Testament (e.g. in Jeremiah, <span class="ital">passim</span>) it has an <span class="ital">ethnic</span> sense: it denotes a people which (in the inscriptions at present known) is thought to be first alluded to about 1100 b.c., and is certainly named repeatedly from 880 b.c.: they lived then in the S.E. of Babylonia, towards the sea-coast; afterwards, as they increased in power, they gradually advanced inland; in 721 b.c. Merodach-baladan, ‘king of the land of the <span class="ital">Kaldu</span>,’ made himself king of Babylon; and ultimately, under Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar, they became the ruling caste in Babylonia. In the Book of Daniel (except in <a href="/daniel/5-30.htm" title="In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.">Daniel 5:30</a>, <a href="/daniel/9-1.htm" title="In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;">Daniel 9:1</a>, where the term plainly has its ethnic sense), ‘Chaldaean’ is the designation not of the ruling caste at large, but of the class—or one of the classes—of <span class="ital">wise men</span> (<a href="/daniel/1-4.htm" title="Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.">Daniel 1:4</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm" title="Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams.

And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.">Daniel 5:7</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-11.htm" title="There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;">Daniel 5:11</a>). Of this sense of the word there is no trace in the inscriptions; it is first found in Herodotus (<span class="ital">c.</span> 440 b.c.), and is common afterwards in the classical writers; and it dates really from a time when ‘Chaldaean’ had become synonymous with ‘Babylonian’ in general, and when virtually the only ‘Chaldaeans’ known were members of the priestly or learned class. The following passages will shew how the classical writers understood the term.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hdt. i. 181 (in the description of the ‘ziggurat’ of Bel, i.e. [Tiele] Merodach, in Babylon): ‘as the <span class="ital">Chaldaeans</span>, being priests of this god, say.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>i. 183: ‘On the greater altar [in the precincts of the temple at the foot of the ‘ziggurat’] the <span class="ital">Chaldaeans</span> burn also 1000 talents of frankincense every year, when they celebrate the festival pf this god.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Also, in the same chapter, ‘as the <span class="ital">Chaldaeans</span> said,’ and ‘I did not see it, but I say what is said by the <span class="ital">Chaldaeans</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Strabo (1 cent. b.c.) xvi. 1 § 6: ‘There is also a quarter reserved in Babylon for the native philosophers called “Chaldaeans,” who pursue principally the study of astronomy. Some claim also to cast nativities; but these are not recognized by the others. There is moreover a tribe of the Chaldaeans, and a district of Babylonia, inhabited by them, near the Arabian and the Persian Gulf[189]. There are also several classes (<span class="greekheb">γένη</span>) of the astronomical Chaldaeans, some being called Orcheni [i.e. belonging to Orchoe, or Uruk], others Borsippans, and others having other names according to the different doctrines held by their various schools.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[189] This sentence (cf. § 8 and 3 § 6) is interesting, as it shews that ‘Chaldaeans,’ in the original ethnic sense of the name, were still resident in their ancient homes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Diodorus Siculus (1 cent. b.c.) describes them at greater length. The ‘Chaldaeans,’ he says (<a href="/daniel/2-29.htm" title="As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind on your bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass.">Daniel 2:29</a>), ‘form a caste, possessing a fixed traditional lore, in which successive generations are brought up, and which they transmit unchanged to their successors. They are among the most ancient of the Babylonians, and hold in the state a position similar to that of the priests in Egypt. Appointed primarily to attend to the worship of the gods, they devote their lives to philosophy, enjoying especially a reputation for astrology. They are also much occupied with divination (<span class="greekheb">μαντική</span>), uttering predictions about the future; and by means partly of purifications, partly of sacrifices, and partly of incantations (<span class="greekheb">ἐπῳδαί</span>), endeavour to avert evil [cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm" title="But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come on you in their perfection for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great abundance of your enchantments.">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/47-11.htm" title="Therefore shall evil come on you; you shall not know from where it rises: and mischief shall fall on you; you shall not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come on you suddenly, which you shall not know....">Isaiah 47:11-13</a>] and to complete happiness. They are moreover experienced in divination by means of birds, and interpret dreams and omens (<span class="greekheb">τέρατα</span>); they are also practised in the inspection of sacrificial animals (<span class="greekheb">ἱεροσκοπία</span>), and have a character for divining accurately by their means.’ And he proceeds (<span class="ital">cc</span>. 30, 31) to give some account of the astronomical doctrines of the ‘Chaldaeans,’ and to speak of their remarkable skill in predicting the destinies of men from observation of the planets[190].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[190] Cf. also Cic. <span class="ital">Divin</span>. i. i., xli., ii. xli–xliii., xlvii.; <span class="ital">Tusc</span>. i. xl.; <span class="ital">de Fato</span> viii.

Except in what concerns the name ‘Chaldaeans,’ the statements of Diodorus, as far as they go, are correct, and substantiated by what is now known from the inscriptions. Here is what is said in the most recent and best work upon the subject[191]:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[191] Jastrow’s <span class="ital">Religion of Babylonia and Assyria</span> (Boston, U.S.A. 1898), p. 656 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The general name for priests was <span class="ital">shangû</span>, which by a plausible etymology suggested by Jensen, indicates the function of the priest as the one who presides over the sacrifices. But this function represents only one phase of the priestly office in Babylonia, and not the most important one, by any means. For the people, the priest was primarily the one who could drive evil demons out of the body of the person smitten with disease, who could thwart the power of wizards and witches, who could ward off the attacks of mischievous spirits, or who could prognosticate the future and determine the intention or will of the gods. The offering of sacrifices was one of the means to accomplish this end, but it is significant that many of the names used to designate the priestly classes have reference to the priest’s position as the exorciser of evil spirits, or his power to secure a divine oracle or to foretell the future, and not to his function as sacrificer. Such names are <span class="ital">mashmashu</span>, the general term for ‘the charmer’; <span class="ital">kalû</span>, so called, perhaps, as the ‘restrainer’ of the demons, the one who keeps them in check; <span class="ital">lagaru</span>, a synonym of <span class="ital">kalû; makhkhû</span>[192], ‘soothsayer’; <span class="ital">surrû</span>, a term which is still obscure; <span class="ital">shâilu</span>, the ‘inquirer,’ who obtains an oracle through the dead or through the gods[193]; <span class="ital">mushêlu</span>[194], ‘necromancer’; <span class="ital">âshipu</span>[195] or <span class="ital">ishippu</span>, ‘sorcerer’.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[192] Whence, probably, the ‘Rab-<span class="ital">mag</span>,’ i.e. ‘chief of the soothsayers,’ of <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[193] Cf. the Heb. <span class="greekheb">שׁאל</span> in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm" title="Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>; <a href="/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Jdg 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm" title="Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines?

Demons, or evil spirits, were supposed to be active upon earth, bringing to mankind diseases, misfortunes, and every kind of ill; the heavens were supposed to exercise an influence over the destinies of men and nations; all kinds of natural occurrences which we should describe as accidental, such as an animal entering a building, were supposed to be declarations of the will of the gods; and methods had to be devised for the purpose of dealing with the occult agencies concerned, of interpreting all significant phenomena, and of averting, where this was held to be possible, the evils which they portended. The demons were ever present and ever active: so sorcerers and sorceresses sprang up, who, by means of various magical devices, could invoke the demons at their will, and bring such persons as they chose within their power. On the other hand, the priests were ready with means for protecting people who were thus assailed; and many collections of ‘incantations’ have come down to us, each dealing with some particular kind of demonic evil, or providing some particular method of protection against demons. In particular, every kind of disease was attributed to the action of some malignant spirit, either attacking a person spontaneously, or induced to do so by bewitchment; and the cure was effected by exorcising the demon through prescribed formulae of supposed power, accompanied by symbolical acts (e.g. burning the image of the witch)[197]. Omens were also carefully observed, and tables were drawn up describing the significance of all kinds of occurrences, including the most trifling, in heaven and earth. “Fully one-fourth of the portion of Asshurbanabal’s library that has been discovered consists of omen-tablets of various sizes in which explanations are afforded of all physical peculiarities to be observed in animals and men, of natural phenomena, of the positions and movements of the planets and stars, of the incidents and accidents of public and private life—in short, of all possible occurrences and situations[198].”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[197] Jastrow, pp. 253–293.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[198] Jastrow, pp. 352–406.

Minuter details would here be out of place, as they would not really illustrate anything in the Book of Daniel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The principles upon which the explanations of all these phenomena were drawn up were, no doubt, partly the association of ideas (as when the sight of a lion symbolized strength, or success), and partly the extension of a single coincidence between a given phenomenon and a particular subsequent occurrence, into a general law. It is, however, evident to what long and elaborate treatises the systematization of rules for dealing with, and explaining, such an immense variety of phenomena would ultimately lead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are six terms used in the Book of Daniel as designations of diviners or magicians, viz.

In Diodorus Siculus ‘Chaldaeans’ is the generic term; but in Daniel that, except once, appears as the name of one class beside others: in <a href="/daniel/1-4.htm" title="Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.">Daniel 1:4</a>, however (unless, which is improbable, there was no special ‘literature’ connected with any of the other classes), it is used in a generic sense. In <a href="/daniel/4-7.htm" title="Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof.">Daniel 4:7</a> and <a href="/daniel/5-11.htm" title="There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;">Daniel 5:11</a> ‘determiners (of fates)’ appears to take the place of ‘sorcerers’ in <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm" title="Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.">Daniel 2:2</a>, although the two terms do not seem to be by any means synonymous. Nor are the several classes of wise men named in Daniel known to correspond to any division or classification indicated by the inscriptions. The attempts which have been made to prove the contrary cannot be pronounced successful. Lenormant, for example[199], observing that the great work on magic preserved in Asshurbanabal’s library consists of three parts, dealing respectively with incantations against evil spirits, incantations against diseases, and magical hymns, argued that these three divisions corresponded exactly to the three classes, <span class="ital">ḥarṭummim</span> or ‘conjurateurs,’ <span class="ital">wise men</span> or ‘médecins,’ and <span class="ital">’ashshâphim</span> or ‘théosophes,’ mentioned in Daniel by the side of the astrologers and diviners (<span class="ital">kasdim</span> and <span class="ital">gâzerin</span>): but the parallel drawn is an arbitrary one; there is no reason whatever for supposing that ‘wise men’ in Heb. or Aramaic denoted ‘médecins,’ or <span class="ital">’ashshâphim</span> ‘théosophes.’ It seems evident that the author simply took such terms denoting diviners or magicians, as were traditionally connected with Babylon, or seemed to him on other grounds to be suitable, and combined them together, for the purpose of presenting a general picture of the manner in which the arts of divination and magic were systematically studied in Babylon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[199] <span class="ital">La Magie</span>, p. 13 f.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of King Cyrus.</span> The Septuagint supplies <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic. It has been objected by Canon Driver that the natural classical order of the latter two words should have been <span class="accented">hammelek Koresh</span>, not, as it is in the Massoretic, <span class="accented">Koresh hammelek.</span> The Septuagint text seems to have had <span class="accented">parseem</span>, which would make the order perfectly classical. A greater difficulty is to explain how it is said that Daniel "continued," or, if we take the Hebrew literally "was," until the <span class="accented">first</span> year of "Cyrus the king," when in the tenth chapter the third year of Cyrus is referred to. There are several ways of getting over this difficulty. The first way is to suppose that some words have dropped out of the text. There are, however, different ideas as to the words so lost. Thus Bleak would supply "in high respect in Babylon." Earlier commentators would supply "in Babylon," thinking that not impossibly he returned to Palestine. Jerome  - one of these - does not, however, intrude his suggestion into the text, as does Ewald. His suggestion is that the omitted words are "in the king's court," which is much the same as Delitzsch's "at the court." Hitzig is credited by Kranichfeld with asserting that the author did not intend to make his hero live beyond the year he refers to - the first year of Cyrus. In his commentary, however, Hitzig suggests that <span class="accented">b"</span><span class="accented">sha'ar hammelek</span>, "in the gate of the king," has dropped out. He does certainly hint that the sentence, to be complete, would need <span class="accented">hayah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), not <span class="accented">hayah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). Zockler would supply the same word. There is certainly this to be said for the above theory - that the sentence as it stands is incomplete. The verb <span class="accented">hayah</span> is never used instead of h<span class="accented">ayah.</span> At the same time, there is no trace in any of the versions of any difficulty in regard to the text. Another method of meeting the difficulty is that adopted by Hengstenberg, followed by Havernick, but suggested in the eleventh century by Jephet-ibn-Ali. It is this - that as the first year of Cyrus was the year when he allowed the Jews to return to their own laud, that the attainment of this <span class="accented">annus mirabilis</span> was an element in his wonderful prosperity, that he who had mourned for the sins of his people, who had been one of the earliest to feel the woes of captivity, should live to see the curse removed, and Judah permitted to return to their city and temple. The objection to this view, urged by Professor Bevan, is that the author elsewhere "never alludes to the event save indirectly (<a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>)." To this it may be answered that the whole ninth chapter goes on the assumption that the seventy years are now all but over, and therefore that the return cannot be long delayed. We regard this silence of Daniel in respect to the return from Babylon as one of the strongest evidences of the authenticity of the book. Everybody knows how largely it bulks in preceding prophecy, and how important it is in after-days. No one writing a religious romance could have failed to have laid great prominence on this event, and introduced Daniel as inducing Cyrus to issue the decree. On the contrary, he does not even mention it. Tide is precisely the conduct that would be followed by a contemporary at the present time. In religious biographies of the past generation that involve the year 1832, when the Reform Act was passed - the greatest political change of this century - we find that most of them never once refer to it. If any one should take Cowper's 'Letters,' written during the American War, he will find comparatively few references to the whole matter, although from, at all events, 1780 to 1783, we have letters for nearly every week, and they occupy nearly three hundred pages. Now, if a person were condensing these and selecting passages from them, he might easily make such a selection as would contain not a single reference to that war or to any political event whatever. Yet Cowper was interested in the struggle that was going on. The main objection to Hengstenberg's view is the grammatical one that it implies that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span>, and there is no trace in the versions of this various reading The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>; Theodotion has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>; the Peshitta has  (<span class="accented">hu</span>); Jerome has <span class="accented">fuit.</span> It is somewhat difficult to come to any conclusion, but there are certain things we must bear in mind. In the first place, an author does not usually contradict his statements elsewhere directly. He may implicitly do so, but not when direct dates are given. If he should fail to put the matter right, some other will be sure to do so, if his work attains sufficient popularity to be commented upon. We may thus be sure that there is some solution of the apparent contradiction between the verse before us and ch. 10. In the next place, we must note that this verse is the work of the editor, probably also the translator and condenser, of this earlier part of Daniel.  Therefore the difference may be found quite explicable could we go back to the Aramaic original. If '<span class="accented">ad</span> represented '<span class="accented">ad di</span> (<a href="/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>) in the Aramaic, and the two latter clauses were transposed, we should translate, "And Daniel was for Cyrus the king even before his first year." The connection is somewhat violent; but if we regard the redactor as thinking of the success of Daniel, this might be a thought which suggested itself to his mind - he was with Nebuchadnezzar, and he was with Cyrus. The difficulty of the date is not of importance. That might be got over in several ways. Either by adopting in <a href="/daniel/10-1.htm">Daniel 10:1</a> the reading of the Septuagint, which is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> - the only objection to this is that it is a correction that might easily be made by a would-be harmonist; but, on the other hand, the "third" year of Belshazzar being mentioned in the eighth chapter may have occasioned the insertion of "third" in the tenth. Or, since we know that, though in his proclamation Cyrus styles himself "King of Babil," yet in some of the contract tables of the flint two years of his reign he is not called "King of Babil," but only "king of nations," and there are contract tables of those years that are even dated by the years of Nabunahid, is it not, then, possible that the third year of Cyrus as "king of nations" might coincide with the first year of his reign as "King of Babil"? Yet further, we must remember that the reign of Cyrus could be reckoned from several different starting-points. He first appears as King of Ansan, then he becomes King of the Persians, and as such he conquers Babylon. His first year as King of Babylon may have been his third year as King of Persia. Thus it would be equally true to say that the Emperor William I. of Germany died in the seventeenth and in the twenty-eighth year of his reign - the one statement reckoning his reign as emperor, the other as king. No solution seems absolutely satisfactory. The difficulty presses equally on the critics and those who maintain the traditional opinion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>General Exhortation to Observe Justice and Righteousness in their Dealings. - <a href="/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9</a>.

These acts of violence pressed heavily upon the people, and this burden is to be removed (&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;). In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-10.htm">Ezekiel 45:10-12</a> the command to practise justice and righteousness is expanded; and it is laid as a duty upon the whole nation to have just weights and measures. This forms the transition to the regulation, which follows from <a href="/ezekiel/45-13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a> onwards, of the taxes to be paid by the people to the prince to defray the expenses attendant upon the sacrificial worship. - For <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-10.htm">Ezekiel 45:10</a>, see <a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>. Instead of the hin (<a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>), the bath, which contained six hins, is mentioned here as the measure for liquids. The &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; is met with for the first time in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/5-10.htm">Isaiah 5:10</a>, and appears to have been introduced as a measure for liquids after the time of Moses, having the same capacity as the ephah for dry goods (see my Bibl. Archol. II pp. 139ff.). This similarity is expressly stated in <a href="/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>. Both of them, the ephah as well as the bath, are to contain the tenth of a homer (&#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, to carry, for &#1500;&#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500;, to contain, to hold; compare <a href="/genesis/36-7.htm">Genesis 36:7</a> with <a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>), and to be regulated by the homer. <a href="/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a> treats of the weights used for money. The first clause repeats the old legal provision (<a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>), that the shekel, as the standard weight for money, which was afterwards stamped as a coin, is to contain twenty gerahs. The regulations which follow are very obscure: "twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, fifteen shekels, shall the mina be to you." The mina, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, occurs only here and in <a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-71.htm">Nehemiah 7:71-72</a>, - that is to say, only in books written during the captivity of subsequent to it. If we compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>, according to which three minas of gold were used for a shield, with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a>, where three hundred (shekels) of gold are said to have been used for a similar shield, it is evident that a mina was equal to a hundred shekels. Now as the talent (&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;) contained three thousand (sacred or Mosaic) shekels (see the comm. on <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25-26</a>), the talent would only have contained thirty minas, which does not seem to answer to the Grecian system of weights. For the Attic talent contained sixty minas, and the mina a hundred drachms; so that the talent contained six thousand drachms, or three thousand didrachms. But as the Hebrew shekel was equal to a &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the Attic talent with three thousand didrachms corresponded to the Hebrew talent with three thousand shekels; and the mina, as the sixtieth part of the talent, with a hundred drachms or fifty didrachms, ought to correspond to the Hebrew mina with fifty shekels, as the Greek name &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834;  is unquestionably derived from the Semitic &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;. The relation between the mina and the shekel, resulting from a comparison of <a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a>, can hardly be made to square with this, by the assumption that the shekels referred to in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a> are not Mosaic shekels, but so-called civil shekels, the Mosaic half-shekel, the beka, &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;, having acquired the name of shekel in the course of time, as the most widely-spread silver coin of the larger size. A hundred such shekels or bekas made only fifty Mosaic shekels, which amounted to one mina; while sixty minas also formed one talent (see my Bibl. Archol. II pp. 135, 136).<p>But the words of the second half of the verse before us cannot be brought into harmony with this proportion, take them how we will. If, for example, we add the three numbers together, 20 + 25 + 15 shekels shall the mina be to you, Ezekiel would fix the mina at sixty shekels. But no reason whatever can be found for such an alteration of the proportion between the mina and the talent on the one hand, or the shekel on the other, if the shekel and talent were to remain unchanged. And even apart from this, the division of the sixty into twenty, twenty-five, and fifteen still remains inexplicable, and can hardly be satisfactorily accounted for in the manner proposed by the Rabbins, namely, that there were pieces of money in circulation of the respective weights of twenty, twenty-five, and fifteen shekels, for the simple reason that no historical trace of the existence of any such pieces can be found, apart from the passage before us.<p>(Note: It is true that Const. l'Empereur has observed, in the Discursus ad Lectorem prefixed to the Paraphrasis Joseph. Jachiadae in Danielem, that "as God desired that justice should be preserved in all things, He noticed the various coins, and commanded that they should have their just weight. One coin, according to Jewish testimony, was of twenty shekels, a second of twenty-five, and a third of fifteen shekels; and as these together made one mina, according to the command of God, in order that it might be manifest that each had its proper quantity, He directed that they should be weighed against the mina, so that it might be known whether each had its own weight by means of the mina, to which they ought to be equal." But the Jewish witnesses (Judaei testes) are no other than the Rabbins of the Middle Ages, Sal. Jarchi (Raschi), Dav. Kimchi, and Abrabanel, who attest the existence of these pieces of money, not on the ground of historical tradition, but from an inference drawn from this verse.  The much earlier Targumist knows nothing whatever of them, but paraphrases the words thus: "the third part of a mina has twenty shekels; a silver mina, five and twenty shekels; the fourth part of a mina, fifteen shekels; all sixty are a mina; and a great mina (i.e., probably one larger than the ordinary, or civil mina) shall be holy to you;" from which all that can be clearly learned is, that he found in the words of the prophet a mina of sixty shekels. A different explanation is given by the lxx, whose rendering, according to the Cod. Vatic. (Tischendorf), runs as follows: &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;; and according to the Cod. Al.: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;. Boeckh (Metrol. Untersuch. pp. 54ff.) and Bertheau (Zur Gesch. der Isr. pp. 9ff.) regard the latter as the original text, and punctuate it thus: &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, - interpreting the whole verse as follows: "the weight once fixed shall remain unaltered, and unadulterated in its original value: namely, a shekel shall contain ten gerahs; five shekels, or a five-shekel piece, shall contain exactly five; and so also a ten-shekel piece, exactly ten shekels; and the mina shall contain fifty shekels."  But however this explanation may appear to commend itself, and although for this reason it has been adopted by Hvernick and by the author of this commentary in his Bibl. Archol., after a repeated examination of the matter I cannot any longer regard it as well-founded, but am obliged to subscribe to the view held by Hitzig and Kliefoth, "that this rendering of the lxx carries on the face of it the probability of its resting upon nothing more than an attempt to bring the text into harmony with the ordinary value of the mina." For apart from the fact that nothing is known of the existence of five and ten shekel pieces, it is impossible to get any intelligible meaning from the words, that five shekels are to be worth five shekels, and ten shekels worth ten shekels, as it was self-evident that five shekels could not be worth either four shekels or six.)<p>And the other attempts that have been made to explain the difficult words are no satisfactory. The explanation given by Cocceius and J. D. Michaelis (Supplem. ad lex. p. 1521), that three different minas are mentioned, - a smaller one of fifteen Mosaic shekels, a medium size of twenty shekels, and a large one of twenty-five-is open to the objection justly pointed out by Bertheau, that in an exact definition of the true weight of anything we do not expect three magnitudes, and the purely arbitrary assumption of three different minas is an obvious subterfuge. The same thing applies to Hitzig's explanation, that the triple division, twenty, twenty-five, and fifteen shekels, has reference to the three kinds of metal used for coinage, viz., gold, silver, and copper, so that the gold mina was worth, or weighed, twenty shekels; the silver mina, twenty-five; and the copper mina, fifteen, - which has no tenable support in the statement of Josephus, that the shekel coined by Simon was worth four drachms; and is overthrown by the incongruity in the relation in which it places the gold to the silver, and both these metals to the copper. - There is evidently a corruption of very old standing in the words of the text, and we are not in possession of the requisite materials for removing it by emendation.</body></html>
