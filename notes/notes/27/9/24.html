Possibly, also, the language (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm" title="In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.">Daniel 10:2</a>, margin “weeks of days”) implies that “weeks of days” are not intended here. On the other hand, it is remarkable that in <a href="/context/leviticus/25-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,">Leviticus 25:1-10</a> the word week should not have been used to signify a period of seven years, if year-weeks are implied in this passage. However, it is generally assumed that we must understand the weeks to consist of years and not of days (see Pusey’s <span class= "ital">Daniel,</span> pp. 165, 166), the principle of year-weeks depending upon <a href="/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.">Leviticus 26:34</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/4-6.htm" title="And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.">Ezekiel 4:6</a>. The word “week” in itself furnishes a clue to the meaning. It implies a “Heptad,” and is not necessarily more definite than the “time” mentioned in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Are determined.—</span>The word only occurs in this passage. Theod. translates <span class= "greekheb">συνετμήθησαν</span><span class= "ital">;</span> LXX., <span class= "greekheb">ἐκρίθησαν</span>; Jer. “<span class= "ital">abbreviatœ sunt</span>.” In Chaldee the word means “to cut,” and in that sense “to determine.”<p>The object “determined” is twofold: (1) transgression and sin; (2) reconciliation and righteousness.<p><span class= "bld">To finish.</span>—The Hebrew margin gives an alternative rendering, “to restrain,” according to which the meaning is “to hold sin back” and to “prevent it from spreading.” If this reading is adopted it will be parallel to the second marginal alternative, “to seal up,” which also implies that the iniquity can no more increase. Although the alternative readings may be most in accordance with the Babylonian idea of “sealing sins,” the presence of the word “to seal” in the last clause of the verse makes it more probable that the marginal readings are due to the conjectures of some early critics, than that they once stood in the text. However, it must be observed that while St. Jerome translates the passage “<span class= "ital">ut consummetur prœvaricatio, et finem habeat peccatum</span>,” Theodotion supports the marginal reading “to seal.”<p><span class= "bld">To make reconciliation</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, atonement. (Comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-6.htm" title="By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.">Proverbs 16:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm" title="And he laid it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.">Isaiah 6:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-38.htm" title="But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.">Psalm 78:38</a>.) The two former clauses show that during the seventy weeks sin will cease. The prophet now brings out another side of the subject. There will be abundance of forgiveness in store for those who are willing to receive it.<p><span class= "bld">Everlasting righteousness.—</span>A phrase not occurring elsewhere. The prophet seems to be combining the notions of “righteousness” and “eternity,” which elsewhere are characteristics of Messianic prophecy. (<a href="/isaiah/46-13.htm" title="I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.">Isaiah 46:13</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/51-5.htm" title="My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust.">Isaiah 51:5-8</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm" title="His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.">Psalm 89:36</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm" title="And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-18.htm" title="But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.">Daniel 7:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm" title="And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.">Daniel 7:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To Seal Up.—</span><span class= "greekheb">σϕραγίσαι</span><span class= "ital">,</span> Theod.; <span class= "greekheb">συντελεσθῆναι</span>, LXX.; <span class= "ital">impleatur,</span> Jer.; the impression of the translators being that all visions and prophecies were to receive their complete fulfilment in the course of these seventy weeks. It appears, however, to be more agreeable to the context to suppose that the prophet is speaking of the absolute cessation of all prophecy. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1Corinthians 13:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To anoint the most Holy.—</span>The meaning of the sentence depends upon the interpretation of the words “Most Holy” or “Holy of Holies.” In Scripture they are used of (1) the altar (<a href="/exodus/29-37.htm" title="Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever touches the altar shall be holy.">Exodus 29:37</a>); (2) the atonement (<a href="/exodus/30-10.htm" title="And Aaron shall make an atonement on the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement on it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.">Exodus 30:10</a>); (3) the tabernacle and the sacred furniture (<a href="/exodus/30-29.htm" title="And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them shall be holy.">Exodus 30:29</a>); (4) the sacred perfume (<a href="/exodus/30-36.htm" title="And you shall beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with you: it shall be to you most holy.">Exodus 30:36</a>); (5) the remnant of the meat offering (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm" title="And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-10.htm" title="And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.">Leviticus 2:10</a>); (6) all that touch the offerings made by fire (<a href="/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it.

Which of these significations is to be here adopted can only be discovered by the context. Now from the careful manner in which this and the following verse are connected by the words “Know therefore,” it appears that the words “most Holy” are parallel to “Messiah the Prince” (<a href="/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>), and that they indicate a person. (See <a href="/leviticus/6-18.htm" title="All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that touches them shall be holy.">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-13.htm" title="The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.">1Chronicles 23:13</a>.) This was the opinion of the Syriac translator, who renders the words “Messiah the most Holy,” and of the LXX. <span class= "greekheb">εὐϕρᾶναι ἃγιον ἁγίων</span><span class= "ital">,</span> on which it has been remarked that <span class= "greekheb">εὐϕρᾶναι</span> would have no meaning if applied to a place, and the phrase employed in this version for the sanctuary is invariably <span class= "greekheb">τὸ ἃγιον τῶν ἁγίων</span>. Any reference to Zerubbabel’s temple, or to the dedication of the temple by Judas Maccabæus, is opposed to the context.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS G: THE SEVENTY WEEKS (Daniel 9:24).</span><p>It may be questioned in what way this prophecy presents any meaning to those who follow the punctuation of the Hebrew text, and put the principal stop in <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a> after “seven weeks,” instead of after “three score and two weeks.” The translation would be as follows, “From the going out . . . until Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks; and during sixty-two weeks the city shall be rebuilt . . . and after sixty-two weeks shall Messiah be cut off” . . . This can only be explained upon the hypothesis that the word “week” is used in an indefinite sense to mean a period. The sense is then as follows:—The period from the command of Cyrus or of Artaxerxes to rebuild Jerusalem, down to the time of Messiah, consisted of seven such weeks; during the sixty-two weeks that followed the kingdom of Messiah is to be established amidst much persecution. During the last week the persecution will be so intense that Messiah may be said to be annihilated by it, His kingdom on earth being destroyed. At the end of the last week the Antichristian prince who organises the persecution is himself exterminated, and destroyed in the final judgment.<p>According to this view the seventy weeks occupy the whole period that intervenes between the times of Cyrus or Artaxerxes and the last judgment. The principal objection to it is that it gives no explanation of the numbers “seven” and “sixty-two,” which seem to have been chosen for some particular purpose. Nor does it furnish any reason for the choice of the word “weeks” instead of “times” or “seasons,” either of which words would have equally served the same indefinite purpose.<p>The traditional interpretation follows the punctuation of Theodotion, which St. Jerome also adopted, and reckons the seventy weeks from B.C. 458, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes. From this date, measuring seven weeks of years—that is, forty-nine years—we are brought to the date B.C. 409. It is predicted that during this period the walls of Jerusalem and the city itself should be rebuilt, though in troublous times. It must be remembered that very little is known of Jewish history during the times after Ezra and Nehemiah. The latest date given in Nehemiah is the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, or B.C. 446. It is highly probable that the city was not completely restored till nearly forty years later. Reckoning from B.C. 409 sixty-two weeks or 434 years, we are brought to A.D. 25, the year when our Saviour began His ministry. After three and a half years, or in the “midst of a week,” he was cut off. The seventy weeks end in A.D. 32, which is said to be the end of the second probation of Israel after rejecting the Messiah. The agreement between the dates furnished by history and prediction is very striking, and the general expectation that there prevailed about the appearance of a Messiah at the time of our Saviour’s first advent points to the antiquity as well as to the accuracy of the interpretation. However, the explanation of the latter half of the seven weeks is not satisfactory. We have no chronological account of events which occurred shortly after the Ascension, and there are no facts stated in the New Testament that lead us to suppose that Israel should have three and a half years’ probation after the rejection of the Messiah.<p>The modern explanation adheres in part to the Masoretic text, and regards the sixty-two year-weeks as beginning in B.C. 604. Reckoning onwards 434 years, we are brought to the year B.C. 170, in which Antiochus plundered the Temple and massacred 40,000 Jews. Onias III., the anointed prince, was murdered B.C. 176, just before the close of this period; and from the attack upon the Temple to the death of Antiochus, B.C. 164. was seven years, or one week, in the midst of which, B.C. 167, the offering was abolished, and the idolatrous altar erected in the Temple. The seven weeks are then calculated onwards from B.C. 166, and are stated to mean an indefinite period expressed by a round number, during which Jerusalem was rebuilt after its defilement by Antiochus. This explanation is highly unsatisfactory. It not only inverts the order of the weeks, but arbitrarily uses the word week in a double sense, in a definite and in an indefinite sense at once. There is still a graver objection to assuming that the starting point of the seventy weeks is the year B.C. 604. No command to rebuild Jerusalem had then gone forth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/daniel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a>. </span><span class="ital">Seventy weeks, </span>&c. — Weeks not of days, but of years, or, seventy times seven years, that is, four hundred and ninety years, each day being accounted a year according to the prophetic way of reckoning, (see note on <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>,) a way often used in Scripture, especially in reckoning the years of jubilee, which correspond with these numbers in Daniel: see <a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm" title="And you shall number seven sabbaths of years to you, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty and nine years.">Leviticus 25:8</a>. See also <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm" title="Fulfill her week, and we will give you this also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years.">Genesis 29:27</a>, where, to <span class="ital">fulfil her week, </span>is explained by performing another seven years’ service for Rachel; and <a href="/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a>, where we read, that according to <span class="ital">the number of the days </span>which the spies employed in searching out the land of Canaan, even forty days, the Israelites were condemned to bear their iniquities, even forty years. Thus God says likewise to Ezekiel, cotemporary with Daniel, <span class="ital">I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days. I have appointed thee </span>EACH DAY FOR A YEAR. Nor was this mode of expression in use only among the Jews; for Varro, speaking of himself, says, he was entered into the twelfth week of his age, at the close of which he would have been eighty-four years old. In these instances, the days evidently denote <span class="ital">solar </span>years, which were in use throughout the Jewish history; so that there is no probability that the angel should here intend any such singularity, as counting by <span class="ital">lunar </span>years. <span class="ital">Are determined upon, </span>or <span class="ital">concerning, thy people</span> — Hebrew <span class="greekheb">נחתךְ</span>, <span class="ital">are decided. </span>The great event specified was not to be protracted beyond this period, fixed and determined in the counsels of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">To finish the transgression — </span>The reader will observe, the expression is not, <span class="ital">to finish transgressions, </span>but <span class="greekheb">הפשׂע</span>, <span class="ital">the transgression; </span>a word which is derived from a theme which signifies, “to revolt, to rebel, to be contumacious, to refuse subjection to rightful authority, or obedience to a law which we ought to observe.” To <span class="ital">finish </span>such transgression, is expressed by a word (<span class="greekheb">לכלא</span>) which denotes universality, to cancel, or annihilate. Dr. Apthorp, in his <span class="ital">Discourses on Prophecy, </span>vol. 1. p. 262, justly observes, that the diversity of expression respecting the several benefits here promised to the world by the Messiah, may be well supposed to intend so many distinct and determinate ideas. “In a prophecy of such moment,” says he, “we cannot suppose a mere co-acervation of synonymous terms, but each word is emphatic, and proper to its subject. The appropriate sense of each may be investigated, from their use and significance in other passages of Holy Scripture.” Accordingly, by the word <span class="ital">transgression, </span>he here understands man’s first disobedience, with its direful effects, the depravation and mortality of human nature. And by <span class="ital">finishing </span>this transgression he understands, “cancelling the primeval guilt of Adam’s apostacy, and reversing the sentence of mortality then passed on all the human race.” In other words we may properly understand by the expression, the abolishing the guilt and fatal effects of that disobedience, in such a manner that no man shall perish eternally merely on account of the sin of our first parents, or the depravity entailed upon us thereby; to counteract the influence of which, sufficient grace is procured for us, and offered to us in the gospel of Christ. Concerning this first benefit of our redemption, the apostle treats explicitly <a href="/context/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:...">Romans 5:12-21</a>, a passage which the reader is particularly requested carefully to consider, as containing a full justification of the exposition here given of the first clause of this verse; man’s first disobedience, termed by the apostle <span class="ital">the one offence, </span>and <span class="ital">the offence of one, </span>being represented by him as introducing death into the world, and all our misery; and the <span class="ital">obedience, </span>or <span class="ital">righteousness of one, </span>and <span class="ital">the free gift, </span>procured for all mankind, and actually conferred on all penitent believers, as the one meritorious cause and source of our salvation. “No words can express, or thought conceive, the greatness of this redemption. Imagination faints under the idea of a Divine Benefactor effacing sin, annihilating death, and restoring eternal life.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And to make an end of sins — </span>“As, in the appropriate sense of the words, <span class="ital">the transgression </span>denotes one original act of apostacy and rebellion against a positive command of God; <span class="ital">sins, </span>in the plural, emphatically express all the <span class="ital">vices </span>[offences] against conscience, all the <span class="ital">crimes </span>against civil society, and all <span class="ital">sins </span>against God, which have ever reigned among men. The redemption by Christ hath abolished all the fatal effects of moral evil, with respect to such as believe and obey the gospel;” not only cancelling their actual guilt by a gracious remission, but even renewing their fallen nature, stamping them with the divine image, and thus both entitling them to, and preparing them for, the immortality lost by the fall.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And to make reconciliation for iniquity — </span>In these words is expressed the manner in which our redemption from death and sin hath been effected. “The word <span class="greekheb">כפר</span>, rendered <span class="ital">reconciliation </span>here, is the etymon of our English word, <span class="ital">to cover. </span>Its primary meaning is, to <span class="ital">hide, </span>or <span class="ital">conceal, </span>the surface of any substance, by inducing another substance over it. Thus the ark is commanded to be <span class="ital">pitched, </span>or <span class="ital">covered, </span>within and without, to secure it from the waters of the deluge. Sin, when grievous, and ripe for punishment, is said to be <span class="ital">before </span>God, or <span class="ital">in his sight: </span>a propitiation is the <span class="ital">covering </span>of sin, [procuring] God’s hiding his face from our sins, and blotting out our iniquities: see <a href="/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a>; <a href="/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>. The word <span class="ital">redemption </span>implies a price paid for those who are set at liberty: the price is the blood of Christ; that blood a sacrifice; and the sacrifice an expiation for sinners, that is, for all mankind. This is the first and leading notion of the divine expedient for saving sinners, the sacrifice and blood of Christ. The second principal idea under which this redemption is represented, is that of <span class="ital">substitution, </span>and satisfaction, by another’s suffering for our guilt; and in this way of stating the doctrine, still the principal and leading idea is that of a sacrifice, and the blood of a victim;” namely, Christ’s <span class="ital">dying for the ungodly: </span>see <a href="/context/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly....">Romans 5:6-9</a>. Inasmuch as Christ, by dying in our stead, “hath prevented either the extinction or [eternal] misery of a whole species, and hath obtained for us a positive happiness, greater than we lost in Adam; every considerate man must think it fit, that to effect such a redemption, some great expedient should be proposed by God himself, to vindicate his wisdom and moral government, in suffering so much vice and confusion to end so happily.” Add to this, that “so congenial to the most generous sentiments of the human mind is the idea of one devoting himself for another, for many, and for all, that all antiquity abounds with such examples and opinions. Not that the Scripture doctrine of Christ’s satisfaction, in itself so luminous, needs any support from foreign testimony; but it is certain that a general consent, founded in nature, or divine institution, or both, hath led men to seek expiation of conscious guilt, in the way of voluntary substitution, and vicarious devotement. The chief reason of that prejudice, which is by some entertained against a doctrine so essential to peace of conscience, is founded on inattention to ancient religious customs. By the sacrifice of Christ, victims and sacrifices are abolished; but all the ancient religions abounded with them to a degree which we should think astonishing, and scarcely credible. Oceans of blood flowed round their altars; and the Levitical rites were instituted on purpose to adumbrate Christ’s expiation, and to introduce all that admirable spirituality and [pious] devotion, which is now the distinguishing excellence of Christianity.” — Dr. Apthorp.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">To bring in everlasting righteousness — </span>The three former particulars already considered import the removing the greatest evils; this, and the two following, imply the conferring of the greatest benefits, and all by Jesus Christ. This clause, says Dr. Apthorp, “may admit of two interpretations, which both concur in Christ, and are consistent with each other: our justification by faith in him, and our subsequent study [practice] of personal virtue. The first is a gratuitous act of Christ; the second is characteristic of his true disciples. In the former sense, Jeremiah styles him by his divine title, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. And in both senses Christ Jesus is made unto us <span class="ital">wisdom </span>and <span class="ital">righteousness, sanctification </span>and <span class="ital">redemption.” </span>To speak a little more distinctly: to <span class="ital">bring in everlasting righteousness, </span>according to the gospel, evidently includes three things: 1st, To bring in Christ’s righteousness, or his obedience unto death, as the ground of our justification and title to eternal life, he being <span class="ital">the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. </span>2d, To bring holiness, the divine nature, or the Spirit of God, with his various graces, into our souls, making us conformable to his image, as our meetness for that future felicity. And, 3d, For our direction in the way that leads to it; to lay before us, for our observation, a complete rule of life and manners. Of this last particular, which Dr. Apthorp includes in the everlasting righteousness here spoken of, as being immutable in its obligations, and eternal in its sanctions, he speaks as follows: “When we consider the Christian morality in its ground of obligation, [namely, the will of God,] its principle of charity, and in its detail of special duties, we are struck with admiration at the simplicity and perfection of a rule of life, which, without any artificial system, extended the Jewish law, and combined all the excellences of Gentile philosophy; the elevation of Plato, without his mysticism; the reasonableness of Aristotle, without his contracted selfishness, and worldly views; tempering the rigour of Zeno with the moderation of Epicurus; while, by the greatness of its end, it reforms, refines, and elevates human nature from sense to spirit, from earth to heaven.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And seal up the vision and prophecy — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">ולחתם חזון ונביא</span>, <span class="ital">to seal vision and prophet; prophet </span>being put for <span class="ital">prophecy. </span>The words are a Hebraism, and when expressed in modern language signify, 1st, The accomplishing, and thereby confirming, all the ancient predictions relating to the most holy person here intended. God had spoken of the Messiah, by the mouths of his holy prophets, from the foundation of the world; had foretold his coming, pointed out the place of his birth, and specified the extraordinary circumstances of it; described the manner of his life, the nature of his doctrine, and the variety and splendour of his miracles, with the treatment he should receive from his countrymen; had foretold repeatedly, and set forth at large, his humiliation, sufferings, and death, his resurrection, ascension, and the glory that should follow. Now by making the events exactly to answer the predictions, he confirmed them, as the setting of a seal to any writing confirms its authenticity. 2d, To seat implies, to <span class="ital">finish, conclude, </span>and <span class="ital">put an end </span>to any thing. Thus also were the vision and prophecy sealed among the Jews. They were shut up and finished. The privilege and use of them were no longer to be continued in their church. And this also happened accordingly; for, by their own confession, from that day to this they have not enjoyed either vision or prophet. But, 3d, To seal, is to <span class="ital">consummate </span>and <span class="ital">perfect; </span>and to seal the vision and prophecy here, may include the adding the New Testament revelations and predictions to those of the Old, and thereby supplying what was wanting to perfect the book of God, and render it a complete system of divine revelation. It is only necessary to add, 4th, That as things are frequently sealed in order to their security, the preservation of the divine records and oracles included in both Testaments may be also here intended by the expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And to anoint the Most Holy — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">קדשׂ קדשׂים</span>, literally, the <span class="ital">holy of holiest </span>an expression often used of holy places, or things, especially of the most holy place of the Jewish tabernacle and temple. It is here very properly applied to the Messiah, whose sacred body was the temple of the Deity; agreeable to his own declaration, <span class="ital">Destroy this temple, </span>pointing to himself by some expressive action, <span class="ital">and in three days I will raise it up; </span>and who was <span class="ital">greater than the temple. </span>Now this most holy person, in whom <span class="ital">dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily, </span>and who, even as man, had the Holy Spirit <span class="ital">without measure, </span>was by that divine unction (which is here principally intended) at once designated and qualified for the sundry offices he was to sustain, especially the prophetic, sacerdotal, and kingly offices, for the various characters he was to bear, and the work he was to do on earth, and is now doing in heaven, and hence is properly termed <span class="ital">the Messiah, </span>or <span class="ital">the Anointed One. </span>To this may be added, that, as the Jewish temple was evidently a type of the church of God, especially the Christian Church, termed in the Psalms and Prophets <span class="ital">the city of God, </span>and <span class="ital">the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High; </span>by <span class="ital">anointing </span>the <span class="ital">holy of holies </span>here, may be also intended the effusion of the Holy Spirit, in his rich variety of gifts and graces, upon the Christian Church, foretold in innumerable passages of the Prophets, and eminently fulfilled, as the Acts of the Apostles, the epistles contained in the New Testament, and the writings of the ancient fathers abundantly prove. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seventy weeks are determined - Here commences the celebrated prophecy of the seventy weeks - a portion of Scripture Which has excited as much attention, and led to as great a variety of interpretation, as perhaps any other. Of this passage, Professor Stuart ("Hints on the Interpretation of Prophecy," p. 104) remarks, "It would require a volume of considerable magnitude even to give a history of the ever-varying and contradictory opinions of critics respecting this "locus vexatissimus; "and perhaps a still larger one to establish an exegesis which would stand. I am fully of opinion, that no interpretation as yet published will stand the test of thorough grammatico-historical criticism; and that a candid, and searching, and thorough "critique" here is still a "desideratum." May some expositor, fully adequate to the task, speedily appear!" After these remarks of this eminent Biblical scholar, it is with no great confidence of success that I enter on the exposition of the passage.<p>Yet, perhaps, though "all" difficulties may not be removed, and though I cannot hope to contribute anything "new" in the exposition of the passage, something may be written which may relieve it of some of the perplexities attending it, and which may tend to show that its author was under the influence of Divine inspiration. The passage may be properly divided into two parts. The first, in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>, contains a "general" statement of what would occur in the time specified - the seventy weeks; the second, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-27</a>, contains a "particular" statement of the manner in which that would be accomplished. In this statement, the whole time of the seventy weeks is broken up into three smaller portions of seven, sixty-two, and one - designating evidently some important epochs or periods <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>, and the last one week is again subdivided in such a way, that, while it is said that the whole work of the Messiah in confirming the covenant would occupy the entire week, yet that he would be cut off in the middle of the week, <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>.<p>In the "general" statement <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a> it is said that there was a definite time - seventy weeks - during which the subject of the prediction would be accomplished; that is, during which all that was to be done in reference to the holy city, or in the holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, etc., would be effected. The things specified in this verse are "what was to be done," as detailed more particularly in the subsequent verses. The design in this verse seems to have been to furnish a "general" statement of what was to occur in regard to the holy city - of that city which had been selected for the peculiar purpose of being a place where an atonement was to be made for human transgression. It is quite clear that when Daniel set apart this period for prayer, and engaged in this solemn act of devotion, his design was not to inquire into the ultimate events which would occur in Jerusalem, but merely to pray that the purpose of God, as predicted by Jeremiah, respecting the captivity of the nation, and the rebuilding of the city and temple, might be accomplished. God took occasion from this, however, not only to give an implied assurance about the accomplishment of these purposes, but also to state in a remarkable manner the "whole" ultimate design respecting the holy city, and the great event which was ever onward to characterize it among the cities of the world. In the consideration of the whole passage <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, it will be proper, first, to examine into the literal meaning of the words and phrases, and then to inquire into the fulfillment.<p>Seventy weeks - &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;  sha&#770;bu&#8219;&#305;&#770;ym sh&#305;&#770;b&#8219;&#305;&#770;ym. Vulgate, Septuaginta hebdomades. So Theodotion, &#x395;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  Hebdome&#772;konta hebdomades. Prof. Stuart ("Hints," p. 82) renders this "seventy sevens;" that is, seventy times seven years: on the ground that the word denoting "weeks" in the Hebrew is not &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;  sha&#770;bu&#8219;&#305;&#770;ym, but &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;  sha&#770;bu&#8219;o&#770;th. "The form which is used here," says he, "which is a regular masculine plural, is no doubt purposely chosen to designate the plural of seven; and with great propriety here, inasmuch as there are many sevens which are to be joined together in one common sum. Daniel had been meditating on the close of the seventy "years" of Hebrew exile, and the angel now discloses to him a new period of "seventy times seven," in which still more important events are to take place. Seventy sevens, or (to use the Greek phraseology), "seventy heptades," are determined upon thy people.<p>Heptades of what? Of days, or of years? No one can doubt what the answer is. Daniel had been making diligent search respecting the seventy "years;" and, in such a connection, nothing but seventy heptades of years could be reasonably supposed to be meant by the angel." The inquiry about the "gender" of the word, of which so much has been said (Hengstenberg, "Chris." ii. 297), does not seem to be very important, since the same result is reached whether it be rendered "seventy sevens," or "seventy weeks." In the former ease, as proposed by Prof. Stuart, it means seventy sevens of "years," or 490 years; in the other, seventy "weeks" of years; that is, as a "week of years" is seven years, seventy such weeks, or as before, 490 years. The usual and proper meaning of the word used here, however - &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;  sha&#770;bu&#770;a&#8219;a is a "seven," &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2;  hebdomas, i. e., a week. - Gesenius, "Lexicon" From the "examples" where the word occurs it would seem that the masculine or the feminine forms were used indiscriminately.<p>The word occurs only in the following passages, in all of which it is rendered "week," or "weeks," except in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-21.htm">Ezekiel 45:21</a>, where it is rendered "seven," to wit, days. In the following passages the word occurs in the masculine form plural, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>; in the following in the feminine form plural, <a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9-10</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/45-21.htm">Ezekiel 45:21</a>; and in the following in the singular number, common gender, rendered "week," <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27-28</a>, and in the dual masculine in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/12-5.htm">Leviticus 12:5</a>, rendered "two weeks." From these passages it is evident that nothing certain can be determined about the meaning of the word from its gender. It would seem to denote "weeks," periods of seven days - "hebdomads" - in either form, and is doubtless so used here. The fair translation would be, weeks seventy are determined; that is, seventy times seven days, or four hundred and ninety "days." But it may be asked here, whether this is to be taken literally, as denoting four hundred and ninety days? If not, in what sense is it to be understood? and why do we understand it in a different sense? It is clear that it must be explained literally as denoting four hundred and ninety "days," or that these days must stand for years, and that the period is four hundred and ninety "years." That this latter is the true interpretation, as it has been held by all commentators, is apparent from the following considerations:<p>(a) This is not uncommon in the prophetic writings. See the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24-28</a>. (See also Editor's Preface to volume on Revelation.)<p>(b) Daniel had been making inquiry respecting the seventy "years," and it is natural to suppose that the answer of the angel would have respect to "years" also; and, thus understood, the answer would have met the inquiry pertinently - " not seventy years, but a week of years - seven times seventy years." Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-22</a>. "In such a connection, nothing but seventy heptades of years could be reasonably supposed to be meant by the angel." - Prof. Stuart's "Hints," etc., p. 82.<p>(c) Years, as Prof. Stuart remarks, are the measure of all considerable periods of time. When the angel speaks, then, in reference to certain events, and declares that they are to take place during "seventy heptades," it is a matter of course to suppose that he means years.<p>(d) The circumstances of the case demand this interpretation. Daniel was seeking comfort in view of the fact that the city and temple had been desolate now for a period of seventy years. The angel comes to bring him consolation, and to give him assurances about the rebuilding of the city, and the great events that were to occur there. But what consolation would it be to be told that the city would indeed be rebuilt, and that it would continue seventy ordinary weeks - that is, a little more than a year, before a new destruction would come upon it? It cannot well be doubted, then, that by the time here designated, the angel meant to refer to a period of four hundred and ninety years; and if it be asked why this number was not literally and exactly specified in so many words, instead of choosing a mode of designation comparatively so obscure, it may be replied,<p>(1) that the number "seventy" was employed by Daniel as the time respecting which he was making inquiry, and that there was a propriety that there should be a reference to that fact in the reply of the angel - "one" number seventy had been fulfilled in the desolations of the city, there would be "another" number seventy in the events yet to occur;<p>(2) this is in the usual prophetic style, where there is, as Hengstenberg remarks ("Chris." ii. 299), often a "concealed definiteness." It is usual to designate numbers in this way.<p>(3) The term was sufficiently clear to be understood, or is, at all events, made clear by the result. There is no reason to doubt that Daniel would so understand it, or that it would be so interpreted, as fixing in the minds of the Jewish people the period when the Messiah was about to appear. The meaning then is, that there would be a period of four hundred and ninety years, during which the city, after the order of the rebuilding should go forth <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>, until the entire consummation of the great object for which it should be rebuilt: and that then the purpose would be accomplished, and it would be given up to a greater ruin. There was to be this long period in which most important transactions were to occur in the city.<p>Are determined - The word used here (&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;&#1498;  nechettak from &#1495;&#1514;&#1498;  cha&#770;tak) occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. It properly means, according to Gesenius, to cut off, to divide; and hence, to deterinine, to destine, to appoint. Theodotion renders it, sunetmeetheesan - are cut off, decided, defined. The Vulgate renders it, "abbreviate sunt." Luther, "Sind bestimmet" - are determined. The meaning would seem to be, that this portion of time - the seventy weeks - was "cut off" from the whole of duration, or cut out of it, as it were, and set by itself for a definite purpose. It does not mean that it was cut off from the time which the city would naturally stand, or that this time was "abbreviated," but that a portion of time - to wit, four hundred and ninety years - was designated or appointed with reference to the city, to accomplish the great and important object which is immediately specified. A certain, definite period was fixed on, and when this was past, the promised Messiah would come. In regard to the construction here - the singular verb with a plural noun, see Hengstenberg, "Christ. in, loc." The true meaning seems to be, that the seventy weeks are spoken of "collectively," as denoting a period of time; that is, a period of seventy weeks is determined. The prophet, in the use of the singular verb, seems to have contemplated the time, not as separate weeks, or as particular portions, but as one period.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Seventy weeks&#8212;namely, of years; literally, "Seventy sevens"; seventy heptads or hebdomads; four hundred ninety years; expressed in a form of "concealed definiteness" [Hengstenberg], a usual way with the prophets. The Babylonian captivity is a turning point in the history of the kingdom of God. It terminated the free Old Testament theocracy. Up to that time Israel, though oppressed at times, was; as a rule, free. From the Babylonian captivity the theocracy never recovered its full freedom down to its entire suspension by Rome; and this period of Israel's subjection to the Gentiles is to continue till the millennium (Re 20:1-15), when Israel shall be restored as head of the New Testament theocracy, which will embrace the whole earth. The free theocracy ceased in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, and the fourth of Jehoiakim; the year of the world 3338, the point at which the seventy years of the captivity begin. Heretofore Israel had a right, if subjugated by a foreign king, to shake off the yoke (Jud 4:1-5:31; 2Ki 18:7) as an unlawful one, at the first opportunity. But the prophets (Jer 27:9-11) declared it to be God's will that they should submit to Babylon. Hence every effort of Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah to rebel was vain. The period of the world times, and of Israel's depression, from the Babylonian captivity to the millennium, though abounding more in afflictions (for example, the two destructions of Jerusalem, Antiochus' persecution, and those which Christians suffered), contains all that was good in the preceding ones, summed up in Christ, but in a way visible only to the eye of faith. Since He came as a servant, He chose for His appearing the period darkest of all as to His people's temporal state. Always fresh persecutors have been rising, whose end is destruction, and so it shall be with the last enemy, Antichrist. As the Davidic epoch is the point of the covenant-people's highest glory, so the captivity is that of their lowest humiliation. Accordingly, the people's sufferings are reflected in the picture of the suffering Messiah. He is no longer represented as the theocratic King, the Antitype of David, but as the Servant of God and Son of man; at the same time the cross being the way to glory (compare Da 9:1-27 with Da 2:34, 35, 44; 12:7). In the second and seventh chapters, Christ's first coming is not noticed, for Daniel's object was to prophesy to his nation as to the whole period from the destruction to the re-establishment of Israel; but this ninth chapter minutely predicts Christ's first coming, and its effects on the covenant people. The seventy weeks date thirteen years before the rebuilding of Jerusalem; for then the re-establishment of the theocracy began, namely, at the return of Ezra to Jerusalem, 457 B.C. So Jeremiah's seventy years of the captivity begin 606 B.C., eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem, for then Judah ceased to exist as an independent theocracy, having fallen under the sway of Babylon. Two periods are marked in Ezra: (1) The return from the captivity under Jeshua and Zerubbabel, and rebuilding of the temple, which was the first anxiety of the theocratic nation. (2) The return of Ezra (regarded by the Jews as a second Moses) from Persia to Jerusalem, the restoration of the city, the nationality, and the law. Artaxerxes, in the seventh year of his reign, gave him the commission which virtually includes permission to rebuild the city, afterwards confirmed to, and carried out by, Nehemiah in the twentieth year (Ezr 9:9; 7:11, &c.). Da 9:25, "from the going forth of the commandment to build Jerusalem," proves that the second of the two periods is referred to. The words in Da 9:24 are not, "are determined upon the holy city," but "upon thy people and thy holy city"; thus the restoration of the religious national polity and the law (the inner work fulfilled by Ezra the priest), and the rebuilding of the houses and walls (the outer work of Nehemiah, the governor), are both included in Da 9:25, "restore and build Jerusalem." "Jerusalem" represents both the city, the body, and the congregation, the soul of the state. Compare Ps 46:1-11; 48:1-14; 87:1-7. The starting-point of the seventy weeks dated from eighty-one years after Daniel received the prophecy: the object being not to fix for him definitely the time, but for the Church: the prophecy taught him that the Messianic redemption, which he thought near, was separated from him by at least a half millennium. Expectation was sufficiently kept alive by the general conception of the time; not only the Jews, but many Gentiles looked for some great Lord of the earth to spring from Judea at that very time [Tacitus, Histories, 5.13; Suetonius, Vespasian, 4]. Ezra's placing of Daniel in the canon immediately before his own book and Nehemiah's was perhaps owing to his feeling that he himself brought about the beginning of the fulfilment of the prophecy (Da 9:20-27) [Auberlen].<p>determined&#8212;literally, "cut out," namely, from the whole course of time, for God to deal in a particular manner with Jerusalem.<p>thy &#8230; thy&#8212;Daniel had in his prayer often spoken of Israel as "Thy people, Thy holy city"; but Gabriel, in reply, speaks of them as Daniel's ("thy &#8230; thy") people and city, God thus intimating that until the "everlasting righteousness" should be brought in by Messiah, He could not fully own them as His [Tregelles] (compare Ex 32:7).

The seventy years' exile was a punishment, but not a full atonement, for the sin of the people; this would come only after seventy prophetic weeks, through Messiah.<p>make an end of&#8212;The Hebrew reading, "to steal," that is, to hide out of sight (from the custom of sealing up things to be concealed, compare Job 9:7), is better supported.<p>make reconciliation for&#8212;literally, "to cover," to overlay (as with pitch, Ge 6:14). Compare Ps 32:1.<p>bring in everlasting righteousness&#8212;namely, the restoration of the normal state between God and man (Jer 23:5, 6); to continue eternally (Heb 9:12; Re 14:6).<p>seal up &#8230; vision &#8230; prophecy&#8212;literally, "prophet."

The propitiatory in the temple (the same Greek word expresses the mercy seat and propitiation, Ro 3:25), which the Jews looked for at the restoration from Babylon, shall have its true realization only in Messiah. For it is only when sin is "made an end of" that God's presence can be perfectly manifested. As to "anoint," compare Ex 40:9, 34. Messiah was anointed with the Holy Ghost (Ac 4:27; 10:38). So hereafter, God-Messiah will "anoint" or consecrate with His presence the holy place at Jerusalem (Jer 3:16, 17; Eze 37:27, 28), after its pollution by Antichrist, of which the feast of dedication after the pollution by Antiochus was a type.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Seventy weeks:</span> these weeks are weeks of days, and these days are so many years; though neither days, nor months, nor years are expressed, (which makes it somewhat the more obscure,) but weeks only.

Or, "concerning thy people, and concerning thy holy city" (s); that is, such a space of time is fixed upon; "cut out" (t), as the word signifies; or appointed of God for the accomplishment of certain events, relative to the temporal good of the city and people of the Jews; as the rebuilding of their city and temple; the continuance of them as a people, and of their city; the coming of the Messiah to them, to obtain spiritual blessings for them, and for all the people of God; who also were Daniel's people and city in a spiritual sense, to which he belonged; and likewise what was relative to the utter ruin and destruction of the Jews as a people, and of their city: and this space of "seventy" weeks is not to be understood of weeks of days; which is too short a time for the fulfilment of so many events as are mentioned; nor were they fulfilled within such a space of time; but of weeks of years, and make up four hundred and ninety years; within which time, beginning from a date after mentioned, all the things prophesied of were accomplished; and this way of reckoning of years by days is not unusual in the sacred writings; see <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>. The verb used is singular, and, joined with the noun plural, shows that every week was cut out and appointed for some event or another; and the word, as it signifies "to cut", aptly expresses the division, or section of these weeks into distinct periods, as seven, sixty two, and one. The first events mentioned are spiritual ones, and are not ascribed to any particular period; but are what should be done within this compass of time in general, and were done toward the close of it; and are first observed because of the greatest importance, and are as follow: <p>to finish the transgression; not the transgression of Adam, or original sin, which, though took away by Christ from his people, yet not from all men; nor the actual transgression of man in general, which never more abounded than in the age in which Christ lived; but rather the transgressions of his people he undertook to satisfy for, and which were laid on him, and bore by him, and carried away, so as not to be seen more, or to have no damning power over them. The word used signifies "to restrain" (u); now, though sin greatly abounded, both among Jews and Gentiles, in the age of the Messiah; yet there never was an age in which greater restraints were laid on it than in this, by the ministry of John the Baptist, and of Christ in Judea and by the apostles in the Gentile world: <p>and to make an end of sins; so that they shall be no more, but put away and abolished by the sacrifice and satisfaction of Christ for them, as to guilt and punishment; so that those, for whose sins satisfaction is made, no charge can be brought against them, nor the curse of the law reach them, nor any sentence of it be executed, or any punishment inflicted on them; but are entirely and completely saved from all their sins, and the sad effects of them. Our version follows the marginal reading; but the textual writing is, "to seal up sins" (w); which is expressive of the pardon of them procured by Christ; for things sealed are hid and covered, and so are sins forgiven, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>, <p>and to make reconciliation for iniquity: to expiate it, and make atonement for it; which was made by the sacrifice of Christ, by his sufferings and death; whereby the law and justice of God were fully satisfied, full reparation being made for the injury done by sin; and this was made for all kind of sin, expressed here by several words; and for all the sins, iniquities, and transgressions of the Lord's people; to do which was the grand end of Christ's coming into the world; see <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm">Hebrews 2:17</a>, and to bring in everlasting righteousness; which is true only of the righteousness of Christ, by which the law is magnified and made honourable, justice satisfied, and all that believe in him justified from all their sins: this Christ, by his obedience, sufferings, and death, has wrought out, and brought into the world; and which phase designs, not the manifestation of it in the Gospel; nor the act of imputation of it, which is Jehovah the Father's act; nor the application of it, which is by the Spirit of God; but Christ's actual working of it out by obeying the precept and bearing the penalty of the law: and this may be truly called "everlasting", or "the righteousness of ages" (x), of ages past; the righteousness by which the saints in all ages from the beginning of the world are justified; and which endures, and will endure, throughout all ages, to the justification of all that believe; it is a robe of righteousness that will never wear out; its virtue to justify will ever continue, being perfect; it will answer for the justified ones in a time to come, and has eternal life connected with it: <p>and to seal up the vision and prophecy; not to shut it up out of sight; rather to set a mark on it, by which it might be more clearly known; but to consummate and fulfil it: all prophecy is sealed up in Christ, and by him; he is the sum and substance of it; the visions and prophecies of the Old Testament relate to him, and have their accomplishment in him; some relate to his person and office; others to his coming into the world, the time, place, and manner of it; others to the great work of redemption and salvation he came about; and others to his miracles, sufferings, and death, and the glory that should follow; all which have been fulfilled: or, "to seal up the vision and prophet" (y); the prophets were until John, and then to cease, and have ceased ever since the times of Jesus; there has been no prophet among the Jews, they themselves do not deny it; Christ is come, the last and great Prophet of all, with a full revelation of the divine will, and no other is to be expected; all that pretend to set up a new scheme of things, either as to doctrine or worship, through pretended vision or prophecy, are to be disregarded: <p>and to anoint the most Holy; not literally the most holy place in the temple; figuratively, either heaven itself, anointed, and prepared for his people by the Messiah's ascension thither, and entrance into it; or rather most holy persons, the church and people of God, typified by the sanctuary, the temple of God; and in a comparative sense are most holy, and absolutely so, as washed in the blood of Christ, clothed with his righteousness, and sanctified by his Spirit; and by whom they are anointed, some in an extraordinary and others in an ordinary way, and all by the grace of Christ: or it may be best of all to understand this of the Messiah, as Aben Ezra and others do; who is holy in his person, in both his natures, human and divine; sanctified and set apart to his office, and holy in the execution of it; equal in holiness to the Father and the Spirit; superior in it to angels and men, who have all their holiness from him, and by whom they are sanctified; and of whom the sanctuary or temple was a type; and who was anointed with the Holy Ghost as man, at his incarnation, baptism, and ascension to heaven; and Abarbinel owns it may be interpreted of the Messiah, who may be called the Holy of holies, because he is holier than all other Israelites. <p>(s)  "de populo tuo", Helvicus.

As no object is called in particular ‘a most holy (thing),’ general considerations, viewed in the light of the context, can alone determine what is here intended. A material object, rather than a person, is certainly most naturally denoted by the expression, and most probably either the altar of burnt-offering (which was in particular desecrated by Antiochus Epiphanes), or the Temple generally, is what is meant. The term <span class="ital">anoint</span> is used both of the altar of burnt-offering in particular, and of the Tent of meeting and vessels belonging to it in general, in <a href="/exodus/29-36.htm" title="And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.">Exodus 29:36</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/30-26.htm" title="And you shall anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,...">Exodus 30:26-28</a> (cf. <a href="/context/exodus/40-9.htm" title="And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shall hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy....">Exodus 40:9-11</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/8-10.htm" title="And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them....">Leviticus 8:10-11</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;">Numbers 7:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-10.htm" title="And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.">Numbers 7:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-84.htm" title="This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was anointed, by the princes of Israel: twelve chargers of silver, twelve silver bowls, twelve spoons of gold:">Numbers 7:84</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-88.htm" title="And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty. This was the dedication of the altar, after that it was anointed.">Numbers 7:88</a>),—each time immediately preceding the passages quoted above for the use in the same connexion of the term ‘most holy.’ The consecration of a temple in the Messianic age (cf. <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm" title="All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you: they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.">Isaiah 60:7</a>; Ezekiel 40 ff.) is, no doubt, what is intended by the words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[337] The words ought however, perhaps, to be rendered (cf. A.V., R.V.) ‘that he should sanctify that which was most holy, he and his sons for ever,’—the reference being to the sanctuary and sacred vessels (cf. <a href="/exodus/30-29.htm" title="And you shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever touches them shall be holy.">Exodus 30:29</a><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.</span> The LXX. here differs from the above, "Seventy weeks are determined (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) upon thy people and the city Zion, to make an end of sin, to make unrighteousnesses rare (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and to wipe out the unrighteous-nesses, and to understand the vision, and to give (appoint) (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) everlasting righteousness, and to end the visions and the prophet, and to rejoice the holy of holies."

Neither of these seems to be the original of the Greek. Schleusner suggests to read <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Against this is the fact that Paulus Tellensis renders <span class="accented">lemaz'or</span>, "to bring to nothing" (<a href="/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>, Peshitta). How Wolf ('Siebzigwochen,' p. 26) can say the LXX. confirms the Massoretic K'thib, is difficult to see. The author of the first rendering of this phrase seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">ha</span>-<span class="accented">thath</span>) instead of <span class="accented">hatham</span>; the other translator must have read <span class="accented">mahah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to understand the vision," seems a doublet of the clause, "to seal up the vision." There seems to have been in one of the manuscripts used by the LXX. translator a transposition of words; for one of them must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lehoothan</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, since he renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This is an impossible change, but the mistaking of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> is perfectly easy to imagine, if <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> had been written in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, and it transferred to the place in the Massoretic text occupied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>, then we can easily understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. In the last clause the LXX. translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5d7;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;</span>, a clearly inferior reading. The impression conveyed to one is that the translators were able to put no intelligible meaning on the passage, and rendered the words successively as nearly as they could without attempting to make them sense. We must admit, however, that the phenomena that cause this impression may be due to corruption of the text. Theodotion renders, "Seventy weeks are determined (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) upon thy people and on the holy city, to seal sins and wipe away unrighteousness, and to atone for sin, and to bring the everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies." Theodotion, it will be seen, as the LXX., has "prophet" instead of "prophecy," which certainly is more verbally accurate than our version; he omits "to finish transgression," having instead, "to seal sins." The Peshitta has followed the K'thib and renders, "finish transgressions," and instead of "prophecy" has the "prophets." The text of the Vetus, as preserved to us by Tertullian, is, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">breviatae</span>) upon thy people, and upon the holy city, until sin shall grow old, and iniquities be marked (<span class="accented">signentur</span>), and righteousnesses rise up, and eternal righteousness be brought in, and that the vision and the prophet should be marked (<span class="accented">signetur</span>), and the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>) be anointed." Jerome renders, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">abbreviate sunt</span>)<span class="accented">upon</span> thy people and upon thy holy city, to end falsehood (<span class="accented">prevarieatio</span>), to end sin, to wipe out iniquity, to bring in the everlasting righteousness, to fulfil the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>)." The Hebrew here is peculiar; the word for "weeks" is in the masculine, which is unexampled elsewhere in the plural. The singular masculine is found, <span class="accented">e.g</span> <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>; there is no case of feminine singular. Mr. Galloway ('Shadow on the Sundial,' p. 51) would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>  <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and would render, "by weeks it is determined." There seems little evidence for this reading; against a few late manuscripts is the consensus of versions. "Determined" is also a word that occurs only Lore; it is Aramaic, but not common even in that language. It means "to cut off." It may thus refer to these weeks being "cut off" from time generally; hence "determined." It is singular, and its nominative is plural. "To finish" also causes difficulty; so translated, it implies that the word should be written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; but it is written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which means "to restrain," "to enclose," "to separate off" (Furst). Hence if we translate as it stands, it should be "restrain transgression." "To make an end of" in also "cause transgression to cease" This in a rendering of the Massoretic Q'ri; if the K'thib had been taken, the translation should rather have been "to seal." "Sins:" this word is plural in the K'thib, but singular in the Q'ri. A large number of manuscripts write the word plural; the Greek versions give the plural; the Pe-shista and Vulgate, Aquila and Paulus Tellensis, singular. "The prophecy," it is clearly an it stands "the prophet." Jerome is the only one of the versions that takes the word in the sense in which it is taken in our versions. Professor Bevan renders it "prophet" (so Hitzig and Hengstenberg). One is tempted to adopt the reading of Michaelis <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, "the vision of the prophet," which has some manuscript authority (Wolf, 'Siebzigwochen,' p. 15). The overwhelming mass of evidence is in favour of the present consonantal text. <span class="accented">Seventy weeks.</span> "Week," while generally a week of days (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>), was occasionally week of years, as <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>, "fulfil the week of this," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the seven years of service. Among the later Jews this became a recognized mode of reckoning, as in the Book of Jubilees, each jubilee in divided into successive weeks. From what follows it is necessary that the weeks here are sevens of years. "Are determined," as already indicated, means "cut off," not "shortened," which does not seem to be the meaning of the word in any case. "Upon thy people and upon thy holy city." Daniel has been praying long and earnestly for his people; so there would be no inability to see what was meant by "his city and his people." "To finish transgression" is equivalent to "to restrain transgression." Transgression is apt to become bold and imperious; it is a great deal when it is even somewhat "restrained." It is to be noted that, as Daniel's prayer was greatly confession of the sins of the people and prayer for forgiveness, the promises here are largely moral; but still the Messianic period even was not to be expected to be one in which there will be no sin - it is to be restrained. "To make an end of sins" - though "to seal sins" seems the better reading diplomatically it is the K'thib, and that of some of the versions. It is difficult to give the phrase an intelligible meaning. Moreover, the occurrence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> so immediately after is against it. Something may be said for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>, which occurs in a similar connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5de;&#x5dd;</span> that this does in <a href="/lamentations/4-22.htm">Lamentations 4:22</a>. This is the reading of one of the translators in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - the spirit of lawlessness would be restrained and the past iniquities and their guilt wiped away. "To make reconciliation " - "to make an atonement." The verb used is the technical word, "the offering of an atoning sacrifice." In this sense it occurs some fifty times in Leviticus. This might apply to the renewal of sacrificial offerings in the temple after the fifty years' cessation during the Babylonian captivity, or to the renewal after the shorter cessation under the oppression inflicted on the Jews under Epiphanes. The next clause implies a wider application and a loftier sacrifice. Professor Bevan is right in maintaining that, despite the accents, this clause is to be connected with the next. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">bring in everlasting righteousness.</span> This is more than merely the termination of the suit of God against his people (<a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>). The phrase occurs in <a href="/psalms/119-142.htm">Psalm 119:142</a>, and is applied to the righteousness of God. These two, "atonement for sin" and "the everlasting righteousness," are found in Christ - his atoning death and the righteousness which he brings into the world. It is true that when Daniel heard these words spoken by Gabriel he might not put any very distinct meaning on them - in that he was but like other prophets; the prophets did not know the meaning of their own prophecies. <span class="accented">To seal up the vision and prophecy</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">to seal vision and prophet - to</span> set to them the seal of fulfilment (von Lengerke, Hitzig, Bevan). This does not refer to Jeremiah, because his prophecy referred merely to the return from Babylon, and this refers to a period which is to continue long after that. Jeremiah's prophecy was about to be verified. This new prophecy required four hundred and ninety years ere it received its verification. Some event to happen nearly half a millennium after Daniel is to prove the prophecy God has given him to be true. <span class="accented">And to anoint the Most Holy.</span> This phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh qodasheem</span>), is used some forty times in Scripture, but almost always of things, as the altar and the innermost sanctuary (Bevan, 155). Hengstenberg ('Christ.,' 3:119) points out that the phrase for "sanctuary"  is "<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;</span>, with the article. He appeals to <a href="/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a> as a case where, without the article, the phrase applies to an individual, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">vayibba-dayl Aheron leheqdeesho qodesh qadasheem</span>), "And he separated Aaron to sanctify him as a holy of holies." This seems almost the necessary translation, despite the versions; for the prenominal suffix must be the object, and "holy of holies" must be in apposition to it. The act of anointing as a sign of consecration, though applied to the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9</a>), to the altar (<a href="/exodus/40-10.htm">Exodus 40:10</a>), the laver (<a href="/exodus/40-11.htm">Exodus 40:11</a>), is never applied to the holy of holies. It is applied most frequently to persons; as to Aaron (<a href="/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>), to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), to David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-3.htm">1 Samuel 16:3</a>). The words of Gabriel thus point forward to a time when all iniquity shall be restrained, sin atoned for, and a priest anointed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Daniel adds to his interpretation of the dream the warning to the king to break off his sins by righteousness and mercy, so that his tranquillity may be lengthened. Daniel knew nothing of a heathen Fatum, but he knew that the judgments of God were directed against men according to their conduct, and that punishment threatened could only be averted by repentance; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7</a>.; <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>.; <a href="/isaiah/38-1.htm">Isaiah 38:1</a>. This way of turning aside the threatened judgment stood open also for Nebuchadnezzar, particularly as the time of the fulfilment of the dream was not fixed, and thus a space was left for repentance. The counsel of Daniel is interpreted by Berth., Hitz., and others, after Theodotion, the Vulgate, and many Church Fathers and Rabbis, as teaching the doctrine of holiness by works held by the later Jews, for they translate it: redeem thy sins by well-doing (Hitz.: buy freedom from thy sins by alms), and thy transgressions by showing mercy to the poor.<p>(Note: Theodot. translates: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;. The Vulg.: et peccata tua eleemosynis redime et iniquitates tuas misericordiis pauperum. Accordingly, the Catholic Church regards this passage as a locus classicus for the doctrine of the merit of works, against which the Apologia Conf. August. first set forth the right exposition.)<p>But this translation of the first passage is verbally false; for &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; does not mean to redeem, to ransom, and &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; does not mean alms or charity. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; means to break off, to break in pieces, hence to separate, to disjoin, to put at a distance; see under <a href="/genesis/21-40.htm">Genesis 21:40</a>. And though in the Targg. &#1508;&#1512;&#1511; is used for &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, to loosen, to unbind, of redeeming, ransoming of the first-born, an inheritance or any other valuable possession, yet this use of the word by no means accords with sins as the object, because sins are not goods which one redeems or ransoms so as to retain them for his own use. &#1495;&#1496;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1511; can only mean to throw away sins, to set one's self free from sins. &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; nowhere in the O.T. means well-doing or alms. This meaning the self-righteous Rabbis first gave to the word in their writings. Daniel recommends the king to practise righteousness as the chief virtue of a ruler in contrast to the unrighteousness of the despots, as Hgstb., Hv., Hofm., and Klief. have justly observed. To this also the second member of the verse corresponds. As the king should practise righteousness toward all his subjects, so should he exercise mercy toward the oppressed, the miserable, the poor. Both of these virtues are frequently named together, e.g., <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, as virtues of the Messiah. &#1495;&#1496;&#1497;&#1497;&#1498; is the plur. of &#1495;&#1496;&#1497;, as the parallel &#1506;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498; shows, and the Keri only the later abbreviation or defective suffix-formation, as <a href="/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-10.htm">Daniel 5:10</a>.<p>The last clause of this verse is altogether misunderstood by Theodotion, who translates it &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and by the Vulgate, where it is rendered by forsitan ignoscet delictis tuis, and by many older interpreters, where they expound &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; in the sense of &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, patience, and derive &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, to fail, to go astray (cf. <a href="/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>). &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1488; means continuance, or length of time, as <a href="/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, rest, safety, as the Hebr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, here the peaceful prosperity of life; and &#1492;&#1503;, neither ecce nor forsitan, si forte, but simply if, as always in the book of Daniel.<p>Daniel places before the king, as the condition of the continuance of prosperity of life, and thereby implicite of the averting of the threatened punishment, reformation of life, the giving up of injustice and cruelty towards the poor, and the practice of righteousness and mercy. </body></html>
