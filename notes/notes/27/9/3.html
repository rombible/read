God's promises are to encourage our prayers, not to make them needless; and when we see the performance of them approaching, we should more earnestly plead them with God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I set my face unto the Lord God - Probably the meaning is, that he turned his face toward Jerusalem, the place where God had dwelt; the place of his holy abode on earth. See the notes at <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>. The language, however, would not be inappropriate to denote prayer without such a supposition. We turn to one whom we address, and so prayer may be described by "setting the face toward God." The essential idea here is, that he engaged in a set and formal prayer; he engaged in earnest devotion. He evidently set apart a time for this, for he prepared himself by fasting, and by putting on sackcloth and ashes.<p>To seek by prayer and supplications - To seek his favor; to pray that he would accomplish his purposes. The words "prayer and supplications," which are often found united, would seem to denote "earnest" prayer, or prayer when mercy was implored - the notion of "mercy" or "favor" implored entering into the meaning of the Hebrew word rendered "supplications."<p>With fasting - In view of the desolations of the city and temple; the calamities that had come upon the people; their sins, etc.; and in order also that the mind might be prepared for earnest and fervent prayer. The occasion was one of great importance, and it was proper that the mind should be prepared for it by fasting. It was the purpose of Daniel to humble himself before God, and to recal the sins of the nation for which they now suffered, and fasting was an appropriate means of doing that.<p>And sackcloth - Sackcloth was a coarse kind of cloth, usually made of hair, and employed for the purpose of making sacks, bags, etc. As it was dark, and coarse, and rough, it was regarded as a proper badge of mourning and humiliation, and was worn as such usually by passing or girding it around the loins. See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>; <a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>.<p>And ashes - It was customary to cast ashes on the head in a time of great grief and sorrow. The principles on which this was done seem to have been,<p>(a) that the external appearance should correspond with the state of the mind and the heart, and<p>(b) that such external circumstances would have a tendency to produce a state of heart corresponding to them - or would produce true humiliation and repentance for sin.<p>Compare the notes at <a href="/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a>. The practical truth taught in this verse, in connection with the preceding, is, that the fact that a thing is certainly predicted, and that God means to accomplish it, is an encouragement to prayer, and will lead to prayer. We could have no encouragement to pray except in the purposes and promises of God, for we have no power ourselves to accomplish the things for which we pray, and all must depend on his will. When that will is known it is the very thing to encourage us in our approaches to him, and is all the assurance that we need to induce us to pray. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. prayer &#8230; supplications&#8212;literally, "intercessions &#8230; entreaties for mercy."

He set apart some time on purpose for this service, distinct from his usual stated times of prayer, as well as from his civil business and employment; and he not only set his face toward Jerusalem, as he used to do, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, the more to affect his mind with the desolations the city and temple lay in; but towards the Lord God, the sovereign Lord of all, who does according to his will in heaven and in earth, the Governor of the universe, the one true God, Father, Son, and Spirit: and this denotes the intenseness of his spirit in prayer; the fixedness of his heart; the ardour of his mind; the fervency of his soul; his holy confidence in God; the freedom and boldness he used in prayer, and his constancy and continuance in it; which is a principal means, and a proper manner of seeking God. The Septuagint version, agreeably to the Hebrew text (d), renders it, "to seek prayer and supplications"; such as were suitable and pertinent to the present case; most beneficial and interesting to him and his people, and most acceptable to the Lord: <p>with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes; as was usual on extraordinary occasions, in times of public mourning; and this he did, to show his sense of the divine Being, and of his own unworthiness to ask or receive anything of him; his great humiliation for the sins of the people; and to distinguish this prayer of his from ordinary ones, and to affect his own heart in it, with the sad condition his nation, city, and temple were in; and therefore abstained from food for a time, put sackcloth on his loins, and ashes on his head, or sat in them. <p>(d)      , Sept; "ad quaerendum orationem et deprecationes", Montanus; "ad quaerendam orationem et supplicationem", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I set my face unto the Lord God, to <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:</span><p>(d) He does not speak of that ordinary prayer, which he used in his house three times a day, but of a rare and vehement prayer, lest their sins should cause God to delay the time of their deliverance prophesied by Jeremiah.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">set my face</span>] i.e. directed myself: cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.">2 Chronicles 20:3</a> (lit. ‘<span class="ital">set his face</span> to seek unto Jehovah’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to</span> <span class="bld">seek prayer</span>, &c.] i.e. to apply myself to prayer, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes</span>] marks of mourning, and the usual accompaniments of supplication, penitence, and confession.

The prayer evinces great depth and fervour of religious feeling. In style it is Deuteronomic; in fact, it is composed largely of reminiscences of Deut., the prayer of Solomon in 1 Kings 8, and (especially) of Jeremiah (in particular, of Jeremiah 26, 32, 44): there are also some noticeable parallels with the prayers in Nehemiah 1, 9, and Ezra 9 (see on <span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/9-4.htm" title="And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;">Daniel 9:4</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/9-6.htm" title="Neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, which spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land....">Daniel 9:6-7</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-9.htm" title="To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;">Daniel 9:9</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/9-14.htm" title="Therefore has the LORD watched on the evil, and brought it on us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice....">Daniel 9:14-15</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-18.htm" title="O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies.">Daniel 9:18</a></span>). The most striking resemblances are, however, with parts of the confession and supplication in <a href="//apocrypha.org/baruch/1-15.htm" title="And ye shall say, To the Lord our God belongeth righteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as it is come to pass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,">Bar 1:15</a> to <a href="//apocrypha.org/baruch/3-18.htm" title="For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, and whose works are unsearchable,">Bar 3:18</a>; on which see further the Introd. p. lxxiv f.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ashes.</span> The Septuagint Version here is slavishly close; it renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> ('<span class="accented">etruria</span>) in accordance with its more common meaning, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;</span>, and the idiomatic phrase, "to seek prayer and supplication," is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. The true rendering is, as Professor Bevan points out," to set to prayer." Theodotion is nearly as slavish; only he omits "ashes," and has "fastings." The Peshitta is close, but does not follow the change of construction in the last clause. Jerome seems to have read, "my God." The cessation of the temple-worship, with its sacrifices, was naturally fitted to bring prayer as a mode of worship into a prominence it bad not before. Yet we find prayers made while the first temple was yet standing, as the prayer of Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>), of Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>). The comparison more naturally stands with the prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah<span class="cmt_word">,</span> as the subject of their supplication is similar to that of the prayer before us. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3-6</a>)<p>Therefore Nebuchadnezzar commanded the wise men of Babylon (<a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>) to be called to him, that they might interpret to him the dream. But they could not do so, although on this occasion he only asked them to give the interpretation, and not, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>, at the same time the dream itself. Instead of the Kethiv &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;, the Keri here and at <a href="/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a> gives the contracted form &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, which became possible only by the shortening of , as in &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1503; <a href="/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16</a>. The form &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; is differently explained; apparently it must be the plur. masc. instead of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1503;, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1491;, to the last, a circumlocution of the adverb at last. That &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; means posterus, and &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1503; alius, Hitzig has not yet furnished the proof. The question, wherefore Daniel came only when the Chaldean wise men could not interpret the dream, is not answered satisfactorily by the remark of Zndel, p. 16, that it was the natural course that first they should be called who by virtue of their wisdom should interpret the dream, and that then, after their wisdom had failed, Daniel should be called, who had gained for himself a name by revelations not proceeding from the class of the Magi. For if Nebuchadnezzar had still the events of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> in view, he would without doubt have called him forthwith, since it certainly did not come into his mind, in his anxiety on account of his dream, first to try the natural wisdom of his Magi. The objection offered by Hitzig, that the king does not go at once to his chief magician, v. 6 (<a href="/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>), who had already (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>) shown himself to be the best interpreter of dreams, is not thereby confuted; still less is it by the answer that the custom was not immediately to call the president of the Magi (Jahn), or that in the haste he was not at once thought of (Hv.). Though it may have been the custom not to call the chief president in every particular case, yet a dream by the king, which had filled him with terror, was an altogether unusual occurrence. If Daniel, therefore, was in this case first called only when the natural wisdom of the Magi had proved its inadequacy, the reason of this was, either that Nebuchadnezzar had forgotten what had occurred several years before (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>), and since the chief president of the wise men was only in special cases called on for counsel, therefore only the incorporated cultivators of the magician's art were called, and only when these could not accomplish that which was asked of them was the chief president Daniel required to come, - or it lay in this, that the king, afraid of receiving an unwelcome answer, purposely adopted the course indicated. Kranichfeld has decided in favour of this latter supposition. "The king," he thinks, "knew from the dream itself that the tree (v. 8 [<a href="/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11</a>]) reaching unto heaven and extending to the end of the whole earth represented a royal person ruling the earth, who could come to ruin on account of the God of the Jews, and would remain in his ruin till there was an acknowledgment of the Almighty; cf. vv. 13, 14, (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>, <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>). There was this reason for the king's keeping Daniel the Jew at a distance from this matter of the dream. Without doubt he would think himself intended by the person concerned in the dream; and since the special direction which the dream took (<a href="/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>) set forth as its natural point of departure an actual relation corresponding to that of the king to the God of Daniel, it must have occasioned to him a well-grounded fear (cf. <a href="/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a>), as in the case of Ahab, the idolater, towards Micah, the prophet of Jehovah (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>), of a severe judgment, leading him to treat with any other regarding his matter rather than with Daniel." For the establishment of this view Kranichfeld refers to the "king's subsequent address to Daniel, designed especially to appease and captivate (vv. 5, 6 [<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-8.htm">Daniel 4:8</a>, <a href="/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a>]), as well as the visibly mild and gentle deportment of the king toward the worshipper of the God of the Jews." This proceeding tending to captivate appears in the appellation, Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god; for Nebuchadnezzar, by the addition of a name of honour in commemoration of the celebrated god of the kingdom, intended to show favour toward him, as also in the expression which follows, In whom is the spirit of the holy gods, which Nebuchadnezzar repeats in the address. But neither in the one nor the other of these considerations can we perceive the intention of specially captivating and appeasing the Jew Daniel; - not in the latter of these expressions, for two reasons: 1. because Nebuchadnezzar uses the expression not merely in the address to Daniel, but also in the references to him which go before; had he designed it to captivate him, he would have used these words of honour only in the address to him; 2. because the expression, "in whom is the spirit of the holy gods," is so truly heathenish, that the Jew, who knew only one God, could not feel himself specially flattered by having the spirit of the holy gods ascribed to him.<p>If Nebuchadnezzar had had the intention of gaining the favour of Daniel, he would certainly, according to his confession (<a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>), have attributed to him the spirit of the God of gods, the Lord of lords, - a confession which even as a heathen he could utter. We cannot give the king so little credit for understanding as to suppose that he meant to show<p>(Note: Calvin here rightly remarks: non dubium est, quin hoc nomen graviter vulneraverit animum prophetae.)<p>a special favour to Daniel, who held so firmly the confession of his father's God, by reminding him that he had given him the name Belteshazzar after the name of his god Bel, whom the Jews abhorred as an idol. Thus the reminding him of this name, as well as the saying that he possessed the spirit of the holy gods, is not accounted for by supposing that he intended to appease and captivate Daniel. In showing the unsatisfactoriness of this interpretation of these expressions, we have set aside also the explanation of the reason, which is based upon it, why Daniel was called in to the king only after the Chaldean wise men; and other weighty considerations can also be adduced against it. First, the edict contains certainly nothing which can give room to the conjecture that Nebuchadnezzar entertained no true confidence, but much rather want of confidence, in him. The comparison of Nebuchadnezzar also with king Ahab in his conduct toward the prophet Micah is not suitable, because Ahab was not a mere polytheist as Nebuchadnezzar, but much rather, like Antiochus Epiphanes, persecuted the servants of Jehovah in his kingdom, and at the instigation of his heathenish wife Jezebel wished to make the worship of Baal the only religion of his kingdom. Finally, the relation of the dream does not indicate that Nebuchadnezzar, if he knew or suspected that the dream referred to himself as ruler over the whole earth, thought that he would come to ruin because of the God of the Jews. For that this does not follow from v. 14 (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>), is shown not only by the divine visitation that happened to the king, as mentioned in v. 27 (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>) in fulfilment of the dream, but also by the exhortation to the king with which Daniel closes the interpretation, "to break off sin by righteousness, and his iniquities by showing mercy to the poor" (v. 24 [v. 27]).<p>Thus there only remains this supposition, that the former revelations of God to the king had passed away from his heart and his memory; which was not surprising in the successful founder and ruler of a world-kingdom, if we consider that from twenty-five to thirty years must have passed away since Daniel interpreted to him his dream in the second year of his reign, and from ten to fifteen had passed since the miracle of the deliverance of the three from the burning fiery furnace. But if those earlier revelations of God were obscured in his heart by the fulness of his prosperity, and for ten years Daniel had no occasion to show himself to him as a revealer of divine secrets, then it is not difficult to conceive how, amid the state of disquietude into which the dream recorded in this chapter had brought him, he only gave the command to summon all the wise men of Babylon without expressly mentioning their president, so that they came to him first, and Daniel was called only when the natural wisdom of the Chaldeans had shown itself helpless.<p>The naming of Daniel by his Hebrew name in the manifesto, intended for all the people of the kingdom as well as for the Jews, is simply intended, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-29.htm">Daniel 2:29</a>, to designate the interpreter of the dream, as distinguished from the native wise men of Babylon, as a Jew, and at the same time as a worshipper of the most high God; and by the addition, "whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god," Nebuchadnezzar intends to indicate that Daniel by this name was brought into fellowship with his chief god Bel, and that not only as a worshipper of the God of the Jews, but also of the great god Bel, he had become a partaker of the spirit of the holy gods. But by the holy gods Nebuchadnezzar does not understand Jehovah, the Holy One, deriving this predicate "holy," as M. Geier says, ex theologia Isralitica, and the plur. "gods" denoting, as Calovius supposes, the mysterium pluralitatis personarum; but he speaks of the holy gods, as Jerome, Calvin, and Grotius supposed, as a heathen (ut idololatra) in a polytheistic sense. For that the revelation of supernatural secrets belonged to the gods, and that the man who had this power must possess the spirit of the gods, all the heathen acknowledged. Thus Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>) judged regarding Joseph, and thus also the Chaldeans say to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-11.htm">Daniel 2:11</a>) that only the gods could know his dream. The truth lying at the foundation of this belief was acknowledged by Joseph before Pharaoh, as also by Daniel before the Chaldean king, for both of them declared before the heathen kings that the interpretation of their dreams was not in the power of man, but could come only from God (<a href="/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>). But when in the case before us Nebuchadnezzar speaks of the holy gods, he means by the expression the &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; as opposed to the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, using the word holy of the good gods, probably from his conversation with Daniel on the subject.<p>In the address, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-6.htm">Daniel 4:6</a>, he calls Belteshazzar &#1495;&#1512;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1512;&#1489;, master of the magicians, probably from the special branch of Chaldean wisdom with which Daniel was particularly conversant, at the same time that he was chief president over all the magicians. &#1488;&#1504;&#1505;, to oppress, to compel any one, to do violence to him; here, to make trouble, difficulty. </body></html>
