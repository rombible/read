It must be our confession, the language of our convictions. Here is Daniel's humble, serious, devout address to God; in which he gives glory to him as a God to be feared, and as a God to be trusted. We should, in prayer, look both at God's greatness and his goodness, his majesty and mercy. Here is a penitent confession of sin, the cause of the troubles the people for so many years groaned under. All who would find mercy must thus confess their sins. Here is a self-abasing acknowledgment of the righteousness of God; and it is evermore the way of true penitents thus to justify God. Afflictions are sent to bring men to turn from their sins, and to understand God's truth. Here is a believing appeal to the mercy of God. It is a comfort that God has been always ready to pardon sin. It is encouraging to recollect that mercies belong to God, as it is convincing and humbling to recollect that righteousness belongs to him. There are abundant mercies in God, not only forgiveness, but forgivenesses. Here are pleaded the reproach God's people was under, and the ruins God's sanctuary was in. Sin is a reproach to any people, especially to God's people. The desolations of the sanctuary are grief to all the saints. Here is an earnest request to God to restore the poor captive Jews to their former enjoyments. O Lord, hearken and do. Not hearken and speak only, but hearken and do; do that for us which none else can do; and defer not. Here are several pleas and arguments to enforce the petitions. Do it for the Lord Christ's sake; Christ is the Lord of all. And for his sake God causes his face to shine upon sinners when they repent, and turn to him. In all our prayers this must be our plea, we must make mention of his righteousness, even of his only. The humble, fervent, believing earnestness of this prayer should ever be followed by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now, therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant - In behalf of the people. He pleaded for his people and country, and earnestly entreated the Lord to be merciful. His argument is based on the confession of sin; on the character of God; on the condition of the city and temple; on the former Divine interpositions in behalf of the people; and by all these considerations, he pleads with God to have mercy upon his people and land.<p>And cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary - Upon the temple. That is, that he would look upon it benignly and favorably. The language is common in the Scriptures, when favor and kindness are denoted by lifting up the light of the countenance, and by similar phrases. The allusion is originally, perhaps, to the sun, which, when it shines brightly, is an emblem of favor and mercy; when it is overclouded, is an emblem of wrath.<p>For the Lord's sake - That is, that he would be propitious for his own sake; to wit, that his glory might be promoted; that his excellent character might be displayed; that his mercy and compassion might be shown. All true prayer has its seat in a desire that the glory of God may be promoted, and the excellence of his character displayed. That is of more consequence than "our" welfare, and the gratification of "our" wishes, and that should be uppermost in our hearts when we approach the throne of grace. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. cause thy face to shine&#8212;metaphor from the sun, which gladdens all that it beams upon (Nu 6:25; Mal 4:2).1.

But the <span class="ital">third person</span> in the midst of a series of petitions in the second person, is very strange: it is probable, therefore, that either a letter or a word has dropped out in the Heb., and that we should read, either with Theod., Prince, <span class="ital">for thine own sake, O Lord</span> (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/9-19.htm" title="O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.">Daniel 9:19</a></span>), or with LXX, Bevan, Marti, <span class="ital">for thy servants’ sake, O Lord</span> as in the very similar appeal of <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm" title="O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear?

The omission of the <span class="accented">vav</span> in <span class="accented">tahenoonayiv</span> would occasion the LXX. rendering, "my supplications." They had read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> before, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5da;</span>. Certainly the Septuagint rendering gives better sense than the violent change to the third person from the second. Keil would escape the difficulty by translating, "because thou art the Lord" - a translation that is independent of Hebrew grammar. The conjunction would not naturally be <span class="accented">lema'an</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>), but possibly '<span class="accented">eqeb asher</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>). Further, the covenant name would certainly have been used in such a connection, and it would necessarily have been followed by "thou." As it stands, it really asserts that the desolations are on account of the Lord - an assertion which would not be germane to the tenor of the prayer. The reading of the LXX. is thus better here. Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic text, but instead of "O our God," reads, "O Lord our God," and avoids the change of person in the last clause by reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> as a vocative, and inserting <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. The Peshitta has, "our supplication," and avoids the awkward change of person by reading, "for thy Name's sake." Jerome gives a fairly accurate rendering of the Massoretic. only in the last clause he omits "Lord" and renders <span class="accented">temet ipsum.</span> The influence of the Psalter is to be seen in this verse. The first clause is a slightly altered and condensed version of <a href="/psalms/143-1.htm">Psalm 143:1</a>. The verb that ought to open the second member is omitted. The word <span class="accented">tahooneem</span> is not a very common one. <span class="accented">Cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary</span> has a close resemblance to <a href="/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3, 7, 19</a>.

To the call of the angel to "cut down the tree," etc. (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-13</a>), Daniel gives the interpretation, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a>, "This is the decree of the Most High which is come upon the king, that he shall be driven from men, and dwell among the beasts," etc. &#1506;&#1500; &#1502;&#1496;&#1488;  equals  Hebr. &#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;. The indefinite plur. form &#1496;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; stands instead of the passive, as the following &#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, cf. under <a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>. Thus the subject remains altogether indefinite, and one has neither to think on men who will drive him from their society, etc., nor of angels, of whom, perhaps, the expulsion of the king may be predicated, but scarcely the feeding on grass and being wet with dew.</body></html>
