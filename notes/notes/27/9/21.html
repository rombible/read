The Authorised Version follows the LXX. and Theodotion. The rendering has been defended on the ground that the word translated “swiftly” comes from a root meaning “to fly.” and is literally rendered by <span class= "ital">flight.</span> Thus “caused to fly in flight” means “caused to fly swiftly.” The marginal version “with weariness” finds supporters, and, if adopted, must be taken to refer to the bodily condition of Daniel (<a href="/context/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17-27</a>). The former translation is most in accordance with the context. The “flight” of angels is implied in <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.">Isaiah 6:2</a>, and should not be regarded as an idea foreign to the Old Testament.<p><span class= "bld">Touched me.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">reached me</span>.

The time of the evening sacrifice Isaiah 3 P.M., being the hour of evening prayer. (See <a href="/exodus/29-39.htm" title="The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:">Exodus 29:39</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-4.htm" title="The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at even;">Numbers 28:4</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:20-27 An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses 24-27, one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer - How "long" the prayer continued we are not informed. It is probable that we have only the substance of it, and that Daniel has recorded only the topics on which he dwelt more at length. The subject was of great importance, and it is reasonable to suppose that a day had been devoted to an examination of the prophecies, and to solemn prayer.<p>Even the man Gabriel - Who had the appearance of a man, and hence, so called.<p>Whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning - That is, in a "former" vision. See the notes at <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>. It cannot refer to what is mentioned in this (the ninth) chapter, for<p>(a) he had as yet had no vision, but all that is recorded is a prayer;<p>(b) there is no intimation that Gabriel had appeared to him at the beginning of the prayer; and<p>(c) it is declared that at the beginning of the prayer, Gabriel, then evidently in heaven, had received commandment to go to Daniel, and to communicate the message to him, <a href="/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>.<p>The meaning undoubtedly is, that the personage who now appeared to him he recognized to be the same who had appeared in a former vision on the banks of the Ulai. The proper meaning of the Hebrew here is, "in a vision at the beginning," as in our translation. So the Vulgate, "a principio;" and so Theodotion - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;  en te&#772; arche&#772;. The Hebrew word &#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;  tech&#305;&#770;lla&#770;h means, properly, "beginning," <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; but, in connection with the preposition, as here - &#1489;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;  battech&#305;&#770;lla&#770;h - it means also, "before, formerly," <a href="/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-21.htm">Genesis 41:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/43-18.htm">Genesis 43:18</a>, <a href="/genesis/43-20.htm">Genesis 43:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>.<p>Being caused to fly swiftly - Margin, "with weariness," or "flight." On the difficult Hebrew expression here - &#1489;&#1497;&#1506;&#1507; &#1502;&#1506;&#1507;  mu&#8219;a&#770;p b&#305;&#770;y&#8219;a&#770;p - Lengerke may be consulted, in loc. The words, according to Gesenius, are derived from &#1497;&#1506;&#1507;  ya&#770;&#8219;ap, to go swiftly, and then, to be wearied, to faint, either with running, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>, or with severe labor, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>, or with sorrows, <a href="/isaiah/50-4.htm">Isaiah 50:4</a>. If derived from this word, the meaning in Hophal, the form used here, would be, "wearied with swift running," and the sense is, that Gabriel had borne the message swiftly to him, and appeared before him as one does who is wearied with a rapid course. If this be the idea, there is no direct allusion to his "flying," but the reference is to the rapidity with which he had come on the long journey, as if exhausted by his journey. The Latin Vulgate renders it cito volans - quickly flying; Theodotion, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  petomenos - flying; the Codex Chisianus, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  tachei pheromenos - "borne swiftly." The Syriac, "with a swift flying he flew and came from heaven." It cannot be determined with certainty, from the words used here, that the coming of Gabriel was by an act of "flying" as with wings. The common representation of the angels in the Old Testament is not with wings, though the cherubim and Seraphim (<a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>, following.) are represented with wings; and in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>, we have a representation of an angel flying. Probably the more exact idea here is that of a rapid course, so as to produce weariness, or such as would naturally produce fatigue.<p>Touched me - Daniel was doubtless at this time engaged in prayer.<p>About the time of the evening oblation - The evening sacrifice. This was at the ninth hour of the day, or about three o'clock in the afternoon. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

As formerly, when the temple stood, this hour was devoted to sacrifices, so now to prayer.

The first word may be derived equally from two different verbs, meaning respectively <span class="ital">to fly</span> and <span class="ital">to be weary</span>; the second word, as it stands, could only be derived naturally from the latter verb: thus we get the two renderings, <span class="bld">being made to fly in weariness</span> (i.e. being exhausted by his flight), and (Ges., Keil, Meinh.) <span class="bld">being made weary in weariness</span> (cf.

With vv. 17 (<a href="/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20</a>) and 18 (<a href="/daniel/4-21.htm">Daniel 4:21</a>) cf. vv. 8 (<a href="/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11</a>) and 9 (<a href="/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a>). The fuller description of the tree is subordinated to the relative clause, which thou hast seen, so that the subject is connected by &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (<a href="/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>), representing the verb. subst., according to rule, with the predicate &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1488;. The interpretation of the separate statements regarding the tree is also subordinated in the relative clauses to the subject. For the Kethiv &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;  equals  &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;, the Keri gives the shortened form &#1512;&#1489;&#1514;, with the elision of the third radical, analogous to the shortening of the following &#1502;&#1496;&#1514; for &#1502;&#1496;&#1514;. To the call of the angel to "cut down the tree," etc. (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-13</a>), Daniel gives the interpretation, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a>, "This is the decree of the Most High which is come upon the king, that he shall be driven from men, and dwell among the beasts," etc. &#1506;&#1500; &#1502;&#1496;&#1488;  equals  Hebr. &#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;. The indefinite plur. form &#1496;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; stands instead of the passive, as the following &#1500;&#1498; &#1497;&#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1502;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, cf. under <a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>. Thus the subject remains altogether indefinite, and one has neither to think on men who will drive him from their society, etc., nor of angels, of whom, perhaps, the expulsion of the king may be predicated, but scarcely the feeding on grass and being wet with dew.</body></html>
