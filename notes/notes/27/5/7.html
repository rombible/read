Mr. Bruce (vol. 4. p. 32) speaks of a person who was suddenly advanced to a command, the third in the kingdom of Abyssinia for rank, power, and riches; and that, at his public investiture, he had a circle of gold put upon his head, was clothed with a white and blue mantle, and made the king’s lieutenant-general in the provinces allotted to him.” — Wintle.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 Belshazzar bade defiance to the judgments of God. Most historians consider that Cyrus then besieged Babylon. Security and sensuality are sad proofs of approaching ruin. That mirth is sinful indeed, which profanes sacred things; and what are many of the songs used at modern feasts better than the praises sung by the heathens to their gods! See how God struck terror upon Belshazzar and his lords. God's written word is enough to put the proudest, boldest sinner in a fright. What we see of God, the part of the hand that writes in the book of the creatures, and in the book of the Scriptures, should fill us with awful thoughts concerning that part which we do not see. If this be the finger of God, what is his arm when made bare? And what is He? The king's guilty conscience told him that he had no reason to expect any good news from heaven. God can, in a moment, make the heart of the stoutest sinner to tremble; and there needs no more than to let loose his own thoughts upon him; they will give him trouble enough. No bodily pain can equal the inward agony which sometimes seizes the sinner in the midst of mirth, carnal pleasures, and worldly pomp. Sometimes terrors cause a man to flee to Christ for pardon and peace; but many cry out for fear of wrath, who are not humbled for their sins, and who seek relief by lying vanities. The ignorance and uncertainty concerning the Holy Scriptures, shown by many who call themselves wise, only tend to drive sinners to despair, as the ignorance of these wise men did.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the king cried aloud - Margin, as in the Chaldee, "with might." This indicates a sudden and an alarming cry. The king was deeply terrified; and, unable himself to divine the meaning of the mysterious appearance of the hand, he naturally turned at once to those whose office it was to explain dreams and supernatural appearances.<p>To bring in the astrologers ... - See the note at <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-7.htm">Daniel 4:7</a>.<p>And said to the wise men of Babylon - Those just referred to - the astrologers, etc. Having the power, as was supposed, of interpreting the indications of coming events, they were esteemed as eminently wise.<p>Whosoever shall read this writing - It would seem from this that even the characters were not familiar to the king and to those who were with him. Evidently the letters were not in the ordinary Chaldee form, but in some form which to them was strange and unknown. Thus there was a double mystery hanging over the writing - a mystery in regard to the language in which the words were written, and to the meaning of the words. Many conjectures have been formed as to the language employed in this writing (compare the note at <a href="/daniel/5-24.htm">Daniel 5:24</a>), but such conjectures are useless, since it is impossible now to ascertain what it was. As the writing, however, had a primary reference to the sacrilege committed in regard to the sacred vessels of the temple, and as Daniel was able to read the letters at once, it would seem not improbable that the words were in the Hebrew character then used - a character such as that found now in the Samaritan Pentateuch - for the Chaldee character now found in the Bible has not improbably been substituted for the more ancient and less elegant character now found in the Samaritan Pentateuch alone. There is no improbability in supposing that even the astrologers and the soothsayers were not familiar with that character, and could not readily read it.<p>And show me the interpretation thereof - The meaning of the words.<p>Shall be clothed with scarlet - The color worn usually by princes and by persons of rank. The margin is "purple." So the Greek of Theodotion - &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  porphuran. So also the Latin Vulgate - "purpura." On the nature and uses of this color, see the note at <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>.<p>And have a chain of gold about his neck - Also indicative of rank and authority. Compare <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>. When Joseph was placed over the land of Egypt, the king honored him in a similar manner, by putting "a gold chain about his neck." This was common in Persia. See Xen. "Cyrop." I. 3, 2, II. 4, 6, VIII. 5, 18; Anab. I. 5, 8. Upon most of the figures in the ruins of Persepolis the same ornament is now found. Prof. Stuart renders this, "a collar of gold."<p>And shall be the third ruler in the kingdom - Of course, the king was first. Who the second was, or why the one who could disclose the meaning of the words should not be raised to the second rank, is not stated. It may be, that the office of prime minister was so fixed, or was held by one whose services were so important to the king, that he could not be at once displaced. Or the meaning may be, that the favored person who could interpret this would be raised to the third "rank" of dignity, or placed in the third class of those who held offices in the realm. The Chaldee is, "and shall rule third in the kingdom," and the idea would seem rather to be that he should be of the third rank or grade in office. So Bertholdt understands it. Grotius understands it as the third person in rank. He says the first was the king; the second, the son of the king; the third, the prince of the Satraps. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. He calls for the magicians, who more than once had been detected in imposture. He neglects God, and Daniel, whose fame as an interpreter was then well-established. The world wishes to be deceived and shuts its eyes against the light [Calvin].

Hence the literal rendering appears to be, ‘shall rule <span class="ital">as a third part</span> in the kingdom,’ i.e. have a third part of the supreme authority in the country, be one of the three chief ministers, ‘rule as one of three.’ Cf. LXX. <span class="greekheb">δοθήσεται αὐτῷ ἐξουσία τοῦ τρίτου μέρους τῆς βασιλείας</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom</span>. The Septuagint here also differs from the Massoretic text, "And the king cried out with a great cry to call in the enchanters (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c2;</span>) and sorcerers (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), and Chaldeans, and soothsayers, to announce to him the interpretation of the writing, and they came in for inspection (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), to see the writing, And they were not able to make known to the king the interpretation of the writing. Then the king made commandment, saying, Any man who shall show the interpretation of the writing, he shall put on him a purple robe, and shall put round his neck a golden chain, and authority shall be given him over a third part of the kingdom." Theodotion is an exact rendering of the Massoretic text in the sense represented by the English versions, save that it wholly omits the conjunctions between the various classes of wise men, so that <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> might be an adjective qualifying either <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, and the article is also omitted, which is represented in the Massoretic text by the <span class="accented">status emphaticus.</span> The Peshitta has  four classes of wise men called in; as the Septuagint has, otherwise it agrees with the Massoretic text. It is a matter of some interest to observe that the position of the Chaldeans is somewhat precarious here, as in the second chapter. They disappear wholly from the list in the next verse, which really seems to be another version of this. It is a marginal gloss that has crept into the text. If we accept the reading of the Septuagint here, so far at least as to assume the entrance of the wise men before the king's declaration of the reward, the succession of events becomes more natural. The king calls for the presence of these interpreters of omens, and then, when they fail to interpret the writing to him, he proclaims his offer of a reward to whoever can do so. It is to be noted that there is in the Septuagint no question of ability to read the writing, but simply to interpret it. It has been pointed out to me by a friend that if these words were written in cuneiform, the signs that would represent them might have a great variety of possible sounds, and with these differing sounds, differing meanings. Sometimes a sign was phonetic and a syllable, sometimes it was idiographic and might represent a whole word. There is this to be said for this view - the Assyrian was the writing expected in inscriptions. Still, from the fact that the Septuagint omits the demand that the inscription should be read, we may regard the matter as doubtful. Assuming that the wise men were required to read the inscription, some of the Jewish interpreters, as Jephet-ibn-Ali, think that the letters of the word were inverted; others have it that the letters were arranged in columns. Even, however, if the words were written correctly enough as Aramaic words, it would be a difficult matter to put any meaning in them as they stood, as we shall see when we consider Daniel's interpretation. The reward promised is of special interest. The word <span class="accented">argvana</span>, translated "scarlet," appears in Assyrian as <span class="accented">argmamm</span>; <span class="accented">hamneeka</span>, the word rendered "necklace," is of doubtful origin. We find in the Ninevite sculptures and on the cylinders from Babylon many instances of splendid robes (<span class="accented">vide</span> Rawlinson, 'Five Great Monarchies,' 560); the rich necklace is also to be seen (ibid., 2. 497,499). The great difficulty has arisen over the rank given to Daniel, "the third ruler in the kingdom." The difficulty is that the ordinal here is not in its usual form, although Petermann gives <span class="accented">taltu</span> as one of the forms of the ordinal. There is, further, the unusual position of the numeral in relation to the verb, though the abnormality is less than Professor Bevan represents it, as the Peshitta follows word for word the arrangement of the Massoretic text. The truth seems to be that the word really was <span class="accented">toolta</span>, as in the Syriac, and the difficulty has risen in not recognizing the transference from one dialect of Aramaic to another. It is used in the Peshitta (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a>) of the third heaven. Professor Bevan's interpretation, that it means "<span class="accented">every</span> third day,') may be dismissed as absurd. Ewald (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) regards the title as one of a board of three - not an in,possible meaning, in the light of what we find in the following chapter. Yet his reasoning, that it cannot be third in rank, because the queen-mother could not be counted in, is inept now, when we learn that Belshazzar was colleague with his father, and so the third place was all he had to give. On this question Behrmann takes the view discarded as impossible by Ewald, and holds that Daniel was placed third because of the queen-mother. It is one of the commonplaces of the criticism of this book that the history ascribed to Daniel is borrowed from the history of Joseph: why was the position offered not made "second," as was that of Joseph? We have the reason in what we know of the history of Babylon at the time. The Septuagint and Josephus were unaware of the facts, and translated as they did. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Size, Gates, and Name of the City<p>To complete the whole picture of the future land of Israel, what has been stated in <a href="/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a> concerning the size of the holy city is still further expanded here. - <a href="/ezekiel/48-30.htm">Ezekiel 48:30</a>.

To the west side, four thousand five hundred - their gates three; the gate of Gad one, the gate of Asher one, the gate of Naphtali one. <a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>. Round about, eighteen thousand (rods); and the name of the city: from henceforth Jehovah there. - The situation of the city of God within the terumah and its external dimensions have already been generally indicated in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/48-16.htm">Ezekiel 48:16</a>. Here the measurement of the several sides is specified with a notice of their gates, and this is preceded by the heading, "the outlets of the city." &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, the outgoings (not extensions, for the word never has this meaning) as the furthest extremities in which a city or a tract of land terminates; not outlets or gates, which are expressly distinguished from them, but outgoing sides; hence the definition of the extent or length of the several sides is appended immediately afterwards. The enumeration commences, as above in the case of the land, with the north side. Each side has three gates, so that the whole city has twelve, which bear the names of the twelve tribes, like the gates of the heavenly Jerusalem in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>, because it will be the city of the true people of God. Levi is included here, and consequently Ephraim and Manasseh are united in the one tribe of Joseph. The three sons of Leah commence the series with the northern gates. They also stand first in the blessing of Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6-8</a> : the first-born in age, the first-born by virtue of the patriarchal blessing, and the one chosen by Jehovah for His own service in the place of the first-born. Then follow, for the eastern gates, the two sons of Rachel, according to their age (thus deviating from <a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>), and, along with them, the elder son of Rachel's maid; for the southern gates, the three other sons of Leah; and lastly, for the western gates, the three other sons of the maids. Being thus indicated by the names of its gates as the city of all Israel, the city itself receives a name, which exalts it into the city of God (Jehovah). But different explanations have been given of the words in <a href="/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a> which refer to this name. The allusion in &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; and the meaning of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; are both disputed points. It is true that the latter literally means "thither;" but Ezekiel also uses it as synonymous with &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "there," in <a href="/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-29.htm">Ezekiel 32:29-30</a>, so that the assertion that &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; never means "there" is incorrect. &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, from day forward, equivalent to henceforward; but not henceforth and for ever, though this may be implied in the context. Whether &#1502;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; be taken in connection with the preceding words, "the name of the city will henceforward be," or with those which follow, the name of the city will be, "henceforward Jehovah there," makes no material difference so far as the thought is concerned, as the city can only bear the name from the time when Jehovah is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, and can only bear it so long as Jehovah is &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. But so far as the question is concerned, whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; signifies thither or there in this passage, Hvernick is of opinion, indeed, that the whole of Ezekiel's vision does not harmonize with the meaning "there," inasmuch as he separates temple and city, so that Jehovah does not properly dwell in Jerusalem, but, in the strictest an highest sense, in His sanctuary, and turns thence to Jerusalem with the fulness of His grace and love. But if Jehovah does not merely direct His love toward the city from afar off, but, as Hvernick still further says, turns it fully toward it, causes His good pleasure to rest upon it, then He also rules and is in the city with His love, so that it can bear the name "Jehovah thither (there)." In any case, the interpretation, "Jehovah will from henceforth proceed thither, to restore it, to make it a holy city" (Kliefoth), is untenable; for the name is not given to Jerusalem when lying waste, but to the city already restored and fully built, which Ezekiel sees in the spirit. He has therefore before this turned His favour once more to Jerusalem, which was laid waste; and the name &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, given to the new Jerusalem, can only affirm that henceforward it is to be a city of Jehovah, i.e., that from this time forth Jehovah will be and rule in her. The rendering "Jehovah thither" does not answer to this, but only the rendering, "Jehovah will be there." compare <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/60-14.htm">Isaiah 60:14</a>, where Jerusalem is called the city of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One in Israel, because the glory of Jehovah has risen over her as a brilliant light. </body></html>
