Hence it has been conjectured that the second <span class= "ital">Mene</span> was originally <span class= "ital">Madai,</span> or Media. This, though it appears plausible, has no external support. The word <span class= "ital">Mene,</span> “numbered,” is repeated twice for the sake of emphasis. The days of Babylon are numbered; it is God Himself who has numbered them. “Mene” is used in the double sense of “numbering” and “bringing to an end.” Similarly, “Tekel” implies both the act of “weighing” and the fact of “being light.” The “<span class= "ital">u”</span> in <span class= "ital">Upharsin</span> is the conjunction “and,” while <span class= "ital">pharsin,</span> or, rather, <span class= "ital">parsin,</span> is the plural of <span class= "ital">peres,</span> a noun which implies “divisions” and also Persians. It appears from <a href="/daniel/5-28.htm" title="PERES; Your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.">Daniel 5:28</a> that the divided empire of Babylon and the Medo-Persian empire are signified.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:18-31 Daniel reads Belshazzar's doom. He had not taken warning by the judgments upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he had insulted God. Sinners are pleased with gods that neither see, nor hear, nor know; but they will be judged by One to whom all things are open. Daniel reads the sentence written on the wall. All this may well be applied to the doom of every sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished; after death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance, and found wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder, and given as a prey to the devil and his angels. While these things were passing in the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrus entered the city; and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submission followed. Soon will every impenitent sinner find the writing of God's word brought to pass upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance of the law as a self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as a painted hypocrite.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And this is the writing that was written - The Babylonians, it would seem, were unacquainted with the "characters" that were used, and of course unable to understand the meaning. See <a href="/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a>. The first thing, therefore, for Daniel to do was to read the writing, and this he was able to do without difficulty, probably, as already remarked, because it was in the ancient Hebrew character - a character quite familiar to him, though not known to the Babylonians, whom Belshazzar consulted. It is every way probable that that character "would" be used on an occasion like this, for<p>(a) it is manifest that it was intended that the true God, the God of the Hebrews, should be made known, and this was the character in which his communications had been made to men;<p>(b) it was clearly the design to honor his own religion, and it is morally certain that there would be something which would show the connection between this occurrence and his own agency, and nothing would do this better than to make use of such a character; and<p>(c) it was the Divine intention to put honor on Daniel, and this would be well done by making use of a character which he understood.<p>There have been, indeed, many conjectures respecting the characters which were employed on this occasion, and the reasons of the difficulty of interpreting the words used, but it is most probable that the above is the true statement, and this will relieve all the difficulties in regard to the account. Prideaux supposes that the characters employed were the ancient Phoenician characters, that were used by the Hebrews, and that are found now in the Samaritan Pentateuch; and that, as above suggested, these might be unknown to the Babylonians, though familiar to Daniel. Others have supposed that the characters were those in common use in Babylon, and that the reason why the Babylonians could not read them was, that they were smitten with a sudden blindness, like the inhabitants of Sodom, <a href="/genesis/19-11.htm">Genesis 19:11</a>. The Talmudists suppose that the words were written in a cabalistic manner, in which certain letters were used to stand for other letters, on the principle referred to by Buxtorf ("Lex. Chal. Rabb. et Talm." p. 248), and known as &#1488;&#1514;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;  'a&#770;thebbash - that is, where the alphabet is reversed, and the Hebrew letter &#1488;  (a) is used for the Hebrew letter &#1514;  (T), and the Hebrew letter &#1489;  (B) for the Hebrew letter &#1513;  (S), etc., and that on account of this cabalistic transmutation the Babylonians could not read it, though Daniel might have been familiar with that mode of writing. rabbi Jochanan supposed that there was a change of the order in which the letters of the words were written; other rabbis, that there was a change merely in the order of the first and second letters; others, that the words were written backward; others that the words were written, not in the usual horizontal manner, but perpendicularly; and others, that the words were not written in full, but that only the first letters of each were written. See Bertholdt, pp. 349, 350. All these are mere conjectures, and most of them are childish and improbable suppositions. There is no real difficulty in the case if we suppose that the words were written in a character familiar to Daniel, but not familiar to the Babylonians. Or, if this is not admitted, then we may suppose that some mere marks were employed whose signification was made known to Daniel in a miraculous manner. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

The true explanation of the four words is probably that which was first suggested by Clermont-Ganneau[260], and which has since been adopted by Nöldeke and others. They are really the names of three <span class="ital">weights, měnê</span> being the correct Aramaic form of the Hebrew <span class="ital">mâneh</span>, the <span class="ital">m’na</span> (<span class="greekheb">μνᾶ</span>), <span class="ital">těḳêl</span> being the Aramaic form of the Hebrew <span class="ital">sheḳel</span>, and <span class="ital">pĕrês</span> (or more correctly <span class="ital">pěrâs</span>), properly <span class="ital">division</span>, being a late Jewish word for a half-m’na. Thus the four words are really a m’na, a m’na, a shekel, and half-m’nas. The puzzle consisted partly in the character or manner in which they were supposed to have been written—an unfamiliar form of the Aramaic character, for instance, or, as the mediaeval Jews suggested, a vertical instead of a horizontal arrangement of the letters; partly in the difficulty of attaching any meaning to them, even when they were read: what could the names of three weights signify?[261] Here Daniel’s skill in the ‘declaring of riddles’ (<span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/5-12.htm" title="For as much as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.">Daniel 5:12</a></span>) comes in. <span class="ital">Měnê</span> itself means ‘numbered,’ as well as ‘a m’na’: it is accordingly interpreted at once as signifying that the days of Belshazzar’s kingdom are ‘numbered,’ and approaching their end. <span class="ital">Těḳêl</span>, ‘<span class="ital">shekel</span>,’ suggests <span class="ital">těḳîl</span>, ‘weighed’: ‘Thou art <span class="ital">weighed</span> in the balances, and art found wanting.’ <span class="ital">Parsin</span>, ‘half-m’nas,’ or <span class="ital">pěrês</span> (<span class="ital">pěrâs</span>), ‘a half-shekel,’ points allusively to a double interpretation: ‘Thy kingdom is <span class="ital">divided</span> (<span class="ital">pěrîs</span>)[262], and given to the Medes and <span class="ital">Persians</span>’ (Aramaic <span class="ital">pâras</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[260] <span class="ital">Journal Asiatique</span>, Juillet-Août, 1886, p. 36 ff.

This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians</span>. The Septuagint has two versions of this passage, one m the text, the other in the portion at the beginning, which we think is really composed of marginal readings. In the text the Aramaic is not given at all. As we have already seen, the verse which corresponds to ver. 25 here is really the latter part of ver. 17 of the Septuagint, "This is the writing: It hath been numbered; it is reckoned; it has been carried away." In the verses which are appended to the beginning of the chapter, we have the Aramaic words, but given in a different order, and without the repetition of the first word: "MANE, PHARES, THEKEL. MANE, It has been numbered; PHARES, It is carried away; TnEKEL, It has been set up." Here not only is the order different, but the meaning assigned to <span class="accented">phares</span> is singular. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> means in Syriac, "spread out." It would seem that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> meant "stretched out" as well as "carried away." It is still more difficult to understand how <span class="accented">thekel </span>can mean "set up," unless the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1ff7;</span>, "on the balance," are understood. The Septuagint of the best version is briefer than the Massoretic, though less so than it is in some of the other passages, "Numbered is the time of thy kingdom; ceases thy kingdom; cut short and ended has been thy kingdom; to the Modes and the Persians has it been given." The word interpreted is not repeated as in the Massoretic text, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, which in some of the conjugations means "destroyed," whereas in ver. 17 it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "it is reckoned," a rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e7;&#x5dc;</span> which makes it mean "weigh." The Septuagint rendering of the first clause is an evident attempt at explaining the numbering implied. The Massoretic reading involves a pun in both the last words; there is a play between <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">teqel</span>), "to weigh," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">qelal</span>), "to be light," although the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5d7;</span> rather conceals this. In the last the play is between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e1;</span>, "to divide," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d3;&#x5e1;</span>, "a Persian." Theodotion avoids the repetition of the first word, otherwise he is in somewhat close agreement with the Massoretic text, "MANE, God hath measured thy kingdom; THEKEL, It is set on the balance, and found wanting; PHARES, Thy kingdom is cut asunder, and given to the Medes and the Persians." The Peshitta is in close agreement with the Massoretic  text. The actual meaning of the words, taking them as they appear in the Massoretictext, as Aramaic words, is, to give English equivalents, "a pound, a pound, an ounce, and quarters;" hence the impossibility of interpreting the words. We find all these words, <span class="accented">mena</span>, <span class="accented">teqel</span> (shekel), <span class="accented">pares</span>, in the Ninevite inscriptions. As the words are interpreted, we cannot fail to be impressed with the peremptory style of the inscription, as Hitzig has it. Zockler refers to the sculpturesque style (<span class="accented">lapidarstil</span>). This brevity rendered it difficult for the soothsayers to put any meaning into the words at all. In all the versions the fact that the kingdom is to be given to the Medes and Persians <span class="cmt_word">is</span> emphasized, but, moreover, the play on words in the last clause implies the Persians as the prominent assailants of the Babylonian power, but really that the two powers were united. It seems extraordinary that any one, in the face of this, should maintain that the author of Daniel separated the two powers, and thought the Median power succeeded the Babylonian, and then that the Persian succeeded the Median. We know now that Herodotus's representation of the history of Media and Persia is utterly false and misleading. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Daniel knew from the answer of the chief that he would grant the request if he were only free from personal responsibility in the matter, he turned himself to the officer who was under the chief chamberlain, whom they were immediately subject to, and entreated him to make trial for ten days, permitting them to use vegetables and water instead of the costly provision and the wine furnished by the king, and to deal further with them according as the result would be. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1510;&#1512;, having the article, is to be regarded as an appellative, expressing the business of the calling of the man.
