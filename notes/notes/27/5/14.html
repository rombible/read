Many consult servants of God on curious questions, or to explain difficult subjects, but without asking the way of salvation, or the path of duty. Daniel slighted the offer of reward. He spoke to Belshazzar as to a condemned criminal. We should despise all the gifts and rewards this world can give, did we see, as we may by faith, its end hastening on; but let us do our duty in the world, and do it all the real service we can.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have even heard of thee ... - <a href="/daniel/5-11.htm">Daniel 5:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the captivity of Judah&#8212;the captive Jews residing in Babylon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I have even heard of thee,....

The man so named was the chief marshal of the court of Nebuchadnezzar. &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489; (the word &#1512;&#1489; used for &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>, belongs to the later usage of the language, cf. <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>) means chief commander of the eunuchs, i.e., overseer of the srail, the Kislar Aga, and then in a wider sense minister of the royal palace, chief of all the officers; since &#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505; frequently, with a departure from its fundamental meaning, designates only a courtier, chamberlain, attendant on the king, as in <a href="/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>. The meaning of &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, more definitely determined by the context, is to lead, i.e., into the land of Shinar, to Babylon. In &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, Israel is the theocratic name of the chosen people, and is not to be explained, as Hitz. does, as meaning that Benjamin and Levi, and many belonging to other tribes, yet formed part of the kingdom of Judah. &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503; ...  &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, as well of the seed ... as also. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is the Zend. frathema, Sanscr. prathama, i.e., persons of distinction, magnates. &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, the object to &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, designates youths of from fifteen to twenty years of age.

In choosing the young men, the master of the eunuchs was commanded to have regard to bodily perfection and beauty as well as to mental endowments.
