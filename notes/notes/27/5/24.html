MENE; <span class="ital">God hath numbered thy kingdom,</span> &c. — God hath numbered the days of thy reign, and put an end to it. The word MENE is doubled in the foregoing verse, to show that the thing was certain, and established by God, as Joseph tells Pharaoh in a like case, <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm" title="And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.">Genesis 41:32</a>.

He had not taken warning by the judgments upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he had insulted God. Sinners are pleased with gods that neither see, nor hear, nor know; but they will be judged by One to whom all things are open. Daniel reads the sentence written on the wall. All this may well be applied to the doom of every sinner. At death, the sinner's days are numbered and finished; after death is the judgment, when he will be weighed in the balance, and found wanting; and after judgment the sinner will be cut asunder, and given as a prey to the devil and his angels. While these things were passing in the palace, it is considered that the army of Cyrus entered the city; and when Belshazzar was slain, a general submission followed. Soon will every impenitent sinner find the writing of God's word brought to pass upon him, whether he is weighed in the balance of the law as a self-righteous Pharisee, or in that of the gospel as a painted hypocrite.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then was the part of the hand sent from him - To wit, the fingers. See <a href="/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>. The sense is, that when it was fully perceived that Belshazzar was not disposed to learn that there was a God in heaven; when he refused to profit by the solemn dispensations which had occurred in respect to his predecessor; when his own heart was lifted up with pride, and when he had gone even farther than his predecessors had done by the sacrilegious use of the vessels of the temple, thus showing special contempt for the God of heaven, then appeared the mysterious handwriting on the wall. It was then an appropriate time for the Most High God, who had been thus contemned and insulted, to come forth and rebuke the proud and impious monarch. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

As we have seen, the real equivalent of this verse in the Septuagint is a clause in ver. 17, "And the hand which had written (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) stood." If we take this to mean that the band now "<span class="accented">ceased</span> to write," then the original text might be <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, the verb being written <span class="accented">fleaum</span>, in Mandaean manner. Then it would easily  happen that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;</span> (in the older script  and ) was resolved into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> (in the older script  and ). In support of this, it may be observed that while in the fifth verse the older construction of construct state and <span class="accented">status emphalicus</span> is used to exhibit the genitival connection, in the present case the relative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> is used as a sign of the genitive. Starting with this, it is easy to see how the Massoretic text arose; but, on the other hand, it is difficult to see the sense of the reading of the Septuagint, unless this fiery hand is to be imagined as tracing and retracing the characters on the wall of the palace, and that the hand only ceased when Daniel stood before the inscription to read. Thec-dotion differs very little from the Massoretic text, and the Peshitta coincides with it. The word for "writing," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">resheem</span>), is really "engraving," and therefore peculiarly descriptive of the Assyrian mode of impressing on clay tablets or incising in stone the thing to be preserved. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Daniel knew from the answer of the chief that he would grant the request if he were only free from personal responsibility in the matter, he turned himself to the officer who was under the chief chamberlain, whom they were immediately subject to, and entreated him to make trial for ten days, permitting them to use vegetables and water instead of the costly provision and the wine furnished by the king, and to deal further with them according as the result would be. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1510;&#1512;, having the article, is to be regarded as an appellative, expressing the business of the calling of the man.

Ten, in the decimal system the number of completeness or conclusion, may, according to circumstances, mean a long time or only a proportionally short time. Here it is used in the latter sense, because ten days are sufficient to show the effect of the kind of food on the appearance. &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, food from the vegetable kingdom, vegetables, leguminous fruit. <a href="/daniel/1-13.htm">Daniel 1:13</a>. &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is singular, and is used with &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; in the plural because two subjects follow. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as thou shalt see, viz., our appearance, i.e., as thou shalt then find it, act accordingly.

The confidence of living faith which hopes in the presence and help of God is fundamentally different from the eager expectation of miraculous interference of a Maccabean Jew, which C. v. Lengerke and other deists and atheists wish to find here in Daniel.)<p>The youths throve so visibly on the vegetables and water, that the steward relieved them wholly from the necessity of eating from the royal table. <a href="/daniel/1-15.htm">Daniel 1:15</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;, fat, well nourished in flesh, is grammatically united to the suffix of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, from which the pronoun is easily supplied in thought. <a href="/daniel/1-16.htm">Daniel 1:16</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, took away  equals  no more gave. </body></html>
