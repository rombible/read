We know not the uneasiness of many who live in great pomp, and, as others vainly think, in pleasure also. The king said that his learned men must tell him the dream itself, or they should all be put to death as deceivers. Men are more eager to ask as to future events, than to learn the way of salvation or the path of duty; yet foreknowledge of future events increases anxiety and trouble.

That is, they were so to state the dream that Nebuchadnezzar would recognize it; and they were to give such an explanation of it as would commend itself to his mind as the true one. On this last point he would doubtless rely much on their supposed wisdom in performing this duty, but it would seem clear, also, that it was necessary that the interpretation should be seen to be a "fair" interpretation, or such as would be "fairly" implied in the dream. Thus, when Daniel made known the interpretation, he saw at once that it met all the features of the dream, and he admitted it to be correct. So also when Daniel explained the handwriting on the wall to Belshazzar, he admitted the justness of it, and loaded him with honors, <a href="/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>. So when Joseph explained the dreams of Pharaoh, he at once saw the appropriateness of the explanation, and admitted it to be correct <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-45</a>; and so in the case above referred to (notes on <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), of Astyages respecting the dreams of his daughter (Herod. 1, cvii.; cviii.), he at once saw that the interpretation of the dreams proposed by the Magi accorded with the dreams, and took his measures accordingly.<p>Ye shall receive of me gifts, and rewards, and great honor - Intending to appeal to their highest hopes to induce them, if possible, to disclose the meaning of the dream. He specifics no particular rewards, but makes the promise general; and the evident meaning is, that, in such a case, he would bestow what it became a monarch like him to give. That the usual rewards in such a case were such as were adapted to stimulate to the most vigorous exertions of their powers, may be seen from the honor which he conferred on Daniel when he made known the dream <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>, and from the rewards which Belshazzar conferred on Daniel for making known the interpretation of the writing on the wall <a href="/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a> : "Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."

The Septuagint Version is "If ye will show me the dream, and tell me its interpretation, ye shall receive every sort (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of gifts, and be honoured by me: show me the dream, and judge." There are indications of differences in the text, which are considered below. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic in its rendering of this verse. The Peshitta also manifests no serious difference. All these older ver<span class="accented">sions</span> render it doubtful whether <span class="accented">nebizba</span> was part of the original text. <span class="accented">But if ye show the dream</span>, <span class="accented">and the interpretation thereof</span>, <span class="accented">ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards a</span>n<span class="accented">d great honour.</span> Ewald would conjoin with this verse the latter part of the verse preceding, with considerable justification. Like the latter part of the previous verse, it is to be taken as the summation of a long argument, in which threats and promises would bear a large part, probably both heightening as they failed to produce tire effect required of making the soothsayers reproduce to Nebuchadnezzar his dream. Now the acme is reached - on the one hand, a death of torture and infamy is threatened; on the other band, in the verse before us, "gifts, rewards, and great honour." The king is eager to have his dream interpreted, but he has taken his stand - before he will listen to the interpretation, they must afford him evidence that they can interpret correctly this dream, by reproducing it to him. One of the words here has been used by Berthohlt as evidence that the Book of Daniel originated in the days of the Maccabees, when Greek was largely spoken. The word translated "<span class="accented">reward"</span> in our version is <span class="accented">nebizba</span>; this, it was argued by Bertholdt, is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">m</span> becoming <span class="accented">b</span> - a not infrequent commutation. In support of this, if we take <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> as meaning "coined money," this would make a distinction between this word and <span class="accented">matnan</span>, the more ordinary word for "a <span class="accented">girt."</span> Jephet-ibn-Ali translates in accordance with this meaning: "I will give you raiment and dinars," he makes Nebuchadnezzar say. Yet this view is now abandoned by all critics, and however many alleged Greek words are found in Daniel, this is never now brought forward as one of them. Lexicographers are practically unanimous in rejecting this derivation. There are two other derivations, one making it a palpel form of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;</span> with a <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> pre-formative which was Gesenius's view in his 'Thesaurus.' He later abandoned this view, and maintained that it was connected with some Persian root. Winer maintains the former of these views, and Furst the latter. As a Persian word, it  is supposed to prove the late date of Daniel. It does seem somewhat strange logic to argue, from the presence of Persian words in a document, that therefore it was written late in the Greek period. The prior question presents itself - Is the word Persian, Greek, or Aramaic, really a part of the original text of Daniel? In regard to this the Septuagint Version is of importance. Its rendering of this clause is, as we have seen, "But if ye shall show me the dream, and tell me the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive all manner of gifts, and shall be honoured by me." This interpretation implies a different text - the word <span class="accented">nebizba</span> disappears from the text altogether, for no one would translate it <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>; evidently the translator had before him some combination of <span class="accented">col</span>, "all." The combination <span class="accented">matnan nebizba</span> occurs in the Targum in <a href="/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, therefore, had it been present, the translator would have been aware of its meaning. Theodotion renders it <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>. If the phrase occurred elsewhere, there would easily be a motive to introduce the word <span class="accented">nebizba</span>, but there seems none to substitute for it another word altogether; certainly <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> are not unfrequently confounded, and a defective <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> might be read as a <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>. It would not be difficult to reproduce a Hebrew sentence, the rendering of which would require <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>. This much is clear <span class="accented">- nebizba</span> was not before the Septuagint translator. It is further to be observed that the Septuagint translator has had before him, not the noun <span class="accented">yeqar</span>, "honour," but the verb in the passive or ethpael. These, however, are not all the points where the Septuagintal text must have differed from the text we have received from the Massoretes. The adjective <span class="accented">sagi</span>," great," occurs in the Authorized Version, but is not represented in the Septuagint. The order of the Greek words suggests a different order in the original Aramaic. Other things being equal, the strutter a reading, the more likely it is to be the original reading. It is clear that this advantage is with the Septuagint reading. If there were any likelihood of certain words being omitted from any probable cause as homoioteleuton, it would be different. On the other hand, the addition of a kind which is frequently seen, the more recent word <span class="accented">nebizba</span> is put alongside its more ancient equivalents. In the other case, the adjective <span class="accented">sagi</span>, "great," is inserted, as frequently happens, with a view of heightening the effect. Another explanation may be suggested. We know the Aramaic docquets on the back of the contract tablets are written in a script resembling Phoenician characters. If the original manuscripts were written at the date assigned by tradition, then it would be written in this style of letter. In it we find that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> were liable to be mistaken, as also; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span>; we should then have <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> (<span class="accented">minni</span>), "from <span class="accented">me</span>," as a possible reading which had been rot,read by some Palestinian scribe into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">sagi</span>), "<span class="accented">great</span>," and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> added to complete the word. The case is only a familiar case of doublets. When we have further <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;</span>, "from me," the change of the preceding is thus in a sense necessitated. This may be regarded as an indication of age, as the square character had begun at least a century before Christ (Driver,' Samuel,' p. 21.). This leaves but little time for modifications and blunders of penmanship between this and the critical date of Daniel. The latter clause of this verse shows us another variation between the Massoretic text and that lying behind the Septuagint. The Massoretic recension is well represented in the Authorized Version. <span class="accented">Therefore show me the dream</span>, <span class="accented">and the interpretation thereof.</span> The version of the Septuagint indicates a different reading, and has a different point, "Declare to me the dream, and judge." According to the Massoretic reading, the king merely repeats his demands, the only reference to the preceding promises and threatenings being in the conjunction <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lahen</span>), "therefore." Whereas the main reference of the clause, according to the Septuagint, is to the immediately preceding promises, "Show me the dream, and judge if I will do as I have said." Another supposition possible is that there has been a transposition. In the very next verse <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hevah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> represented by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> - in that case it may mean "interpret," the rendering then would be, "Show me the dream and interpret," and represent some part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span>, only there is the awkwardness of using the same word as equivalent to two different Aramaic words in contiguous verses. The difference is not of great importance; the king is eager to get the magicians to tell him his dream and its interpretation, but, having commenced the experiment as to their powers, he will not allow himself to be driven from it. Before leaving this verse, we must note the presence of certain signs of old date in the Aramaic of the passage. First, the word <span class="accented">hen</span>, "if," is not used in the Targums; it is not in Levy's Dictionary; neither Gesenius nor Furst gives any non-Biblical reference for the use of the word In the same way, its derivative <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lahen</span>), "therefore," is equally peculiar to Biblical Aramaic.  Particles are good notes of age, as they are less liable to change than nouns substantive. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Heave-offerings of the People. - <a href="/ezekiel/45-13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>.

There is no express mention made of wine for the drink-offering, or of cattle, which were also requisite for the burnt-offering and peace-offering, in addition to animals from the flock. The enumeration therefore is not complete, but simply contains the rule according to which they were to act in levying what was required for the sacrifices.

The article in &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, as in &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514; ni sa ,&#1492;&#1506;&#1501; ni  in <a href="/ezekiel/45-14.htm">Ezekiel 45:14</a>. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;, to be, i.e., to belong, to anything - in other words, to be held to it, under obligation to do it; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;  (<a href="/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>), on the other hand, to be upon a person, i.e., to devolve upon him. In &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497; the feast and days of festival, which have been previously mentioned separately, are all grouped together. '&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;' .rehtegot, to furnish the sin-offering, etc., i.e., to supply the materials for them.<p>So far as the fact is concerned, the Mosaic law makes no mention of any contributions to the sanctuary, with the exception of the first-born, the first-fruits and the tithes, which could be redeemed with money, however. Besides these, it was only on extraordinary occasions - e.g., the building of the tabernacle - that the people were called upon for freewill heave-offerings. But the Mosaic law contains no regulation as to the sources from which the priests were to meet the demands for the festal sacrifices. So far, the instructions in the verses before us are new. What had formerly been given for this object as a gift of spontaneous love, is to become in the future a regular and established duty, to guard against that arbitrary and fitful feeling from which the worship of God might suffer injury. - To these instructions there are appended, from <a href="/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a> onwards, the regulations concerning the sacrifices to be offered at the different festivals. </body></html>
