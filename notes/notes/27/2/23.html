He continues to be faithful to His promises to Israel by blessing Daniel’s education in secular subjects, and finally by the dream.

Praying friends are valuable friends; and it well becomes the greatest and best men to desire the prayers of others. Let us show that we value our friends, and their prayers. They were particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, we can expect nothing but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leave in prayer to tell our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, the peril they were in. The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, was bestowed. The fervent prayers of righteous men avail much. Daniel was thankful to God for making known that to him, which saved the lives of himself and his fellows. How much more should we be thankful to God, for making known the great salvation of the soul to those who are not among the worldly wise and prudent!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers - By his "fathers" here, Daniel refers doubtless to the Jewish people in general, and not to his own particular ancestors. The meaning of the phrase "God of my fathers" is, that he had been their protector; had regarded them as his people; had conferred on them great favors. The particular ground of thanksgiving here is, that the same God who had so often revealed himself to the Hebrew people by the prophets in their own land, had now condescended to do the same thing to one of their nation, though a captive in a strange country. The favor thus bestowed had an increased value, from the fact that it showed that the Hebrew people were not forgotten, though far from the land of their birth, and that, though in captivity, they might still hope for the benign interposition of God.<p>Who hast given me wisdom and might - The word "wisdom" here undoubtedly refers to the ability which had now been given him to declare the nature and purport of the dream, imparting to him a degree of wisdom far superior to those pretenders to whom the matter had been at first submitted. The word "might" (Chaldee, strength - &#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1488;  gebu&#770;retha&#770;') does not probably differ materially from "wisdom." It means "ability" to interpret the dream - implying that it was a task beyond natural human ability.<p>For thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter - That is, it had been made known to him and his friends. He joins himself with them, for, although it was particularly made known to him, yet, as they had united with him in prayer that the secret might be disclosed, and as they shared common dangers, he regarded it as in fact made known to them all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. thee &#8230; thee&#8212;He ascribes all the glory to God.<p>God of my fathers&#8212;Thou hast shown Thyself the same God of grace to me, a captive exile, as Thou didst to Israel of old and this on account of the covenant made with our "fathers" (Lu 1:54, 55; compare Ps 106:45).<p>given me wisdom and might&#8212;Thou being the fountain of both; referring to Da 2:20.

There seems a slight difference of reading implied here. Theodotion and the Peshitta are practically at one with the Massoretic. Theodotion translates the relative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as if it were "and," not, as in our version, "for;" and the Peshitta repeats the first personal pronoun. Daniel now particularizes his reasons for praise and thanksgiving. He addresses God as the God of his fathers. He appeals to him as the covenant God of Israel, who had led their fathers through the wilderness. God revealed himself to Jacob at Bethel as "the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac." So to Moses at the burning bush he declared himself "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God. of Jacob." On the other hand, when Jacob approached God in prayer, he addressed him as "the God of my father Abraham, and the God of my father Isaac." God had shown kindness to his fathers: would he not also show kindness to their seed after them? <span class="accented">Who hast given me wisdom and might.</span> As <span class="accented">Jacob</span> in his prayer at Mahanaim (<a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9</a>) not only pleads with God as the God of his fathers, but also as the God who had blessed him with his guidance before, so Daniel now further addresses God who had bestowed upon him "wisdom and might." When God has bestowed upon any one special faculties, he must presumably have a special work for him, rid it is therefore reasonable to plead with God to give an opportunity for the exercise of these special powers. Here it forms an occasion of thanksgiving. We are apt to forget that our powers, mental and physical, our <span class="accented">possessions</span> and acquirements, are gifts of God's grace for which we owe thanks. The special reason for gratitude, however, follows - God has answered the prayer of his servants. <span class="accented">Hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee.</span> It is to be noted that Daniel attributes the answer not merely to his own prayer, but to the united prayer of his three friends as well. Their earnest desire had gone along with his own in calling down the Divine answer. Daniel, while giving thanks for the knowledge vouchsafed to him, recognizes the help his friends had afforded. <span class="accented">For</span> <span class="accented">thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</span> Daniel assigns the reason here for his thanksgiving  yet more definitely. God had made known to him what the king had required. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sacrifices for the Sabbath and New Moon<p>As, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>, it devolved upon the prince to provide and bring the sacrifices for himself and the house of Israel; after the appointment of the sacrifices to be offered at the yearly feasts (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18-25</a>), and before the regulation of the sacrifices for the Sabbath and new moon (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4-7</a>), directions are given as to the conduct of the prince at the offering of these sacrifices (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-3</a>). For although the slaughtering and preparation of the sacrifices for the altar devolved upon the priests, the prince was to be present at the offering of the sacrifices to be provided by him, whereas the people were under no obligation to appear before the Lord in the temple except at the yearly feasts.<p><a href="/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>.

And the prince shall come by the way to the porch of the gate from without, and stand at the posts of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship on the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut till the evening. <a href="/ezekiel/46-3.htm">Ezekiel 46:3</a>.

And the burnt-offering which the prince shall offer to Jehovah shall consist on the Sabbath-day of six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; <a href="/ezekiel/46-5.htm">Ezekiel 46:5</a>. And as a meat-offering, an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs as a meat-offering that which his hand may give, and of oil a hin to the ephah (of meal). <a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a>. And on the day of the new moon there shall be an bullock, a young ox without blemish, and six lambs and a ram without blemish; <a href="/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>. And he shall put an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram for the meat-offering, and for the lambs as much as his hand affords, and of oil a hin for the ephah. - <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-3</a> supply and explain the instructions given in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a> concerning the outer eastern gate. As the east gate of the outer court (<a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>), so also the east gate of the inner court was to remain closed during the six working days, and only to be opened on the Sabbaths and new moons, when it was to remain open till the evening. The prince was to enter this inner east gate, and to stand there and worship upon the threshold while his sacrifice was being prepared and offered. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is to be taken as in <a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>; but &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, which is appended, is not to be referred to the entrance into the inner court, as the statement would be quite superfluous so far as this is concerned, since any one who was not already in the inner court must enter the gate-building of the inner court from without, or from the outer court. The meaning of &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is rather that the prince was to enter, or to go to, the gate porch of the inner court through the outer east gate. There he was to stand at the posts of the gate and worship on the threshold of the gate during the sacrificial ceremony; and when this was over he was to go out again, namely, by the same way by which he entered (<a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>). But the people who came to the temple on the Sabbaths and new moons were to worship &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, i.e., at the entrance of this gate, outside the threshold of the gate. Kliefoth in wrong in taking &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; in the sense of through the doorway, as signifying that the people were to remain in front of the outer east gate, and to worship looking at the temple through this gate and through the open gate between.

There is no force in the consideration which has led Kliefoth to overlook &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, and think of the outer gate, namely, that "it would be unnatural to suppose that the people were to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, whilst the outer east gate remained shut (or perhaps more correctly, was opened for the prince), and so stand in front of the inner court," as it is impossible to see what there is that is unnatural in such a supposition. On the other hand, it is unnatural to assume that the people, who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a>, were to come through the north and south gates into the outer court at all the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; to appear before Jehovah, were not allowed to enter the court upon the Sabbaths and new moons if they should wish to worship before Jehovah upon these days also, but were to stand outside before the gate of the outer court. The difference between the princes and the people, with regard to visiting the temple upon the Sabbaths and new moons, consisted chiefly in this, that the prince could enter by the outer east gate and proceed as far as the posts of the middle gate, and there worship upon the threshold of the gate, whereas the people were only allowed to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, and could only proceed to the front of the middle gate. - <a href="/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4</a>. The burnt-offering for the Sabbath is considerably increased when compared with that appointed in the Mosaic law. The law requires two yearling lambs with the corresponding meat-offering (<a href="/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>); Ezekiel, six lambs and one ram, and in addition to these a meat-offering for the ram according to the proportion already laid down in <a href="/ezekiel/45-24.htm">Ezekiel 45:24</a> for the festal sacrifices; and for the lambs, &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, a gift, a present of his hand, - that is to say, not a handful of meal, but, according to the formula used in alternation with it in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>, as much as his hand can afford. For &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; , see <a href="/leviticus/14-30.htm">Leviticus 14:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-26.htm">Leviticus 25:26</a>. - It is different with the sacrifices of the new moon in <a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>. The law of Moses prescribed two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, with the corresponding meat-offering, and a he-goat for a sin-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>); the thorah of Ezekiel, on the contrary, omits the sin-offering, and reduces the burnt-offering to one bullock, one ram, and six lambs, together with a meat-offering, according to the proportion already mentioned, which is peculiar to his law. The first &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a> is a copyist's error for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
