Praying friends are valuable friends; and it well becomes the greatest and best men to desire the prayers of others. Let us show that we value our friends, and their prayers. They were particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, we can expect nothing but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leave in prayer to tell our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, the peril they were in. The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, was bestowed. The fervent prayers of righteous men avail much. Daniel was thankful to God for making known that to him, which saved the lives of himself and his fellows. How much more should we be thankful to God, for making known the great salvation of the soul to those who are not among the worldly wise and prudent!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he changeth the times and the seasons - The object of this is to assert the general control of God in reference to all changes which occur. The assertion is made, undoubtedly, in view of the revolutions in empire which Daniel now saw, from the signification of the dream, were to take place under the Divine hand. Foreseeing now these vast changes denoted by different parts of the image <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36-45</a>, stretching into far-distant times, Daniel was led to ascribe to God the control over "all" the revolutions which occur on earth. There is no essential difference between the words "times" and "seasons." The words in Chaldee denote stated or appointed seasons; and the idea of times "appointed, set, determined," enters into both. Times and seasons are not under the control of chance, but are bounded by established laws; and yet God, who appointed these laws, has power to change them, and all the changes which occur under those laws are produced by his agency. Thus the changes which occur in regard to day and night, spring and summer, autumn and winter, clouds and sunshine, health and sickness, childhood and youth, manhood and age, are under his control. Such changes, being in accordance with certain laws, may be regarded as "appointed," or "set," and yet the laws and the revolutions consequent on them are all under his control. So in regard to the revolutions of empire. By the arrangements of his providence he secures such revolutions as he shall see it to be best should occur, and in all of them his high hand should be regarded. The words "seasons" and "times" are of frequent occurrence in Daniel, and are sometimes used in a peculiar sense (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>), but they seem here to be employed in their usual and general signification, to denote that "all" the revolutions which occur on earth are under his control.<p>He removeth kings, and setteth up kings - He has absolute control over all the sovereigns of the earth, to place on the throne whom he will, and to remove them when he pleases. This was doubtless suggested to Daniel, and was made the foundation of this portion of his hymn of praise, from what he was permitted to see in the disclosures made to him in the interpretation of the dream. He then saw (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-45</a>) that there would be most important revolutions of kingdoms under the hand of God, and being deeply impressed with these great prospective changes, he makes this general statement, that it was the prerogative of God to do this at pleasure. Nebuchadnezzar was brought to feel this, and to recognize it, when he said <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>, "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will;" "he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?"<p><a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32</a>, <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>. This claim is often asserted for God in the Scriptures as a proof of his supremacy and greatness. "For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: but God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another," <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a>. Thus he claimed absolute control over Sennacherib to employ him at his pleasure in executing his purposes of punishment on the Hebrew nation <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>, and thus over Cyrus to execute his purposes on Babylon, and to restore his people to their land, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, following See also <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10-11</a>. In this manner, all the kings of the earth may be regarded as under his control; and if the Divine plan were fully understood it would be found that each one has received his appointment under the Divine direction, to accomplish some important part in carrying forward the Divine plans to their fulfillment. A history of human affairs, showing the exact purpose of God in regard to each ruler who has occupied a throne, and the exact object which God designed to accomplish by placing "him" on the throne at the time when he did, would be a far more important and valuable history than any which has been written. Of many such rulers, like Cyrus, Sennacherib, Pilate, Henry VIII, Edward VI, and the Elector of Saxony, we can see the reason why they lived and reigned when they did; and doubtless God has had some important end to accomplish in the development of his great plans in the case of every one who has ever occupied a throne.<p>He giveth wisdom unto the wise ... - He is the source of all true wisdom and knowledge. This is often claimed for God in the Scriptures. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6-7</a> :<p>"For the Lord giveth wisdom;<p>Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.<p>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous;<p>He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly."<p>See also <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>; <a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>. God claims to be the source of all wisdom and knowledge. He originally formed each human intellect, and made it what it is; he opens before it the paths of knowledge; he gives to it clearness of perception; he preserves its powers so that they do not become deranged; he has power to make suggestions, to direct the laws of association, to fix the mind on important thoughts, and to open before it new and interesting views of truth. And as it would be found, if the history could be written, that God has placed each monarch on the throne with a distinct reference to some important purpose in the development of his great plans, so probably it would be seen that each important work of genius which has been written; each invention in the arts; and each discovery in science has been, for a similar purpose, under his control. He has created the great intellect just at the time when it was needful that such a discovery or invention should be made, and having prepared the world for it by the course of events, the discovery or invention has occurred just at the time when, on the whole, it was most desirable that it should. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. changeth &#8230; times &#8230; seasons&#8212;"He herein gives a general preparatory intimation, that the dream of Nebuchadnezzar is concerning the changes and successions of kingdoms" [Jerome]. The "times" are the phases and periods of duration of empires (compare Da 7:25; 1Ch 12:32; 29:30); the "seasons" the fitting times for their culmination, decline, and fall (Ec 3:1; Ac 1:7; 1Th 5:1). The vicissitudes of states, with their times and seasons, are not regulated by chance or fate, as the heathen thought, but by God.<p>removed kings&#8212;(Job 12:18; Ps 75:6, 7; Jer 27:5; compare 1Sa 2:7, 8).<p>giveth wisdom&#8212;(1Ki 3:9-12; Jas 1:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God made time; God made the sun, moon, and stars, the measure of time; he made the day and the night, and seasons of the year, yea, the revolutions and change of times; he can make bad times better, and turn night into day. He can make the sun go backward or stand still, as in Ahaz’s and Joshua’s time; it is the great part of God’s power and prerogative to change times. Daniel here attributes that to God which heathens attributed to nature, which they deified, or to chance; seeing that God only, that made all by his power, doth rule, and sometimes overrule all by his providence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he changeth the times and the season,.... Not only of day and night, summer and winter, and times and seasons of prosperity and adversity; but all the changes and revolutions in states and kingdoms, in all times and ages, are from him; and particularly those pointed at in the following dream, in the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman monarchies: <p>he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he is King of kings, and Lord of lords; by him they reign, and continue on their thrones, as long as he pleases; and then he removes them by death or otherwise, and places others in their stead; and who are sometimes raised from a low estate; and this he does in the ordinary course of Providence; see <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6</a> and particularly Daniel might have in view the removal of the Babylonian monarchs, and setting up kings of the race of the Medes and Persians; and then the degrading them, and advancing the Grecians to the height of monarchy; and then reducing of them, and raising the Romans to a greater degree of power and authority; and at last crushing them all in their turns, to make way for the kingdom of his Son: <p>he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: an increase of wisdom and knowledge, to wise politicians and counsellors of state, to form wise schemes of peace or war, to make wise laws, and govern kingdoms in a prudent manner; and to wise master builders or ministers of the word, to speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, to diffuse the knowledge of Christ everywhere, and make known the mysteries of grace to the sons of men; particularly to Daniel and his companions, who were wise and knowing men, the interpretation of the king's dream. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">the times and the seasons</span>] more exactly <span class="bld">seasons and times</span>; cf. <a href="/daniel/7-12.htm" title="As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.">Daniel 7:12</a>; <a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1 Thessalonians 5:1</a>.

In regard to this verse, Theodotion and the Septuagint only differ in this from the Massoretic text, that they omit the repetition of the word "kings." The Peshitta has a different sense in the middle clause. "He maketh (Peshitta, <span class="accented">ma'bed</span>) kings and confirmeth (Peshitta, <span class="accented">maqeem</span>) kings" The Syriac translators have evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">meh</span> '<span class="accented">deh</span>), "to remove," as <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">meha'bed</span>), "<span class="accented">to</span> make" The utter want of contrast in this reading condemns it. In regard to the Aramaic of this passage, the carrying on of the preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>, the sign of the haphel conjugation, is a proof of the early date of the Aramaic. In later Aramaic, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> gives place to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> disappears after the other preformative as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. <span class="accented">Changeth times and seasons.</span> Nebuchadnezzar was anxious lest the time in which he might make advantageous use of the information conveyed by the dream should pass away, and a new "time" be established. Not improbably Nebuchadnezzar, like most heathens, imagined that his gods were limited by some unseen power like the Greek Fate, and, however wishful they might be to be propitious to their worshippers only in certain collocations of the heavenly bodies could they carry out their wish. God, the God of heaven, the God of the despised Hebrews, he it was who arranged the times and the seasons, he made the sun to rise, he makes summer and winter, he leads out the host of the stars, alike the star of Nebo and the star of Marduk. The two words "time" and "season" are nearly synonymous. Perhaps the first is more indefinite than the other. Our own opinion is that the first has more the idea of space of time, and the latter more of point of time; but really they are almost synonymous. <span class="accented">He removeth kings</span>, <span class="accented">and setteth up kings.</span> In this there seems to be a special reference to the contents of the vision, which showed that in the time to come, not only kings but dynasties were to be set up and overthrown. The former clause regarded God as the God of nature. This looks u pen him as the God of providence, by whom "kings reign, and princes decree justice." <span class="accented">He giveth wisdom unto the wise</span>, <span class="accented">and knowledge to them that know understand-lag.</span> This address to God goes further. Daniel sees in the faculties and mental acquirements of men the manifestation of God. It is the inspiration of the Almighty that giveth understanding. All the power man has of acquiring knowledge, all the faculty he has for using that knowledge aright, all come from God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sacrifices for the Sabbath and New Moon<p>As, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>, it devolved upon the prince to provide and bring the sacrifices for himself and the house of Israel; after the appointment of the sacrifices to be offered at the yearly feasts (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18-25</a>), and before the regulation of the sacrifices for the Sabbath and new moon (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4-7</a>), directions are given as to the conduct of the prince at the offering of these sacrifices (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-3</a>). For although the slaughtering and preparation of the sacrifices for the altar devolved upon the priests, the prince was to be present at the offering of the sacrifices to be provided by him, whereas the people were under no obligation to appear before the Lord in the temple except at the yearly feasts.<p><a href="/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>.

The prince was to enter this inner east gate, and to stand there and worship upon the threshold while his sacrifice was being prepared and offered. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is to be taken as in <a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>; but &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, which is appended, is not to be referred to the entrance into the inner court, as the statement would be quite superfluous so far as this is concerned, since any one who was not already in the inner court must enter the gate-building of the inner court from without, or from the outer court. The meaning of &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is rather that the prince was to enter, or to go to, the gate porch of the inner court through the outer east gate. There he was to stand at the posts of the gate and worship on the threshold of the gate during the sacrificial ceremony; and when this was over he was to go out again, namely, by the same way by which he entered (<a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>). But the people who came to the temple on the Sabbaths and new moons were to worship &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, i.e., at the entrance of this gate, outside the threshold of the gate. Kliefoth in wrong in taking &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; in the sense of through the doorway, as signifying that the people were to remain in front of the outer east gate, and to worship looking at the temple through this gate and through the open gate between.

There is no force in the consideration which has led Kliefoth to overlook &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, and think of the outer gate, namely, that "it would be unnatural to suppose that the people were to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, whilst the outer east gate remained shut (or perhaps more correctly, was opened for the prince), and so stand in front of the inner court," as it is impossible to see what there is that is unnatural in such a supposition. On the other hand, it is unnatural to assume that the people, who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a>, were to come through the north and south gates into the outer court at all the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; to appear before Jehovah, were not allowed to enter the court upon the Sabbaths and new moons if they should wish to worship before Jehovah upon these days also, but were to stand outside before the gate of the outer court. The difference between the princes and the people, with regard to visiting the temple upon the Sabbaths and new moons, consisted chiefly in this, that the prince could enter by the outer east gate and proceed as far as the posts of the middle gate, and there worship upon the threshold of the gate, whereas the people were only allowed to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, and could only proceed to the front of the middle gate. - <a href="/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4</a>. The burnt-offering for the Sabbath is considerably increased when compared with that appointed in the Mosaic law. The law requires two yearling lambs with the corresponding meat-offering (<a href="/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>); Ezekiel, six lambs and one ram, and in addition to these a meat-offering for the ram according to the proportion already laid down in <a href="/ezekiel/45-24.htm">Ezekiel 45:24</a> for the festal sacrifices; and for the lambs, &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, a gift, a present of his hand, - that is to say, not a handful of meal, but, according to the formula used in alternation with it in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>, as much as his hand can afford. For &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; , see <a href="/leviticus/14-30.htm">Leviticus 14:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-26.htm">Leviticus 25:26</a>. - It is different with the sacrifices of the new moon in <a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>. The law of Moses prescribed two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, with the corresponding meat-offering, and a he-goat for a sin-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>); the thorah of Ezekiel, on the contrary, omits the sin-offering, and reduces the burnt-offering to one bullock, one ram, and six lambs, together with a meat-offering, according to the proportion already mentioned, which is peculiar to his law. The first &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a> is a copyist's error for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
