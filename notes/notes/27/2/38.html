The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heavens, hath he given into thy hand - This is evidently general language, and is not to be pressed literally. It is designed to say that he ruled over the whole world; that is, the world as then known. This is common language applied in the Scriptures to the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman kingdoms. Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-39.htm">Daniel 2:39</a>, the third of these kingdoms, the Grecian, was to "bear rule over all the earth." Compare <a href="/daniel/8-5.htm">Daniel 8:5</a> : "And, as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth." So of the Roman empire, in <a href="/daniel/7-23.htm">Daniel 7:23</a> : "The fourth beast shall devour the whole earth." The declaration that his kingdom embraced the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air is a strong expression, meaning that he reigned over the whole world. A somewhat similar description of the extent of the empire of the king of Babylon occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-4.htm">Jeremiah 27:4-8</a> : "And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say unto your masters; I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power, and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me. And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field I have given him also to serve him. And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him. And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."<p>At the time referred to by Daniel, the scepter of Nebuchadnezzar a extended over all these realms, and the world was, in fact, placed substantially under one head. "All the ancient Eastern histories," says Bishop Newton, "almost are lost; but there are some fragments even of pagan historians yet preserved, which speak of this mighty conqueror and his extended empire. Berosus, in Josephus (Contra Apion, c. i. Section 19), says that he held in subjection Egypt, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, and by his exploits surpassed all the Chaldeans and Babylonians who reigned before him. Strabo asserts that this king among the Chaldeans was more celebrated than Hercules; that he proceeded as far as to the pillars of Hercules, and led his army out of Spain into Thrace and Pontus. But his empire, though of great extent, was not of long duration, for it ended in his grandson Belshazzar, not seventy years after the delivery of this prophecy, nor above twenty-three years after the death of Nebuchadnezzar." - Newton on the "Prophecies," pp. 186, 187.<p>Thou art this head of gold - The head of gold seen in the image represents thee as the sovereign of a vast empire. Compared with the other monarchs who are to succeed thee, thou art like gold compared with silver, and brass, and iron; or, compared with thy kingdom, theirs shall be as silver, brass, and iron compared with gold. It was common, at an early period, to speak of different ages of the world as resembling different metals. Compare the notes at <a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>. In reference to the expression before us, "Thou art this head of gold," it should be observed, that it is not probably to be confined to the monarch himself, but is rather spoken of him as the head of the empire; as representing the state; as an impersonation of that dynasty. The meaning is, that the Babylonian empire, as it existed under him, in its relation to the kingdoms which should succeed, was like the head of gold seen in the image as compared with the inferior metals that made up the remaining portions of the image. Daniel, as an interpreter, did not state in what the resemblance consisted, nor in what respects his empire could be likened to gold as compared with those which should follow. In the scanty details which we now have of the life of that monarch, and of the events of his reign, it may not be possible to see as clearly as would be desirable in what that resemblance consisted, or the full propriety of the appellation given to him. So far as may now be seen, the resemblance appears to have been in the following things:<p>(I) In respect to the empire itself of which he was the sovereign, as standing at the head of the others - the first in the line. This was not indeed the first kingdom, but the design here was not to give an account of all the empires on earth, but to take the world "as it was then," and to trace the successive changes which would occur preparatory to the establishment of the kingdom which should finally spread over the earth. Viewed in reference to this design, it was undoubtedly proper to designate the empire of Babylon "as the head." It not only stood before them in the order of time, but in such a relation that the others might be regarded as in some sort its successors; that is, "they would succeed it in swaying a general scepter over the world." In this respect they would resemble also the Babylonian. At the time here referred to, the dominion over which Nebuchadnezzar swayed his scepter was at the head of the nations; was the central power of the Pagan world; was the only empire that could claim to be universal. For a long period the kingdom of Babylon had been dependent on that of Assyria; and while Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian empire, Babylon was the head of a kingdom, in general subordinate to that of Assyria, until Nabopolassar, the immediate predecessor of Nebuchadnezzar, rendered the kingdom of Babylon independent of the Assyrians, and transferred the seat of empire to Babylon. This was about the year 626 before the Christian era. See "Universal History," vol. iii. pp. 412-415. Nebuchadnezzar, receiving this mighty kingdom, had carried his own arms to distant lands; had conquered India, Tyre, and Egypt; and, as would appear, all Northern Africa, as far as the pillars of Hercules, and, with quite unimportant exceptions, all the known world was subject to him.<p>(II) The appellation "head of gold" may have been given him on account of the splendor of his capital, and the magnificence of his court. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, Babylon is called "the golden city." See the note at that place. In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>, it is called "the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency." In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a>, it is called "the lady of kingdoms." In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>, it is spoken of as "abundant in treasures," and in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-41.htm">Jeremiah 51:41</a>, as "the praise of the whole earth." So in profane writers, Babylon has similar appellations. Thus, in Aesch. Per. 51, mention is made of &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7; &#787; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Babulo&#772;n he&#772; poluchrusos - "Babylon abounding in gold." The conquests of Nebuchadnezzar enabled him to bring to his capital the spoils of nations, and to enrich his capital above any other city on the earth. Accordingly, he gave himself to the work of adorning a city that should be worthy to be the head of universal empire, and succeeded in making it so splendid as to be regarded as one of the wonders of the world. His great work in adorning and strengthening his capital consisted, first, of the building of the immense walls of the city; second, of the tower of Belus; and third, of the hanging gardens. For a full description of these, see Prideaux's "Connections," vol. i. p. 232, following.<p>(III) The appellation may have been given him by comparison with the kingdoms which were to succeed him. In some respects - in extent and power - some one or more of them, as the Roman, might surpass his; but the appellation which was appropriate to them was not gold, but they would be best denoted by the inferior metals. Thus the Medo-Persian kingdom was less splendid than that of Babylon, and would be better represented by silver; the Macedonian, though more distinguished by its conquests, was less magnificent, and would be better represented by brass; and the Roman, though ultimately still more extensive in its conquests, and still more mighty in power, was less remarkable for splendor than strength, and would be better represented by iron. In magnificence, if not in power, the Babylonian surpassed them all; and hence, the propriety of the appellation, "head of gold."<p>(IV) It is possible that in this appellation there then may have been some reference to the character of the monarch himself. In <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>, he is spoken of as the "servant of God," and it is clear that it was designed that a splendid mission was to be accomplished by him as under the Divine control, and in the preparation of the world for the coming of the Messiah. Though he was proud and haughty as a monarch, yet his own personal character would compare favorably with that of many who succeeded him in these advancing kingdoms. Though his conquests were numerous, yet his career as a conqueror was not marked with cruelty, like that of many other warriors. He was not a mere conqueror. He loved also the arts of peace. He sought to embellish his capital, and to make it in outward magnificence and in the talent which he concentrated there, truly the capital of the world. Even Jerusalem he did not utterly destroy; but having secured a conquest over it, and removed from it what he desired should embellish his own capital, he still intended that it should be the subordinate head of an important province of his dominions, and placed on the throne one who was closely allied to the king who reigned there when he took the city.<p>But the appellation here, and the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, are to be contemplated chiefly, like the kingdoms that succeeded, in their relation to redemption. It is in this aspect that the study of history becomes most interesting to a mind that regards all events as embraced in the eternal counsels of God, and it is undoubtedly with reference to this that the history of these kingdoms becomes in any way introduced into the inspired writings. All history may be contemplated under two aspects: in its secular bearing; and in its relation to the redemption of the world. In the former aspect, it has great and important uses. As furnishing lessons to statesmen; as showing the progress of society; as illustrating the effects of vice and immorality, and the evils of anarchy, ambition, and war; as recording and preserving the inventions in the arts, and as showing what are the best methods of civil government, and what conduces most to the happiness of a people, its value cannot well be overestimated.<p>But it is in its relations to the work of redeeming man that it acquires its chief value, and hence, the sacred volume is so much occupied with the histories of early nations. The rise and fall of every nation; the conquests and defeats which have occurred in past times, may all have had, and perhaps may yet be seen to have had, an important connection with the redemption of man - as being designed to put the world in a proper position for the coming of the Prince of Peace, or in some way to prepare the way for the final triumph of the gospel. This view gives a new and important aspect to history. It becomes an object in which all on earth who love the race and desire its redemption, and all in heaven, feel a deep concern. Every monarch; every warrior; every statesman; every man who, by his eloquence, bravery, or virtue, has contributed anything to the progress of the race, or who has in any way played an important part in the progress of the world's affairs, becomes a being on whom we can look with intense emotion; and in reference to every man of this character, it would be an interesting inquiry what he has done that has contributed to prepare the way for the introduction of the Mediatorial scheme, or to facilitate its progress through the world. In reference to this point, the monarch whose character is now before us seems to have been raised up, under an overruling Providence, to accomplish the following things:<p>(1) To inflict "punishment" on the revolted people of God for their numerous idolatries. See the book of Jeremiah, "passim." Hence, he led his armies to the land of Palestine; he swept away the people, and bore them into captivity; he burned the temple, destroyed the capital, and laid the land waste.<p>(2) He was the instrument, in the hand of God, of effectually purifying the Jewish nation from the sin of idolatry. It was for that sin eminently that they were carried away; and never in this world have the ends of punishment been better secured than in this instance. The chastisement was effectual. The Jewish nation has never since sunk into idolatry. If there have been individuals of that nation - of which, however, there is no certain evidence - who have become idolaters, yet as a people they have been preserved from it. More than two thousand five hundred years have since passed away; they have been wanderers and exiles in all lands; they have been persecuted, ridiculed, and oppressed on account of their religion; they have been placed under every possible inducement to conform to the religion around them, and yet, as professed worshippers of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, they have maintained their integrity, and neither promises nor threatenings, neither hopes nor fears, neither life nor death, have been sufficient to constrain the Hebrew people to bow the knee to an idol god.<p>(3) another object that seems to have been designed to be accomplished by Nebuchadnezzar in relation to Redemption was to gather the nations under one head preparatory to the coming of the Messiah. It will be seen in the remarks which will be made on the relation of the Roman empire to this work (see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40-43</a>), that there were important reasons why this should be done. Preparatory to that, a succession of such kingdoms each swayed the scepter over the whole world, and when the Messiah came, the way was prepared for the easy and rapid propagation of the new religion to the remotest parts of the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. men &#8230; beasts &#8230; fowls&#8212;the dominion originally designed for man (Ge 1:28; 2:19, 20), forfeited by sin; temporarily delegated to Nebuchadnezzar and the world powers; but, as they abuse the trust for self, instead of for God, to be taken from them by the Son of man, who will exercise it for God, restoring in His person to man the lost inheritance (Ps 8:4-6).<p>Thou art &#8230; head of gold&#8212;alluding to the riches of Babylon, hence called "the golden city" (Isa 14:4; Jer 51:7; Re 18:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hath made thee ruler over them all, </span> i.e. hath given thee absolute dominion of all creatures, men and beasts, within the bounds of thy vast kingdom, to hunt, catch, or kill far thy use and pleasure.

Thou art this head of gold</span>. The Septuagint, if we take along with this verse the final clause of the preceding verse, has even more of that look of exaggeration which we can scarcely fail to be conscious of in the Massoretic, "In all the earth inhabited by men, and wild beasts, and birds of the heaven, and fish of the sea, be delivered (all things) into thy hand to rule over all" The addition to the realm of Nebuchadnezzar of the dwelling-place of the fish of the sea is readily observed. Theodotion has the same addition, "In every place where the sons of men dwell, he gave into thy hand beasts of the earth, birds of the air, fishes of the sea, and appointed thee lord of all." One cannot but observe not only the presence of "the fishes," but also the fact that only the lower animals are given into his power. It may be that here, as in the LXX., the object is to render with slavish exactness the original - unobservant of the fact that the construction was irregular. Behrmann thinks the author had before his mind <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d8;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">hashaltak</span>), "has made thee ruler," and then changed the construction. Something might be said for <span class="accented">Moses</span> Stuart's view that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> should be translated" wherever," it' there were any similar construction to be found. The rendering of the Peshitta agrees with the sense of Moses Stuart, "Every place where the <span class="accented">sons</span> of men dwell, the bird of heaven, or the beast of the field, he hath given into thy band, and caused thee to rule over all of them." The change of order is to be noted. The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic. The word for "dwelling" is an older form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">dareen</span>), instead of the more recent form, which is that read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">dayreen</span>). This copious insertion of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> is an Eastern peculiarity. This assertion of Daniel must seem exaggerated to us, but we must remember the courtly form of address that was usual in Oriental courts, and that Nebuchadnezzar in all likelihood claimed this breadth of empire; so Daniel, in order to make way for the assertion he had already made of the king's dependence on One higher, gives him everything he claims. The addition of the sea to his dominion, although in it Theodotion supports the LXX., is due to a mistaken idea of the point of Daniel's statements. He adds, <span class="accented">Thou art this head of gold.</span> This is not, as Hitzig <span class="accented">asserts</span>, Nebuchadnezzar personally, but to him as the type of the Babylonianmonarch. This was but natural, as of the duration of this monarchy his independent reign extended to the half. Before his advent as "king's son," the Babylonian Empire had to endure the assault of Egypt, and had to struggle for existence against it. With his ado, at began its glory, with his disappearance began at once its decadence. Only under Nebuchadnezzar was Babylon really imperial. The short reigns of his successors are proofs of an insufficient hand upon the reins. With all the tyrannical moods to which be was subject, and all the wild whirlwinds of passion which were liable to carry him away, Nebuchadnezzar, as presented to us here, was a splendid man  - utterly unlike Epiphanes, we may remark in passing, with his low tastes and his cringing submission to Rome. His brilliance was that of Alcibiades; he had nothing of the dignity implied in the head of gold. Nebuchadnezzar had secured the love of this captive, as we see by the sorrow with which Daniel communicated to him his approaching madness. There is thus a reasonableness in making him, in especial, the head of gold. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Sacrificial Kitchens for the Priests and for the People<p><a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>. And he brought me up the entrance by the shoulder of the gate to the holy cells for the priests, which looked to the north; and behold there was a place on the outermost side toward the west. <a href="/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>. And he said to me, This is the place where the priests boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, where they bake the meat-offering that they may not need to carry it out into the outer court, to sanctify the people. <a href="/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a>. And he led me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was again a court. <a href="/ezekiel/46-22.htm">Ezekiel 46:22</a>. In the four corners of the court were closed courts of forty cubits in length and thirty cubits in breadth; all four corner spaces had one measure. <a href="/ezekiel/46-23.htm">Ezekiel 46:23</a>. And a row of stands was round about therein in all four, and boiling hearths were under the  rows made round about. <a href="/ezekiel/46-24.htm">Ezekiel 46:24</a>. And he said to me, These are the kitchen-house, where the servants of the house boil the slain-offering of the people. - In the list and description of the subordinate buildings of the temple, the sacrificial kitchens are passed over; and they are therefore referred to here again in a supplementary manner. Ewald has shifted <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-24</a>, and placed them after <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>, which would certainly have been the most suitable place for mentioning the sacrificial kitchens for the priests. But it is evident that they stood here originally, and not there; not only from the fact that in <a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a> the passage to the holy cells (<a href="/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>.) is circumstantially described, which would have been unnecessary if the description of the kitchens had originally followed immediately after <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-14.htm">Ezekiel 42:14</a>, as Ezekiel was then standing by the cells; but also, and still more clearly, from the words that serve as an introduction to what follows, "he led me back to the door of the house" (<a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>), which are unintelligible unless he had changed his standing-place between <a href="/ezekiel/46-18.htm">Ezekiel 46:18</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>, as is related in <a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a>, since Ezekiel had received the sacrificial thorah (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5-46:18</a>) in front of the house (<a href="/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>). If <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-24</a> had originally stood elsewhere, so that <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a> was immediately connected with <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-18.htm">Ezekiel 46:18</a>, the transition-formula in <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a> would necessarily have read very differently. - But with this section the right of the preceding one, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16-18</a>, which Ewald has arbitrarily interpolated in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45.htm">Ezekiel 45</a> between <a href="/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9</a>, to hold its present place in the chapter before us as an appendix, is fully vindicated. - The holy cells (<a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>) are those of the northern cell-building (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-10</a>) described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1-14</a> (see Plate I L). &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; is the approach or way mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-9.htm">Ezekiel 42:9</a>, which led from the northern inner gate to these cells (see Plate I l); not the place to which Ezekiel was brought (Kliefoth), but the passage along which he was led. The spot to which he was conducted follows in &#1488;&#1500;  (the article before the construct state, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a>, etc.). &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is appended to this in the form of an apposition; and here &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; is to be repeated in thought: to those for the priests. '&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510; belongs to &#1492;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;. There, i.e., by the cells, was a space set apart at the outermost (hindermost) sides toward the west (Plate I M), for the boiling of the flesh of the trespass-offering and sin-offering, and the baking of the minchah, - that is to say, of those portions of the sacrifices which the priests were to eat in their official capacity (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/42-13.htm">Ezekiel 42:13</a>). For the motive assigned in <a href="/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a> for the provision of special kitchens for this object, see the exposition of <a href="/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>.<p>In addition to these, kitchens were required for the preparation of the sacrificial meals, which were connected with the offering of the shelamim, and were held by those who presented them. These sacrificial kitchens for the people are treated of in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20-24</a>. They were situated in the four corners of the outer court (Plate I N). To show them to the prophet, the angel leads him into the outer court. The holy cells (<a href="/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>) and the sacrificial kitchens for the priests (<a href="/ezekiel/46-20.htm">Ezekiel 46:20</a>) were also situated by the outside wall of the inner court; and for this reason Ezekiel had already been led out of the inner court, where he had received the sacrificial thorah, through the northern gate of the court by the way which led to the holy cells, that he might be shown the sacrificial kitchens. When, therefore, it is stated in <a href="/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a> that "he led me out into the outer court," &#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; can only be explained on the supposition that the space from the surrounding wall of the inner court to the way which led from the gate porch of that court to the holy cells, and to the passage which continued this way in front of the cells (Plate I l and m), was regarded as an appurtenance of the inner court. In every one of the four corners of the outer court there was a (small) courtyard in the court. The repetition of '&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1506; &#1492;&#1495; has a distributive force. The small courtyards in the four corners of the court were &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, i.e., not "uncovered," as this would be unmeaning, since all courts or courtyards were uncovered; nor "contracted" (Bttcher), for &#1511;&#1496;&#1512; has no such meaning; nor "fumum exhalantia," as the Talmudists suppose; nor "bridged over" (Hitzig), which there is also nothing in the language to sustain; but in all probability atria clausa, i.e., muris cincta et janius clausa (Ges. Thes.), from &#1511;&#1496;&#1512;; in Aram. ligavit; in Ethiop. clausit, obseravit januam. The word &#1502;&#1492;&#1511;&#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; is marked with puncta extraordinaria by the Masoretes as a suspicious word, and is also omitted in the Septuagint and Vulgate. Bttcher and Hitzig have therefore expunged it as a gloss. But even Hitzig admits that this does not explain how it found its way into the text. The word is a Hophal participle of &#1511;&#1510;&#1506;, in the sense of cornered off, cut off into corners, and is in apposition to the suffix to &#1500;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, - literally, one measure wax to all four, the spaces or courtyards cut off in the corners. For this appositional use of the participle, compare <a href="/1_kings/14-6.htm">1 Kings 14:6</a>. There is also a difference of opinion as to the meaning of the word &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, which only occurs here and in <a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17</a>. and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-10.htm">Ezekiel 39:10</a>, where it signifies "row," and not "enclosure" (Kliefoth). &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, which follows, is evidently merely the feminine plural, from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is also derived from &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, in the sense of "to encircle" (see the comm. on <a href="/psalms/69-26.htm">Psalm 69:26</a>). Consequently &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; does not mean a covering or boundary wall, but a row or shelf of brickwork which had several separate shelves, under which the cooking hearths were placed. &#1502;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, not kitchens, but cooking hearths; strictly speaking a partic. Piel, things which cause to boil. -  &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;  - .liob ot e, kitchen house. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the temple servants, as distinguished from the servants of Jehovah (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15-16</a>), are the Levites (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11-12</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; is construed as in <a href="/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18-19</a>. </body></html>
