The insufficiency of creatures should drive us to the all-sufficiency of the Creator. There is One who can do that for us, and make known that to us, which none on earth can, particularly the work of redemption, and the secret designs of God's love to us therein. Daniel confirmed the king in his opinion, that the dream was of great consequence, relating to the affairs and changes of this lower world. Let those whom God has highly favoured and honoured, lay aside all opinion of their own wisdom and worthiness, that the Lord alone may be praised for the good they have and do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded, cannot the wise men ... show unto the king - Daniel regarded it as a settled and indisputable point that the solution could not be hoped for from the Chaldean sages. The highest talent which the realm could furnish had been applied to, and had failed. It was clear, therefore, that there was no hope that the difficulty would be removed by human skill. Besides this, Daniel would seem also to intimate that the thing, from the necessity of the case, was beyond the compass of the human powers. Alike in reference to the question whether a forgotten dream could be recalled, and to the actual "signification" of a dream so remarkable as this, the whole matter was beyond the ability of man.<p>The wise men, the astrologers ... - On these words, see the notes at <a href="/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a>. All these words occur in that verse, except &#1490;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;  ga&#770;zer&#305;&#770;yn - rendered "soothsayers." This is derived from &#1490;&#1494;&#1512;  gezar - "to cut, to cut off;" and then "to decide, to determine;" and it is thus applied to those who decide or determine the fates or destiny of men; that is, those who "by casting nativities from the place of the stars at one's birth, and by various arts of computing and divining, foretold the fortunes and destinies of individuals." See Gesenius, "Com. z. Isa." 2:349-356, Section 4, Von den Chaldern und deren Astrologie. On p. 555, he has given a figure, showing how the heavens were "cut up," or "divided," by astrologers in the practice of their art. Compare the phrase numeri Babylonii, in Hor. "Carm." I. xi. 2. The Greek is &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  gazare&#772;no&#772;n - the Chaldee word in Greek letters. This is one of the words - not very few in number - which the authors of the Greek version did not attempt to translate. Such words, however, are not useless, as they serve to throw light on the question how the Hebrew and Chaldee were pronounced before the vowel points were affixed to those languages. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. cannot&#8212;Daniel, being learned in all the lore of the Chaldeans (Da 1:4), could authoritatively declare the impossibility of mere man solving the king's difficulty.<p>soothsayers&#8212;from a root, "to cut off"; referring to their cutting the heavens into divisions, and so guessing at men's destinies from the place of the stars at one's birth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He reckons up here all sorts of divination, to show that divine things, and the secrets of God, cannot be comprehended by man without special revelation; and that those who presume to do it arrogate too much to themselves, and that it is too tyrannical to require it of any, and that upon pain of death; for, saith Daniel, they cannot do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Daniel answered in the presence of the king,....

The last word, rendered "soothsayers" (u), is not used before; the Septuagint version leaves it untranslated, and calls them Gazarenes; and so Saadiah says, it is the name of a nation or people so called; but Jarchi takes them to be a sort of men that had confederacy with devils: the word signifies such that "cut" into parts, as the soothsayers, who cut up creatures, and looked into their entrails, and by them made their judgment of events; or as the astrologers, who cut and divide the heavens into parts, and by them divide future things; or determine, as Jacchiades says, what shall befall men; for the word is used also in the sense of determining or decreeing; hence, Saadiah says, some interpret it of princes, who by their words determine the affairs of kingdoms: by some it is rendered "fatalists" (w), who declare to men what their fate will be; but neither of these could show this secret to the king. <p>(u) sectores, Cocceius, Gejerus.

The Babylonians were famed for their astrology, and in classical times the idea of astrologer was that which was almost entirely associated with the term ‘Chaldaean’ (cf. above, p. 13). The verb (strictly, <span class="ital">to cut</span>), in the general sense of <span class="ital">decide, decree</span>, occurs in the Targums and in Syriac, and once also in the Aramaizing idiom of Job (<a href="/job/22-28.htm" title="You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you: and the light shall shine on your ways.">Job 22:28</a>); cf. the cognate subst., <a href="/daniel/4-14.htm" title="He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:">Daniel 4:14</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-21.htm" title="Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelled, and on whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:">Daniel 4:21</a>.

The differences between this and the Septuagint are but slight and unimportant. To render it literally, the LXX. is, "Daniel, having spoken out in the presence of the king, said, The mystery which the king saw is nut the showing of the wise men, the astrologers,  the sorcerers, the magicians." There seems to have been a confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> ('<span class="accented">anah</span>), "to answer," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tzenah</span>), "to cry out;" the latter word is unsuitable in the present connection. The change from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d6;&#x5d4;</span> is unlikely to have been the result of any mistake in the writing of the original. It may have been the Greek scribe who misread <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion and the Peshitta present no peculiarities worthy of notice. Jerome translates <span class="accented">asbshaphim</span> by magi, as usual, following the Peshitta. It is to be observed that here again we have a list of the different <span class="accented">classes</span> of <span class="accented">soothsayers</span>, and the class of Chaldeans is omitted, as also those marked as <span class="accented">mecashphim</span> in ver. 2; instead, occupying the same place in the catalogue, is <span class="accented">gazrin.</span> This may have been the original word, as evidently the real meaning was not known either in Egypt or Asia Minor, as both the LXX. and Theodotion transfer the word. The Peshitta translates this word by <span class="accented">asuphe</span>, in reality the corresponding one to the second word in the Chaldee. This would seem to show that the word had disappeared from Eastern as well as Western Aramaic. It is derived from <span class="accented">gezar</span>, "to eat." Behrmann ('Das Buch Daniel') derives it thus, and <span class="accented">says</span> that it refers to the fact that those who studied nativities divided the heavens into <span class="accented">sectiones</span> or <span class="accented">segmenta.</span> This was precisely what the "Chaldeans" of classic times did; hence it is quite a possible thing that Chaldeans was inserted in some Greek translations, and got into the Aramaic from the Greek. The word does not seem to be used for , astrologers" in the Talmud. The occasion of Daniel's narrating the impotence of the other wise men in presence of the task set them by the king is that probably he recognized the accent of surprise in the king's tone. As if he said, "Yes, it is perfectly true, what none of these wise men could do, I, a mere youth, undertake to do." There is nothing of contempt for them in this, as is seen in the following verse. There may be a shade of rebuke implied to the king, who had demanded from men what they could not do. They had declared that only the gods could reveal this to the king. And what Daniel says is not in opposition to this, but confirmatory of it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the Opening of the Temple for the People, and for the Voluntary Offerings of the Prince. - <a href="/ezekiel/46-8.htm">Ezekiel 46:8</a>.

It is in this sense that &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is used here in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a>, and not &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, because what is laid down concerning the entrance and exit of the people, when visiting the temple, is not merely intended to apply to the high festivals, on which the people were bound to appear before Jehovah, but also to such feast days as the Sabbaths and new moons, whenever individuals from among the people were desirous of their own free-will to worship before the Lord. The latter cases were not to be excluded, although, as <a href="/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a> clearly shows, the great feasts were principally kept in mind.

Both are to go out walking straight forward; and neither of them is to turn in the court for the purpose of going out by the gate through which he entered. Even in <a href="/ezekiel/46-10.htm">Ezekiel 46:10</a> &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be altered, as Hitzig supposes, but to be taken as referring to the prince and the people. - In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-11.htm">Ezekiel 46:11</a>, the instructions given in <a href="/ezekiel/45-24.htm">Ezekiel 45:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-5.htm">Ezekiel 46:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>, concerning the quantities composing the meat-offering for the different feasts, are repeated here as rules applicable to all festal times. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; has been correctly explained as follows: "at the feasts, and generally at all regular (more correctly, established) seasons," cf. <a href="/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>.
