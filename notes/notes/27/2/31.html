The image, though representing many things, was itself only “one.” (See Note on <a href="/daniel/2-1.htm" title="And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.">Daniel 2:1</a>.) That the image was of human form is evident from the further descriptions of the various parts of the body given in <a href="/context/daniel/2-32.htm" title="This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,">Daniel 2:32-33</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-42.htm" title="And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.">Daniel 2:42</a>. The “greatness” of the image implies the magnificence and size of it.

This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and the form thereof was terrible.">Daniel 2:31</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image — </span>“It appears, from ancient coins and medals, that cities and people were often represented by figures of men and women. A great, terrible human figure was therefore a proper emblem of human power and dominion; and the various metals of which it was composed not unfitly typified the various kingdoms which should arise. It consisted of four different metals, gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, mixed with clay; and these four metals, according to Daniel’s own interpretation, mean so many kingdoms; and the order of their succession is clearly denoted by the order of the parts; the head and higher parts signify the earlier times, and the lower parts the latter times. Hesiod, who lived two hundred years before Daniel, spoke of the four ages of the world under the symbols of these metals; so that this image was formed according to the commonly received notion, and the commonly received notion was not first propagated from hence.” — Bishop Newton. <span class="ital">This image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee — </span>This image, says Grotius, appeared with a glorious lustre in the imagination of Nebuchadnezzar, whose mind was wholly taken up with admiration of worldly pomp and splendour; but the same monarchies were represented to Daniel under the shape of fierce and wild beasts, chap. 7., as being the great supporters of idolatry and tyranny in the world. <span class="ital">And the form thereof was terrible — </span>The success which accompanied their arms made them feared and dreaded by all the world.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:31-45 This image represented the kingdoms of the earth, that should successively rule the nations, and influence the affairs of the Jewish church. 1. The head of gold signified the Chaldean empire, then in being. 2. The breast and arms of silver signified the empire of the Medes and Persians. 3. The belly and thighs of brass signified the Grecian empire, founded by Alexander. 4. The legs and feet of iron signified the Roman empire. The Roman empire branched into ten kingdoms, as the toes of these feet. Some were weak as clay, others strong as iron. Endeavours have often been used to unite them, for strengthening the empire, but in vain. The stone cut out without hands, represented the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should be set up in the kingdoms of the world, upon the ruins of Satan's kingdom in them. This was the Stone which the builders refused, because it was not cut out by their hands, but it is become the head stone of the corner. Of the increase of Christ's government and peace there shall be no end. The Lord shall reign, not only to the end of time, but when time and days shall be no more. As far as events have gone, the fulfilling this prophetic vision has been most exact and undeniable; future ages shall witness this Stone destroying the image, and filling the whole earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou, O king, sawest - Margin, "wast seeing." The margin is in accordance with the Chaldee. The language is properly what denotes a prolonged or attentive observation. He was in an attitude favorable to vision, or was looking with intensity, and there appeared before him this remarkable image. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1-2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a>. It was not a thing which appeared for a moment, and then vanished, but which remained so long that he could contemplate it with accuracy.<p>And, behold, a great image - Chaldee, "one image that was grand" - &#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1497;&#1488; &#1495;&#1491; &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;  tsele&#772;m chad s'ag&#305;&#770;y'. So the Vulgate - statua una grandis. So the Greek - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  eiko&#772;n mia. The object seems to be to fix the attention on the fact that there was but "one" image, though composed of so different materials, and of materials that seemed to be so little fitted to be worked together into the same statue. The idea, by its being represented as "one," is, that it was, in some respects, "the same kingdom" that he saw symbolized: that is, that it would extend over the same countries, and could be, in some sense, regarded as a prolongation of the same empire. There was so much of "identity," though different in many respects, that it could be represented as "one." The word rendered "image" (&#1510;&#1500;&#1501;  tselem) denotes properly "a shade," or "shadow," and then anything that "shadows forth," or that represents anything.<p>It is applied to man <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a> as shadowing forth, or representing God; that is, there was something in man when he was created which had so far a resemblance to God that he might be regarded as an "image" of him. The word is often used to denote idols - as supposed to be a "representation" of the gods, either in their forms, or as shadowing forth their character as majestic, stern, mild, severe, merciful, etc. <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-17.htm">2 Chronicles 23:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-20.htm">Ezekiel 7:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-14.htm">Ezekiel 23:14</a>; <a href="/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>. This image is not represented as an idol to be worshipped, nor in the use of the word is it to be supposed that there is an allusion, as Prof. Bush supposes, to the fact that these kingdoms would be idolatrous, but the word is used in its proper and primitive sense, to denote something which would "represent," or "shadow forth," the kingdoms which would exist. The exact "size" of the image is not mentioned. It is only suggested that it was great - a proper characteristic to represent the "greatness" of the kingdoms to which it referred.<p>This great image - The word here rendered "great" (&#1512;&#1489;  rab) is different from that used in the previous clause, though it is not easy to determine the exact difference between the words. Both denote that the image was of gigantic dimensions. It is well remarked by Prof. Bush, that "the monuments of antiquity sufficiently evince that the humor prevailed throughout the East, and still more in Egypt, of constructing enormous statues, which were usually dedicated to some of their deities, and connected with their worship. The object, therefore, now presented in the monarch's dream was not, probably, entirely new to his thoughts."<p>Whose brightness was excellent - "Whose brightness "excelled," or was unusual and remarkable." The word rendered brightness (&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;  z&#305;&#770;yv) is found only in Daniel. It is rendered "brightness" in <a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-36.htm">Daniel 4:36</a>, and in the margin in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>, <a href="/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9</a>; and "countenance" in <a href="/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a> (text), and in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9-10</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-28.htm">Daniel 7:28</a>. From the places where it is found, particularly <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-36.htm">Daniel 4:36</a>, it is clear that it is used to denote a certain beauty, or majesty, shining forth in the countenance, which was fitted to impress the beholder with awe. The term here is to be understood not merely of the face of the image, but of its entire aspect, as having something in it signally splendid and imposing. We have only to conceive of a colossal statue whose head was burnished gold, and a large part of whose frame was polished silver, to see the force of this language.<p>Stood before thee - It stood over against him in full view. He had an opportunity of surveying it clearly and distinctly.<p>And the form thereof was terrible - Vast, imposing, grand, fearful. The sudden appearance of such an object as this could not but fill the mind with terror. The design for which this representation was made to Nebuchadnezzar is clearly unfolded in the explanation which Daniel gives. It may be remarked here, in general, that such an appearance of a gigantic image was well adapted to represent successive kingdoms, and that the representation was in accordance with the spirit of ancient times. "In ancient coins and medals," says the editor of the "Pictorial Bible," "nothing is more common than to see cities and nations represented by human figures, male or female. According to the ideas which suggested such symbols, a vast image in the human figure was, therefore, a very fit emblem of sovereign power and dominion; while the materials of which it was composed did most significantly typify the character of the various empires, the succession of which was foreshown by this vision. This last idea, of expressing the condition of things by metallic symbols, was prevalent before the time of Daniel. Hesiod, who lived about two centuries before Daniel, characterizes the succession of ages (four) by the very same metals - gold, silver, brass, and iron." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. The world power in its totality appears as a colossal human form: Babylon the head of gold, Medo-Persia the breast and two arms of silver, Gr&aelig;co-Macedonia the belly and two thighs of brass, and Rome, with its Germano-Slavonic offshoots, the legs of iron and feet of iron and clay, the fourth still existing. Those kingdoms only are mentioned which stand in some relation to the kingdom of God; of these none is left out; the final establishment of that kingdom is the aim of His moral government of the world. The colossus of metal stands on weak feet, of clay. All man's glory is as ephemeral and worthless as chaff (compare 1Pe 1:24). But the kingdom of God, small and unheeded as a "stone" on the ground is compact in its homogeneous unity; whereas the world power, in its heterogeneous constituents successively supplanting one another, contains the elements of decay. The relation of the stone to the mountain is that of the kingdom of the cross (Mt 16:23; Lu 24:26) to the kingdom of glory, the latter beginning, and the former ending when the kingdom of God breaks in pieces the kingdoms of the world (Re 11:15). Christ's contrast between the two kingdoms refers to this passage.<p>a great image&#8212;literally, "one image that was great." Though the kingdoms were different, it was essentially one and the same world power under different phases, just as the image was one, though the parts were of different metals.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A great image; </span> not a painted, superficial image, but a massy one, a statue in man’s shape, great, splendid, majestical: thus they were wont of old to represent great emperors and empires, and worshipped them as gods: called here an image, and in a dream, all which is in show and shadow rather than in substance, and therefore vanishing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Stood before thee, </span> and that upright, of a prodigious height, noting the grandeur of those monarchies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The form thereof was terrible:</span> government is to be feared, fear to whom fear, and honour to whom honour; also some had rather be feared than loved.

This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible</span>. The Greek versions do not require notice, as they do not imply any difference in reading from the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is shorter, "Thou, O king, wert seeing, and, lo! a great image of beauty exceeding excellent, and it stood before thee." The opening clause of the next verse may be regarded as taking up the last clause of the verse before us. As to the Aramaic of the passage, it is to be observed that the s, me long form of the second person is used in ver. 29. The numeral <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">had</span>) is used in this verse very much in the sense of the English indefinite article which is used to translate it in the English versions. It is represented in the Greek Version by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">ulu</span>)," behold," does not occur in the Targums; a cognate form occurs in Samaritan, <span class="accented">hala.</span> In Talmudic it occurs in a form like the Samaritan. This word occurs in ch. 7, varied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">aru</span>), which is regarded as a phonetic variation. It may, however, be due to defective penmanship, having the top of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> too faintly written. Its etymology is doubtful. No Assyrian root has been found from which it may be derived. The word for "image," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">tzelem</span>), occurs in the Palmyrene inscriptions, as the regular term for a memorial statue. Hence, unless reason can be shown to the contrary, we could assume, even though there had been no more, that the figure was like a statue of a man. The word for this, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>), occurs only in Daniel; the corresponding word in Ezra is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The n sound is one that so readily slips away, that its presence as a final letter is a sign that the form of a word possessing it is in an older stage than that without it; hence we would argue that as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>) is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">da</span>) of the Targums, so <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>) of Daniel is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The word that is most interesting is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">ziveh</span>); it is rendered "brightness" in our version. It is recognized by Professor Bevan, on the authority of Delitzsch, as an Assyrio-Babylonian word, therefore affording an additional evidence of the Eastern origin of Daniel. Noldeke would derive it from the Persian <span class="accented">zeb</span> (quoted by Behrmann, but there is some mistake in his reference). This tendency to derive everything from the Persian is to be suspected. The long political connection between Babylon and the Aryan nations north and east of it might easily introduce words of such an origin into the writings of a Babylonian diplomat. Another derivation is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zahah</span>), but seems doubtful, as, although in Hebrew, there is no trace of such a verb in Aramaic. The only other word that merits note is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">reve</span>), "appearance." Professor Bevan <span class="accented">says</span> it is the only appearance in Aramaic of a corresponding root to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">ra'ah</span>), "to see." Daniel, it will be seen, lays <span class="accented">stress</span> on the emotions which each feature excited, in order to recall, not only the dream, but something of the feelings with which Nebuchadnezzar had beheld it. With this dream of Nebuchadnezzar we might compare the dream of the seer of Asshurbanipal, given by Lenormant ('La Divination,' p. 137), "The seer (<span class="accented">voyant</span>) narrated to Asshurbanipal how the goddess Istar had stood before him seated in her chariot, surrounded by flame, with a bow in her hand" (see also Smith's 'Assurbanipal,' pp. 123. 124). It is unlikely that the colossal image was identified by Nebuchadnezzar with any one of the Babylonian gods; perhaps this was one of the elements of the terror excited by the vision, that he could not identify him. If he did make any identification, Daniel does not do anything to justify him in any such identification. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Daily Sacrifice<p><a href="/ezekiel/46-13.htm">Ezekiel 46:13</a>.

Every morning a yearling lamb is to be brought as a burnt-offering. The Mosaic law required such a lamb both morning and evening (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-4</a>). The new thorah omits the evening sacrifice, but increases the meat-offering to the sixth of an ephah of meal and the third of a hin of oil, against the tenth of an ephah of meal and the fourth of a hin of oil prescribed by the Mosaic law (<a href="/numbers/28-5.htm">Numbers 28:5</a>). &#1512;&#1505;, from &#1512;&#1505;&#1505;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.., to moisten (cf. &#1512;&#1505;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, Sol 5:2). The plural &#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; refers to the burnt-offering and meat-offering. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; is added to give greater force, and, according to the correct remark of Hitzig, appears to be intended as a substitute for &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-21.htm">Leviticus 23:21</a>, <a href="/leviticus/23-31.htm">Leviticus 23:31</a>. The repeated emphasizing of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511; shows that the silence as to the evening sacrifice is not a mere oversight of the matter, but that in the new order of worship the evening sacrifice is to be omitted. The Chetib &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; is to be retained, in opposition to the Keri &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;.<p>This brings to an end the new order of worship. The verses which follow in the chapter before us introduce two supplementary notices, - namely, a regulation pointing back to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-7.htm">Ezekiel 45:7-9</a>, concerning the right of the prince to hand down or give away his landed property (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16-18</a>); and a brief description of the sacrificial kitchens for priests and people (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19-24</a>). </body></html>
