He was really made great by the grace of God, and the extraordinary favor which God had bestowed upon him, but the estimate which the king had of his greatness was shown by the tokens of the royal favor. "And gave him many great gifts." This is a common way of showing esteem in the East. The estimate in which one holds another is evinced by the variety and richness of the presents conferred on him. Hence, all persons of distinction expect gifts of those who approach them as expressive of their regard for them, and of the esteem in which they are held. Compare <a href="/daniel/2-6.htm">Daniel 2:6</a>.<p>And made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon - Chaldee, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492;  hashelet&#803;e&#772;h - caused him to preside over, or to rule over, from the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;  shelat&#803;, "to rule," and commonly applied to one who rules as a prince, or in an elevated office. From this word the terms "sultan" and "sultana" are derived.<p>And chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon - This would seem to be an appointment which did not pertain to him as governor of the province of Babylon, or as presiding in the capital, but was a separate appointment, and, therefore, an additional mark of favor. The phrase "chief of the governors" would seem to imply that the magi of Babylon were disposed in certain orders or classes, each of which had its appropriate head, like the head of a college or university. Daniel was placed over the whole as the president, principal, or chancellor. It had been the policy of Nebuchadnezzar to assemble at the capital the principal talent and learning of the realm.

Daniel thus, in both these stations of honor at an early period of life, though recently an unknown stranger, and a captive; was exalted to the highest honors which could be conferred on a subject, and raised to posts of distinction which would usually be regarded as the highest rewards which could be obtained by a long life of devotedness to the welfare of the country. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>48.

The Septuagint renders the last clause of ver. 48 "chief and ruler (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of all the wise men of Babylon," reading <span class="accented">us gan</span> instead of <span class="accented">signeen.</span> Theodotion's is a fairly accurate rendering of the Massoretic text, as is also Jerome. The Peshitta renders this clause, "He made Daniel head over all the mighty men (<span class="accented">rabiheela</span>), and over all the wise men of Babylon." The translator must have inserted, or found before him inserted, the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">el</span>), "over," between <span class="accented">tab</span> and <span class="accented">signeen</span>, evidently a false reading, due to ignorance of the form Babylonianand Assyrian titles assumed. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>:, was originally maintained to be Persian. Hitzig connects it with an Arabic root, <span class="accented">sajan</span>, but the true derivation is now found to be <span class="accented">shokun</span> (Assyrian), "<span class="accented">governor."</span> It appears in Hebrew in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the deutero-Isaiah, as well as in Ezra and Nehemiah, showing the unlikelihood of any Persian derivation. Hitzig appears to regard Daniel as made the king's regent over the whole empire of Babylon; but this is not at all the meaning of the words. We must not be led away to  believe that all this promotion befell Daniel at once; the statement here is summary, and includes many steps, and perhaps several years. Even at the utmost of his exaltation, he is not represented here as being made the regent of Nebuchadnezzar. as Hitzig would maintain. It is really only the province of Babylon, if we may not restrict the meaning of the word <span class="accented">medeena</span> even further, and regard it as equivalent to "city." We admit that this restriction of significance is not supported by the versions, but the fact that in so many cases we have traces of Syriac influences in Daniel, and that <span class="accented">medeena</span> means in Syriac "a city," renders this supposition not an impossible one. The precise limits of the province of Babylon in the days of Nebuchadnezzar cannot be settled. In later times it consisted mainly of the territory between the Tigris and the Euphrates, south of the <span class="accented">murus Medius</span>, with some territory between the latter river and the desert (Professor Rawlinson). It may be that the satrapy of Babylon was of considerably less extent. The word <span class="accented">hashleet</span> means "to cause to rule." This would be made true by making Daniel overseer in any department of the government of the province. It is not necessary to maintain that Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel satrap of Babylonia; at the same time, <span class="accented">shalet</span> is the title given to the satrap of Babylon. M. Lenormant thinks there must be an interpolation when Daniel is said to be set over all the governors of the wise men in Babylon. His arguments are founded mainly on the belief that the castes of astrologers, soothsayers, and magians - all that were included in the class of <span class="accented">hakmeen -</span> were hereditary, a thing which has not been proved. A difficulty has been urged by Lenormant that Daniel, as a zealous Jew, could not become head of a college of idolatrous priests. While there may be some force in this, one must beware of testing the actions of a Jew of the  <span class="date">sixth century B.C.</span> by criteria and principles applicable to one of later times. At all events, this militates strongly against the idea that the Book of Daniel was written in the age of the Maccabees. When we see Daniel thus, a youth of probably two or three and twenty, promoted ultimately to be over the province of Babylon, and to be one of the king's most trusted councillors, Ezekiel's saying, which places him between Noah and Job (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>), becomes natural. Daniel had already been some years in the king's privy council before Ezekiel was carried into captivity. We do not know how long after the beginning of his prophetic work we are to date the prophecy of the fourteenth chapter - it may have been eight or nine years after. But even if it were only six years, Daniel would by this time have been for eleven years a member of the privy council of the Babylonian monarch, and possibly for a considerable portion of that period governor of the province of Babylon. At any rate, Daniel would bulk very large in the eyes of the poor Jewish captives. Though contemporary, he was so far removed from his fellow-countrymen in social position, that his goodness and greatness would be subject to similar exaggeration to that which happens to heroes of a long-past age. A better argument may be drawn from the fact that <span class="accented">sagan</span> is always a civil title. The insertion of the word <span class="accented">hakmeen</span> might easily be due to some scribe who thought that as Daniel was one of the wise men, head of them would be more likely than head of the civil governors of the province, and placed it as a suggestion of what ought to take the place of <span class="accented">signeen</span>; a copyist following, inserted it in the text. If we compare this chapter with the sixth, we find Daniel one of three who were to receive the accounts of the various governors. Daniel was thus, if we may apply to his office a title drawn from our own political usage, secretary of state for Babylonia. It is characteristic of Daniel, that having been made rich and great by the king, and having received many gifts at the hand of the king, does not satisfy him; he entreats favour for his friends also. Hitzig's objection that Daniel would have the appointment of his subordinates, would only be valid if Daniel had been made satrap If his <span class="accented">shaletship</span> extended merely to some one department of governmental work - and that seems to follow from the last clause of this verse - it is unlikely that he would have this power. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are set over the "business" ('<span class="accented">el</span>,<span class="accented">eedt</span>,') of the province of Babylon. This word, in Targumic Aramaic, is very generally used of constructions where labour is employed. We may regard their position as one something like being members of a labour bureau. Nebuchadezzar was a very great builder, so much so that almost all the bricks that have been got in Babylon are stamped with his name. While his Ninevite predecessors record in their inscriptions their campaigns, the kings they conquered, and the cities they sacked, the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar are almost entirely occupied with the various structures - temples, palaces, ramparts, and canals - which he had caused to be made. These buildings would need perpetual surveying. Further, as a great military genius, roads and canals would also be. important objects, in the carrying out of which captives would be employed. And the products of this enforced labour would have to be surveyed carefully. This seems  more probable than that Daniel got these three friends appointed to do the work he himself was appointed to. The only plausible suggestion against this would be that Daniel desired that his friends be <span class="accented">set</span> jointly over the province of Babylon instead of himself, and, for his own part, he preferred to remain in the gate of the king. We know that those who wished to undermine a favourite in an Eastern court, frequently intrigued to get him promoted to a governorship, and then poisoned the mind of the king against him. On the other hand. the fact that Daniel had his province in Babylon, and would always be near the king when he was in his capital, rendered the implied precaution needless. <span class="accented">But Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</span> The gate of the king was the gate of his palace or the entrance to the central court from which all the apartments branched off. In the gate the kings of the East acted as judges over their people; in the gate the king held councils. Hence to sit in the gate of the king conveyed the twofold idea of being the king's representative on the throne of judgment, and of being the counsellor of the king - member of the privy council, to employ a modern term. <p> <p> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/47.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The River of Water of Life<p>When Jehovah shall have judged all the heathen in the valley of Jehoshaphat, and shall dwell as King of His people upon Zion His holy mountain, then will the mountains trickle with new wine, and the hills run with milk, and all the brooks of Judah flow with water; and a spring will proceed from the house of Jehovah, and water the Acacia valley. With these figures Joel (<a href="/joel/4-18.htm">Joel 4:18</a>) has already described the river of salvation, which the Lord would cause to flow to His congregation in the time when the kingdom of God shall be perfected.

And it will come to pass, every living thing with which it swarms everywhere, whither the double river comes, will live, and there will be very many fishes; for when this water comes thither they will become wholesome, and everything will live whither the river comes. <a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>.

And their fruits will serve as food, and their leaves as medicine.<p>From the outer court, where Ezekiel had been shown the sacrificial kitchens for the people (<a href="/ezekiel/46-21.htm">Ezekiel 46:21</a>.), he is taken back to the front of the door of the temple house, to be shown a spring of water, flowing out from under the threshold of the temple, which has swollen in the short course of four thousand cubits from its source into a deep river in which men can swim, and which flows down to the Jordan valley, to empty itself into the Dead Sea. In <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-2.htm">Ezekiel 47:2</a>, the origin and course of this water are described; in <a href="/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-5.htm">Ezekiel 47:5</a>, its marvellous increase; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a>, the growth of trees on its banks; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7-12</a>, its emptying itself into the Arabah and into the Dead Sea, with the life-giving power of its water. - <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>. The door of the house is the entrance into the holy place of the temple, and &#1502;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; the threshold of this door. &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, not "in the east" (Hitzig), for the following sentence explaining the reason does not require this meaning; but "toward the east" of the threshold, which lay toward the east, for the front of the temple was in the east. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; is not to be connected with &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1507;, but to be taken by itself, only not in the sense of downwards (Hitzig), but from beneath, namely, down from the right shoulder of the house. &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;, to flow down, because the temple stood on higher ground than the inner court. The right shoulder is the part of the eastern wall of the holy place between the door and the pillars, the breadth of which was five cubits (<a href="/ezekiel/41-1.htm">Ezekiel 41:1</a>). The water therefore issued from the corner formed by the southern wall of the porch and the eastern wall of the holy place (see the sketch on Plate I), and flowed past the altar of burnt-offering on the south side, and crossed the court in an easterly direction, passing under its surrounding wall. It then flowed across the outer court and under the pavement and the eastern wall into the open country, where the prophet, on the outside in front of the gate, saw it rippling forth from the right shoulder of that gate. That he might do this, he was led out through the north gate, because the east gate was shut (<a href="/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>), and round by the outside wall to the eastern outer gate. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is more minutely defined by &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, and this, again, by &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, "by the way to the (gate) looking eastwards."

The right shoulder is that portion of the eastern wall which joined the south side of the gate. - <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3-5</a>. The miraculous increase in the depth of the water. A thousand cubits from the wall, as one walked through, it reached to the ankles; a thousand cubits further, to the knees; a thousand cubits further, to the hips; and after going another thousand cubits it was impossible to wade through, one could only swim therein. The words &#1502;&#1497; &#1488;&#1508;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; are a brief expression for "there was water which reached to the ankles." &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; is equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;, an ankle, not the sole of the foot. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>, on the other hand, we have &#1508;&#1468;&#1505; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1508;&#1505; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; .

The measuring man directed the prophet's attention (<a href="/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a>) to this extraordinary increase in the stream of water, because the miraculous nature of the stream was exhibited therein. A natural river could not increase to such an extent within such short distances, unless, indeed, other streams emptied themselves into it on all sides, which was not he case here. He then directed him to go back again &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;, along the bank, not "to the bank," as he had never left it. The purpose for which he had been led along the bank was accomplished after he had gone four thousand cubits. From the increase in the water, as measured up to this point, he could infer what depth it would reach in its further course. He is therefore now to return along the bank to see how it is covered with trees. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; cannot be explained in any other way than as an incorrect form for &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;, though there are no corresponding analogies to be found.<p>In <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8-12</a> he gives him a still further explanation of the course of the river and the effect of its waters. The river flows out into &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, the eastern circle, which is identical with &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; htiw lacitne, the circle of the Jordan (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-11</a>), the region above the Dead Sea, where the Jordan valley (Ghor) widens out into a broad, deep basin. &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is the deep valley of the Jordan, now called the Ghor (see the comm. on <a href="/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>), of which Robinson says that the greater part remains a desolate wilderness. It was so described in ancient times (see Joseph. Bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.10. 7, iv. 8. 2), and we find it so to-day (compare v. Raumer, Pal. p. 58). &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is the Dead Sea, called &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>, and the sea of the Arabah in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>. We agree with Hengstenberg in taking the words &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; as an emphatic summing up of the previous statement concerning the outflow of the water, to which the explanation concerning its effect upon the Dead Sea is attached, and supply &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; from the clause immediately preceding: "the waters of the river that have been brought out (come) to the sea, and the waters of the Dead Sea are healed." There is no need, therefore, for the emendation proposed by Hitzig, namely, &#1488;&#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;. So much, however, is beyond all doubt, that &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is no other than the Dead Sea already mentioned. The supposition that it is the Mediterranean Sea (Chald., Ros., Ewald, and others) cannot be reconciled with the words, and has only been transferred to this passage from <a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>. &#1504;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; signifies, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/2-22.htm">2 Kings 2:22</a>, the healing or rendering wholesome of water that is injurious or destructive to life. The character of the Dead Sea, with which the ancients were also well acquainted, and of which Tacitus writes as follows: Lacus immenso ambitu, specie maris sapore corruptior, gravitate odoris accolis pestifer, neque vento impellitur neque pisces aut suetas aquis volucres patitur (Hist. v. c. 6), - a statement confirmed by all modern travellers (cf. v. Raumer, Pal. pp. 61ff., and Robinson, Physical Geography of the Holy Land), - is regarded as a disease of the water, which is healed or turned into wholesome water in which fishes can live, by the water of the river proceeding from the sanctuary. The healing and life-giving effect of this river upon the Dead Sea is described in <a href="/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Ezekiel 47:9</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>. Whithersoever the waters of the river come, all animated beings will come to life and flourish.<p>In <a href="/ezekiel/47-9.htm">Ezekiel 47:9</a> the dual &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; occasions some difficulty. It is not likely that the dual should have been used merely for the sake of its resemblance to &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, as Maurer imagines; and still less probable is it that there is any allusion to a junction of the river proceeding from the temple at some point in its course with the Kedron, which also flows into the Dead Sea (Hvernick), as the Kedron is not mentioned either before or afterwards. According to Kliefoth, the dual is intended to indicate a division which takes place in the waters of the river, that have hitherto flowed on together, as soon as they enter the sea. But this would certainly have been expressed more clearly. Hengstenberg takes the expression "double river" to mean a river with a strong current, and refers to <a href="/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21</a> in support of this. This is probably the best explanation; for nothing is gained by altering the text into &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1501; (Ewald) or &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (Hitzig), as &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; does not require definition by means of a suffix, nor doe the plural answer to the context.  is to be taken in connection with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;: "wherewith it swarms whithersoever the river comes;" though &#1488;&#1500; does not stand for &#1506;&#1500; after <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21</a>, as Hitzig supposes, but is to be explained from a species of attraction, as in <a href="/genesis/20-13.htm">Genesis 20:13</a>. &#1497;&#1495;&#1497;&#1492; is a pregnant expression, to revive, to come to life. The words are not to be understood, however, as meaning that there were living creatures in the Dead Sea before the health-giving water flowed into it; the thought is simply, that whithersoever the waters of the river come, there come into existence living creatures in the Dead Sea, so that it swarms with them. In addition to the &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, the quantity of fish is specially mentioned; and in the second hemistich the reason is assigned for the number of living creatures that come into existence by a second allusion to the health-giving power of the water of the river. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, viz., the waters of the Dead Sea, is to be supplied from the context. The great abundance of fish in the Dead Sea produced by the river is still further depicted in <a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>. Fishermen will spread their nets along its coast from Engedi to Eneglaim; and as for their kind, there will be as many kinds of fish there as are to be found in the great or Mediterranean Sea. &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, i.e., Goat's spring, now Ain-Jidi, a spring in the middle of the west coast of the Dead Sea, with ruins of several ancient buildings (see the comm. on <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-62.htm">Joshua 15:62</a>, and v. Raumer, Pal. p. 188). &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; has not yet been discovered, though, from the statement of Jerome, "Engallim is at the beginning of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan enters it," it has been conjectured that it is to be found in Ain el-Feshkhah, a spring at the northern end of the west coast, where there are also ruins of a small square tower and other buildings to be seen (vid., Robinson's Palestine, II pp. 491, 492), as none of the other springs on the west coast, of which there are but few, answer so well as this. &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is pointed without Mappik, probably because the Masoretes did not regard the &#1492; as a suffix, as the noun to which it alludes does not follow till afterwards. - <a href="/ezekiel/47-11.htm">Ezekiel 47:11</a> introduces an exception, namely, that notwithstanding this the Dead Sea will still retain marshes or pools and swamps, which will not be made wholesome (&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, pools). An allusion to the natural character of the Dead Sea underlies the words. "In the rainy season, when the sea is full, its waters overspread many low tracts of marsh land, which remain after the receding of the water in the form of moist pools or basins; and as the water in these pools evaporates rapidly, the ground becomes covered with a thick crust of salt" (Robinson's Physical Geography, p. 215). &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1495; &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, they are given up to salt, i.e., destined to remain salt, because the waters of the river do not reach them. The light in which the salt is regarded here is not that of its seasoning properties, but, in the words of Hengstenberg, "as the foe to all fruitfulness, all life and prosperity, as Pliny has said (Hist. Nat. xxxi. c. 7: Omnis locus, in quo reperitur sal, sterilis est nihilque gignit") (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>). - In <a href="/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a> the effect of the water of the river upon the vegetation of the ground, already mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a>, is still further described. On its coast grow all kinds of trees with edible fruits (&#1506;&#1509; &#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, as in <a href="/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>), whose leaves do not wither, and whose fruits do not fail, but ripen every month (&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, or produce first-fruits, i.e., fresh fruits; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; distributive, as in <a href="/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a>), because the waters which moisten the soil proceed from the sanctuary, i.e., "directly and immediately from the dwelling-place of Him who is the author of all vital power and fruitfulness" (Hitzig). The leaves and fruits of these trees therefore possess supernatural powers. The fruits serve as food, i.e., for the maintenance of the life produced by the river of water; the leaves as medicine (&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; from &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;  equals  &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, healing), i.e., for the healing of the sick and corrupt (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>).<p>In the effect of the water proceeding from the sanctuary upon the Dead Sea and the land on its shores, as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8-12</a>, the significance of this stream of water in relation to the new kingdom of God is implied. If, then, the question be asked, what we are to understand by this water, whether we are to take it in a literal sense as the temple spring, or in a spiritual and symbolical sense, the complete answer can only be given in connection with the interpretation of the whole of the temple vision (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>). Even if we assume for the moment, however, that the description of the new temple, with the worship appointed for it, and the fresh division of Canaan, is to be understood literally, and therefore that the building of an earthly temple upon a high mountain in the most holy terumah of the land set apart for Jehovah, and a renewal of the bleeding sacrifices in this temple by the twelve tribes of Israel, when restored to Palestine from the heathen lands, are to be taken for granted, it would be difficult to combine with this a literal interpretation of what is said concerning the effect of the temple spring. It is true that in Volck's opinion "we are to think of a glorification of nature;" but even this does not remove the difficulties which stand in the way of a literal interpretation of the temple spring. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>, its waters posses the life-giving and healing power ascribed to them because they issue from the sanctuary. But how does the possession by the water of the power to effect the glorification of nature harmonize with its issuing from a temple in which bullocks, rams, calves, and goats are slaughtered and sacrificed? - Volck is still further of opinion that, with the spiritual interpretation of the temple spring, "nothing at all could be made of the fishermen;" because, for example, he cannot conceive of the spiritual interpretation in any other way than as an allegorical translation of all the separate features of the prophetic picture into spiritual things. But he has failed to consider that the fishermen with their nets on the shore of the sea, once dead, but now swarming with fish, are irreconcilably opposed to the assumption of a glorification of nature in the holy land, just because the inhabitants of the globe or holy land, in its paradisaically glorified state, will no more eat fish or other flesh, according to the teaching of Scripture, than the first men in Paradise. When once the wolf shall feed with the lamb, the leopard with the kid, the cow with the bear, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, under the sceptre of the sprout from the stem of Jesse, then will men also cease their fishing, and no longer slaughter and eat either oxen or goats. To this the Israelites will form no exception in their glorified land of Canaan. - And if even these features in the vision before us decidedly favour the figurative or spiritual view of the temple spring, the necessity for this explanation is placed beyond the reach of doubt by a comparison of our picture with the parallel passages. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/4-18.htm">Joel 4:18</a>, at the time when a spring issues from the house of Jehovah and the vale of Shittim is watered, the mountains trickle with new wine, and the hills run with milk. If, then, in this case we understand what is affirmed of the temple spring literally, the trickling of the mountains with new wine and the flowing of the hills with milk must be taken literally as well. But we are unable to attain to the belief that in the glorified land of Israel the mountains will be turned into springs of new wine, and the hills into fountains of milk, and in the words of the whole verse we can discern nothing but a figurative description of the abundant streams of blessing which will then pour over the entire land. And just as in Joel the context points indisputably to a non-literal or figurative explanation, so also does the free manner in which Zechariah uses this prophecy of his predecessors, speaking only of living waters which issue from Jerusalem, and flow half into the eastern (i.e., the Dead) sea, and half into the western (i.e., the Mediterranean) sea (<a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>), show that he was not thinking of an actual spring with earthly water. And here we are still provisionally passing by the application made of this feature in the prophetic descriptions of the glory of the new kingdom of God in the picture of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>).<p>The figurative interpretation, or spiritual explanation, is moreover favoured by the analogy of the Scriptures. "Water," which renders the unfruitful land fertile, and supplies refreshing drink to the thirsty, is used in Scripture as a figure denoting blessing and salvation, which had been represented even in Paradise in the form of watering (cf. <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>, "and with joy ye draw water from the wells of salvation," the figure is expressly interpreted. And so also in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, "I will pour water upon the thirsty one, and streams upon the desert; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:" where the blessing answers to the water, the Spirit is named as the principal form in which the blessing is manifested, "the foundation of all other salvation for the people of God" (Hengstenberg). This salvation, which Joel had already described as a spring issuing from the house of Jehovah and watering the dry acacia valley, Ezekiel saw in a visionary embodiment as water, which sprang from under the threshold of the temple into which the glory of the Lord entered, and had swollen at a short distance off into so mighty a river that it was no longer possible to wade through. In this way the thought is symbolized, that the salvation which the Lord causes to flow down to His people from His throne will pour down from small beginnings in marvellously increasing fulness. The river flows on into the barren, desolate waste of the Ghor, and finally into the Dead Sea, and makes the waters thereof sound, so that it swarms with fishes. The waste is a figure denoting the spiritual drought and desolation, and the Dead Sea a symbol of the death caused by sin. The healing and quickening of the salt waters of that sea, so fatal to all life, set forth the power of that divine salvation which conquers death, and the calling to life of the world sunk in spiritual death. From this comes life in its creative fulness and manifold variety, as shown both by the figure of the fishermen who spread their nets along the shore, and by the reference to the kinds of fish, which are as manifold in their variety as those in the great sea. But life extends no further than the water of salvation flows. Wherever it cannot reach, the world continues to life in death. The pools and swamps of the Dead Sea are still given up to salt. And lastly, the water of salvation also possesses the power to produce trees with leaves and fruits, by which the life called forth from death can be sustained and cured of all diseases. This is the meaning, according to the express statement of the text, of the trees with their never withering leaves, upon the banks of the river, and their fruits ripening every month. </body></html>
