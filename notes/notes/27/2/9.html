Or, as some think, this may be spoken of the wise men framing excuses, in order to delay their punishment, in hopes there might be some change in things, or in the king’s mind, whereby they might escape it.

We know not the uneasiness of many who live in great pomp, and, as others vainly think, in pleasure also. The king said that his learned men must tell him the dream itself, or they should all be put to death as deceivers. Men are more eager to ask as to future events, than to learn the way of salvation or the path of duty; yet foreknowledge of future events increases anxiety and trouble. Those who deceived, by pretending to do what they could not do, were sentenced to death, for not being able to do what they did not pretend to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you - That is, you shall share the same fate.

It seems to have been supposed that the responsibility rested on them individually as well as collectively, and that it would be right to hold each and every one of them bound to explain the matter. As no difference of obligation was recognized, there would be no difference of criminality. It should be said, however, that there is a difference of interpretation here. Gesenius, and some others, render the word translated "decree" - &#1491;&#1514;  da&#770;th - "counsel, plan, purpose," and suppose that it means, "this only is your counsel, or plan;" that is, to prepare lying words, and to gain time. So Prof. Stuart renders the verse, "If ye will not make known to me the dream, one thing is your purpose, both a false and deceitful word have ye agreed to utter before me, until the time shall have changed; therefore tell me the dream, and then I shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof." The original word, however, is most commonly used in the sense of law or decree.

There does not appear to have been any great confidence or affection on either side. The king suspected that they were influenced by bad motives, and they certainly had no strong reasons for attachment to him.

This is the rendering of the Septuagint. Theodotion and Jerome render the first word, which is really the relative, as "therefore," e<span class="accented">rgo</span>, "then," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>. The Peshitta has <span class="accented">den</span>, the corresponding Syriac phrase, which has a similar <span class="accented">sense</span> to that assumed here. The rendering of the next clause, both in the Septuagint and in the version of Theodotion, differs considerably from the Massoretic text. The rendering of the Septuagint is as follows: "If ye do not truly tell me the dream, an,l show me the interpretation, ye shall die." The version of Theodotion is shorter, "It, then, ye will not tell me the dream." Theodotion thus omits the clause translated, "there is <span class="accented">but one decree for you</span>;" the only word that may be the remains of it is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;</span>, or simply the participle, The Syriac is, "If ye will not declare the dream to me, one is your plan and your word." The text of the Septuagint in this case indicates that we have here additions from previous verses. The phrase, "and declare to me the interpretation," is evidently supplied from ver. 5, whereas "ye shall die." literally, "ye shall chance to (fall into) death," has a different origin. This phrase has all the appearance of a translation. It would seem applicable on the idea that in the text before the Septuagint  translator, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">datheon</span>), "your decree," there stood <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">motheon</span>), "your death," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>) being omitted, and possibly the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> (be), and <span class="accented">milch</span> being read into some part of <span class="accented">nephal</span>, "to fall," probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">tippelun</span>). The omission of this clause, as above mentioned, from Theodotion renders it a little doubtful, as it indicates that in the text used by the Jews of Asia Minor this phrase was awanting. Most commentators take <span class="accented">dath</span> in the sense more common in Eastern than in Western Aramaic, of "pica" rather than "decree" Ewald and Professor Bevan oppose this view, as also Keil, the last with great positiveness. The facts that so many commentators give this meaning, and that certain Rabbinic authorities reterred to but not named by Jephet-ibn-Ali prove it to be no impossible translation. Hitzig, Von Lengerke, Maurer, Michaelis, and Moses Stuart are not quite despicable. The main reason against this view is that in Western Aramaic <span class="accented">dath</span> means "decree," in Eastern Aramaic it means, according to Castell, <span class="accented">scopus</span>, <span class="accented">meta</span>, <span class="accented">finis</span>, <span class="accented">voluntas.</span> The only difficulty is that he gives no reference, and Brockel-mann gives only <span class="accented">lex</span>, which in this case it cannot be, though this is the only reference beside Hoffmann's 'Glossary.' It might be an individual "decree," but a "law" it cannot be. On the received renderings the succession is somewhat violent. "If ye will not tell me the dream, one is your decree," can only be made consecutive by a violent jerk away back to the fifth verse. It seems more natural to take it as meaning, "Ye have agreed together to say one thing to me." The accusation of conspiracy naturally followed from the king's firm conviction that the soothsayers could tell, if they only would, what he required of them. If there began to dawn upon him any idea that their silence was due to inability to answer, it might well move him to redoubled anger that they had been guilty of imposture in claiming such lofty powers and being so highly paid and honoured for their exercise. The king's mind had not yet abandoned the faith of his fathers in magic and divination. For ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me. It' the Septuagint is to be taken as our guide, the word <span class="accented">shheethah</span> is a doubtful addition to the Massoretic text It is, however, in the other later versions. According to the rendering of both the Greek versions, the meaning here is stronger than that which is expressed in the Authorized Version; <span class="accented">hizdaminton</span> really means "to conspire." He will not admit the plea of inability to satisfy his demands - the vague suspicion may be floating before his mind - as, if he were to admit their inability to satisfy what he wished to learn, then, according to his logic, all their claims were false. Hence the accusation of "lying and corrupt words" would still stand, and have all the greater emphasis. Waiving the question of the authenticity of "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," the distinction between the two words "<span class="accented">lying"</span> and "corrupt" seems to be in this: the first refers to the person addressed  - to Nebuchadnezzar, - the words are untrue, they are lies - as coming from the soothsayers they are "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," because they are symptomatic of a corrupt disposition, probably traitor, us. Till the time be changed. Theodotion renders here. "till the time be passed." The Septuagint follows a similar reading to that in the Massoretic text. The Peshitta rendering is akin to that of Theodotion. While in all forms of magic and soothsaying, time was an element not to be neglected, it was doubly important in regard to astrology, and an hour or two changed the position of the moon in relation to the constellations. If something required to be clone in consequence of this dream, then most likely it would require to be done in a certain relation of the heavenly bodies to each other. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. The Septuagint rendering is paraphrastic, "Now then, if ye tell me the thing which I saw in the night, I shall know that ye can also show the interpretation." While we have called it a paraphrase as regards the Massoretic text, the rendering in the Septuagint may represent the Egyptian recension of the text of Daniel. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or "thing" suggests translation, and assumes <span class="accented">millah</span> or <span class="accented">mill'tha</span>, which has the same double suggestion of "word spoken" and "thing spoken about." If the Septuagint text were assumed here, we should have confirmation of our view that Nebuchadnezzar remembered his vision, but was determined to experiment on the soothsayers of his court. This view is certainly implied in the following clause. The first word of this clause is peculiar grammatically: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">in'd'a</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">iyda</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('idda). This form of compensating for a dropped consonant by inserting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> (<span class="accented">nun</span>) instead of doubling occurs elsewhere in Biblical Aramaic (see ver. 30). This is rare in Syriac, and in the Targums found only in those later, especially those of the Megilloth, which have affinities with the form of Aramaic seen in the Babylonian Talmud. This peculiarity is common in the Maudaitic dialect. It is thus a distinctively Eastern form of Aramaic that is indicated here. When we pass beyond the grammatical elements, we find that Nebuchadnezzar would take correct information  as to what he had dreamed a guarantee of the correctness of the interpretation of the dream which the soothsayers might afterwards give him. His attitude was purely and truly scientific, as it is stated. In his own mind he was warped and confused by his overmastering belief in omens and auguries, in gods and demons, in magicians and astrologers. With this faith in his heart, his only explanation of the silence of these soothsayers was treason. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Sin-Offerings in the First Month<p><a href="/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, In the first (month), on the first of the month, thou shalt take a bullock, a young ox without blemish, and absolve the sanctuary. <a href="/ezekiel/45-19.htm">Ezekiel 45:19</a>. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the enclosure of the altar, and upon the door-posts at the gate of the inner court. <a href="/ezekiel/45-20.htm">Ezekiel 45:20</a>. And so shalt thou do on the seventh of the month, for the sake of erring men and of folly, that so ye may make atonement for the house. - The Mosaic law had prescribed for the new moons generally the sin-offering of a he-goat, in addition to the burnt-offerings and meat-offerings (<a href="/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15</a>); and, besides, this, had also distinguished the new-moon's day of the seventh month by a special feast-offering to be added to the regular new-moon's sacrifices, and consisting of a sin-offering of a he-goat, and burnt-offerings and meat-offerings (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). This distinguishing of the seventh month by a special new-moon's sacrifice is omitted in Ezekiel; but in the place of it the first month is distinguished by a sin-offering to be presented on the first and seventh days. Nothing is said in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18-20</a> about burnt-offerings for these days; but as the burnt-offering is appointed in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6-7</a> for the new-moon's day without any limitation, and the regulations as to the connection between the meat-offering and the burnt-offerings are repeated in <a href="/ezekiel/46-11.htm">Ezekiel 46:11</a> for the holy days and feast days (&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;) generally, and the new-moon's day is also reckoned among the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, there is evidently good ground for the assumption that the burnt-offering and meat-offering prescribed for the new moon in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6-7</a> were also to be offered at the new moon of the first month. On the other hand, no special burnt-offering or meat-offering is mentioned for the seventh day of the first month; so that in all probability only the daily burnt-offering and meat-offering were added upon that day (<a href="/ezekiel/46-13.htm">Ezekiel 46:13</a>.) to the sin-offering appointed for it. Moreover, the sin-offerings prescribed for the first and seventh days of the first month are distinguished from the sin-offerings of the Mosaic law, partly by the animal selected (a young bullock), and partly by the disposal of the blood. According to the Mosaic law, the sin-offering for the new moons, as well as for all the feast days of the year, the Passover, Pentecost, day of trumpets, day of atonement, and feast of tabernacles (all eight days), was to be a he-goat (<a href="/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-30.htm">Numbers 22:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-5.htm">Numbers 29:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-11.htm">Numbers 29:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-16.htm">Numbers 29:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-19.htm">Numbers 29:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-22.htm">Numbers 29:22</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-25.htm">Numbers 29:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-28.htm">Numbers 29:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-31.htm">Numbers 29:31</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/29-34.htm">Numbers 29:34</a>, <a href="/numbers/29-38.htm">Numbers 29:38</a>). Even the sin-offering for the congregation of Israel on the great day of atonement simply consisted in a he-goat (or two he-goats, <a href="/leviticus/16-5.htm">Leviticus 16:5</a>); and it was only for the sin-offering for the high priest, whether on that day (<a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm">Leviticus 16:3</a>), or when he had sinned so as to bring guilt upon the nation (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>), or when the whole congregation had sinned (<a href="/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a>), that a bullock was required. On the other hand, according to Ezekiel, the sin-offering both on the first and seventh days of the first month, and also the one to be brought by the prince on the fourteenth day of that month, i.e., on the day of the feast of Passover (<a href="/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>), for himself and for all the people, were to consist of a bullock and only the sin-offering on the seven days of the feast of Passover and tabernacles of a he-goat (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-23.htm">Ezekiel 45:23</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/45-25.htm">Ezekiel 45:25</a>). The Mosaic law contains no express instructions concerning the sprinkling of the blood of the sin-offering at the new moons and feasts (with the exception of the great atoning sacrifice on the day of atonement), because it was probably the same as in the case of the sin-offerings for the high priest and the whole congregation, when the blood was first of all to be sprinkled seven times against the curtain in front of the capporeth, and then to be applied to the horns of the altar of incense, and the remainder to be poured out at the foot of the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6-7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/4-17.htm">Leviticus 4:17-18</a>); whereas, in the case of the great atoning sacrifice on the day of atonement, some of the blood was first of all to be sprinkled at or upon the front side of the capporeth and seven times upon the ground, and after that it was to be applied to the horns of the altar of incense and of the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/16-15.htm">Leviticus 16:15-17</a>). But according to Ezekiel, some of the blood of the sin-offerings on the first and seventh days of the first month, and certainly also on the same days of the feasts of Passover and tabernacles, was to be smeared upon the posts of the house - that is to say, the posts mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-21.htm">Ezekiel 41:21</a>, not merely those of the &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the door into the holy place, but also those of the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, the door leading into the most holy place, upon the horns and the four corners of the enclosure of the altar of burnt-offering (<a href="/ezekiel/43-20.htm">Ezekiel 43:20</a>), and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. It is a point in dispute here whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1492;&#1495;&#1510;&#1512; is only one door, and in that case whether the east gate of the inner court is to be understood as in <a href="/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a> (&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;), as Hitzig and others suppose, or whether &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; rehtehw  is to be taken in a collective sense as signifying the three gates of the inner court (Kliefoth and others). The latter view is favoured by the collective use of the word &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; by itself, and also by the circumstance that if only one of the three gates were intended, the statement which of the three would hardly have been omitted (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, etc.).<p>According to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a>, these sin-offerings were to serve for the absolving of the sanctuary; and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-20.htm">Ezekiel 45:20</a>, to make atonement for the temple on account of error or folly. Both directions mean the same thing. The reconciliation of the temple was effected by its absolution or purification from the sins that had come upon it through the error and folly of the people. Sins &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;&#1492; are sins occasioned by the weakness of flesh and blood, for which expiation could be made by sin-offerings (see the comm. on <a href="/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a> and <a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>.). &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1492;, lit., away from the erring man, i.e., to release him from his sin. This expression is strengthened by &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, away from simplicity or folly; here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>, as abstractum pro concreto, the simple man. - The great expiatory sacrifice on the day of atonement answered the same purpose, the absolution of the sanctuary from the sins of the people committed &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1490;&#1492; (<a href="/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>.). </body></html>
