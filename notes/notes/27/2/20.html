The Doxology, with which it commences, is founded upon the liturgical formula concluding Psalms 41, the substance of it being repeated by Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/9-5.htm" title="Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.">Nehemiah 9:5</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-23 Daniel humbly prayed that God would discover to him the king's dream, and the meaning of it. Praying friends are valuable friends; and it well becomes the greatest and best men to desire the prayers of others. Let us show that we value our friends, and their prayers. They were particular in prayer. And whatever we pray for, we can expect nothing but as the gift of God's mercies. God gives us leave in prayer to tell our wants and burdens. Their plea with God was, the peril they were in. The mercy Daniel and his fellows prayed for, was bestowed. The fervent prayers of righteous men avail much. Daniel was thankful to God for making known that to him, which saved the lives of himself and his fellows. How much more should we be thankful to God, for making known the great salvation of the soul to those who are not among the worldly wise and prudent!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Daniel answered and said - The word "answer," in the Scriptures, often occurs substantially in the sense of "speak" or "say." It does not always denote a reply to something that has been said by another, as it does with us, but is often used when a speech is commenced, as if one were replying to something that "might" be said in the case, or as meaning that the circumstances in the case gave rise to the remark. Here the meaning is, that Daniel responded, as it were, to the goodness which God had manifested, and gave utterance to his feelings in appropriate expressions of praise.<p>Blessed be the name of God forever and ever - That is, blessed be God - the "name," in the Scriptures, being often used to denote the person himself. It is common in the Bible to utter ascriptions of praise to God in view of important revelations, or in view of great mercies. Compare the song of Moses after the passage of the Red Sea, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>; the song of Deborah after the overthrow of Sisera, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1-6</a>.<p>For wisdom, and might are his - Both these were manifested in a remarkable manner in the circumstances of this case, and therefore these were the beginnings of the song of praise: "wisdom," as now imparted to Daniel, enabling him to disclose this secret, when all human skill had failed; and "might," as about to be evinced in the changes of empire indicated by the dream and the interpretation.

The fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">min'alma</span>), "from eternity," is not rendered in this version, and that the adjective "great" is added in its place, indicates a difference of reading. Probably there was a transposition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5da;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span> and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5df;</span> omitted.

Theodotion differs somewhat more from the Massoretic text than is his custom, "And he said, Be the Name of God blessed from eternity to eternity, for (the) wisdom and (the) understanding are his." This is shorter; the omission of the pleonastic formula, "answered and said," has an appearance of genuineness that is impressive. It would seem as if Theodotion had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">beenetha</span>), "<span class="accented">understanding</span>," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">geboorah</span>), "might." The Peshitta and the Vulgate do not differ from the Massoretic text. The first, word of the Hebrew text of this song of thanksgiving has an interest for us, as throwing light on the question of the original language, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> has the appearance of an infinitive, but it is the third person plural of the imperfect; <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> is here the preformative of the third person singular and plural as in Eastern Aramaic as distinct from Western. This preformative is found occasionally in the Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, along with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, the preformative we find regularly in Syriac. In Biblical Aramaic this pre-formative is found only with the substantive verb; the reason of this, however, we have considered in regard to the language (see Introduction, p. 23.). Suffice it that we regard this as an evidence that Daniel was originally written in Eastern Aramaic. Professor Bevan's explanation, that the phenomenon is due to the likeness these parts of this verb have to the Divine Name, is of force to afford a reason why, in the midst of the general process of Occidentalizing the Aramaic, they shrank from applying it to this verb. That they had no scruple in writing it first hand, we find in the Targums; thus Onkelos, <a href="/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>. We might refer to ether examples in the later Aramaic of the Talmud and other Rabbinic works. <span class="accented">The Name of God.</span> Later Judaism, to avoid using the sacred covenant name of God, was accustomed to use the "Name," in this sense. This may be noted that throughout this whole book, "Jehovah" occurs only in ch. 9. This may  be due to something of that reverence which has led the Jews for centuries to avoid pronouncing the sacred name, and to use instead, <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, "Lord." It is to be observed that all through Daniel the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the Greek equivalent for <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, while Theodotion follows the Massoretic in having <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. For <span class="accented">ever and ever.</span> This is not an accurate translation, although it appears not only in the Authorized, but also in the Revised Version. The sound of the phrase impresses us with a sense of grandeur, perhaps due to the music with which it has been associated. When we think of the meaning we really give to the phrase, or of its actual grammatical sense, it only conveys to us the idea of unending future duration; it does not at all imply unbeginning duration. More correct is Luther's "veto Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit." The Greek of Theodotion conveys this also, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Jerome renders, "a saeculo et usque in saeculum." The true rendering is, "from eternity to eternity." It is quite true that the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> means primarily "an age," as does also <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="accented">saculum</span>: it is also quite true that it is improbable that in ancient days man had definite ideas of eternity; even at the present time, when men strive after definiteness, they have no real conception of unending existence, still less of existence unbeginning. Still, it was used as having that meaning so far as men were able to apprehend it. As <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, it is used for "world." <span class="accented">For wisdom and wight are his.</span> Wisdom is the Divine quality of which they have had proof now, but "might" is united with it as really one in thought. The fact that the usual combination is "wisdom and understanding" (see <a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/28-4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4</a>) has led the scribe, whose text Theodotion used, to replace "might" by "understanding." He might feel himself confirmed in his emendation by the fact that, while God's wisdom and, it might be said, his understanding were exhibited in thus revealing to Daniel the royal dream, there was no place for "might." What was in the mind of Daniel and his friends was that they were in the hands of a great Monarch, who was practically omnipotent. They now make known their recognition of the glorious truth that not only does the wisdom of the wise belong to God, but also the might of the strong. Further, there is another thought here which is present in all Scripture - that wisdom and might are really two sides of one and the same thing; hence a truth is proved by a miracle, a work of power. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/46.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Sacrifices for the Sabbath and New Moon<p>As, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>, it devolved upon the prince to provide and bring the sacrifices for himself and the house of Israel; after the appointment of the sacrifices to be offered at the yearly feasts (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18-25</a>), and before the regulation of the sacrifices for the Sabbath and new moon (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4-7</a>), directions are given as to the conduct of the prince at the offering of these sacrifices (<a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-3</a>).

The prince was to enter this inner east gate, and to stand there and worship upon the threshold while his sacrifice was being prepared and offered. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; is to be taken as in <a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>; but &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, which is appended, is not to be referred to the entrance into the inner court, as the statement would be quite superfluous so far as this is concerned, since any one who was not already in the inner court must enter the gate-building of the inner court from without, or from the outer court. The meaning of &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; is rather that the prince was to enter, or to go to, the gate porch of the inner court through the outer east gate. There he was to stand at the posts of the gate and worship on the threshold of the gate during the sacrificial ceremony; and when this was over he was to go out again, namely, by the same way by which he entered (<a href="/ezekiel/44-3.htm">Ezekiel 44:3</a>). But the people who came to the temple on the Sabbaths and new moons were to worship &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;, i.e., at the entrance of this gate, outside the threshold of the gate. Kliefoth in wrong in taking &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; in the sense of through the doorway, as signifying that the people were to remain in front of the outer east gate, and to worship looking at the temple through this gate and through the open gate between.

There is no force in the consideration which has led Kliefoth to overlook &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, and think of the outer gate, namely, that "it would be unnatural to suppose that the people were to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, whilst the outer east gate remained shut (or perhaps more correctly, was opened for the prince), and so stand in front of the inner court," as it is impossible to see what there is that is unnatural in such a supposition. On the other hand, it is unnatural to assume that the people, who, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-9.htm">Ezekiel 46:9</a>, were to come through the north and south gates into the outer court at all the &#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; to appear before Jehovah, were not allowed to enter the court upon the Sabbaths and new moons if they should wish to worship before Jehovah upon these days also, but were to stand outside before the gate of the outer court. The difference between the princes and the people, with regard to visiting the temple upon the Sabbaths and new moons, consisted chiefly in this, that the prince could enter by the outer east gate and proceed as far as the posts of the middle gate, and there worship upon the threshold of the gate, whereas the people were only allowed to come into the outer court through the outer north and south gates, and could only proceed to the front of the middle gate. - <a href="/ezekiel/46-4.htm">Ezekiel 46:4</a>. The burnt-offering for the Sabbath is considerably increased when compared with that appointed in the Mosaic law. The law requires two yearling lambs with the corresponding meat-offering (<a href="/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>); Ezekiel, six lambs and one ram, and in addition to these a meat-offering for the ram according to the proportion already laid down in <a href="/ezekiel/45-24.htm">Ezekiel 45:24</a> for the festal sacrifices; and for the lambs, &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, a gift, a present of his hand, - that is to say, not a handful of meal, but, according to the formula used in alternation with it in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>, as much as his hand can afford. For &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; , see <a href="/leviticus/14-30.htm">Leviticus 14:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-26.htm">Leviticus 25:26</a>. - It is different with the sacrifices of the new moon in <a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/46-7.htm">Ezekiel 46:7</a>. The law of Moses prescribed two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, with the corresponding meat-offering, and a he-goat for a sin-offering (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>); the thorah of Ezekiel, on the contrary, omits the sin-offering, and reduces the burnt-offering to one bullock, one ram, and six lambs, together with a meat-offering, according to the proportion already mentioned, which is peculiar to his law. The first &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a> is a copyist's error for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
