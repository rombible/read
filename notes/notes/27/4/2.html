After he was recovered from his madness, he told to distant places, and wrote down for future ages, how God had justly humbled and graciously restored him. When a sinner comes to himself, he will promote the welfare of others, by making known the wondrous mercy of God. Nebuchadnezzar, before he related the Divine judgments upon him for his pride, told the warnings he had in a dream or vision. The meaning was explained to him. The person signified, was to be put down from honour, and to be deprived of the use of his reason seven years. This is surely the sorest of all temporal judgments. Whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, we have cause to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he continues the use of our reason, and the peace of our consciences. Yet if the Lord should see fit by such means to keep a sinner from multiplying crimes, or a believer from dishonouring his name, even the dreadful prevention would be far preferable to the evil conduct. God has determined it, as a righteous Judge, and the angels in heaven applaud. Not that the great God needs the counsel or concurrence of the angels, but it denotes the solemnity of this sentence. The demand is by the word of the holy ones, God's suffering people: when the oppressed cry to God, he will hear. Let us diligently seek blessings which can never be taken from us, and especially beware of pride and forgetfulness of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I thought it good - Margin, "it was seemly before me." The marginal reading is more in accordance with the original (&#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;  shephar qa&#770;da&#770;may). The proper meaning of the Chaldee word (&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1512;  shephar) is, to be fair or beautiful; and the sense here is, that it seemed to him to be appropriate or becoming to make this public proclamation. It was fit and right that what God had done to him should be proclaimed to all nations.<p>To show the signs and wonders - Signs and wonders, as denoting mighty miracles, are not unfrequently connected in the Scriptures. See <a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-11.htm">Deuteronomy 34:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a>. The word rendered "signs" (Hebrew: &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;  'o&#770;th - Chaldee: &#1488;&#1514;  'a&#770;th) means, properly, "a sign," as something significant, or something that points out or designates anything; as <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>, "shall be for "signs" and for seasons;" that is, signs of seasons. Then the word denotes an ensign, a military flag, <a href="/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>; then a sign of something past, a token or remembrancer, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>, <a href="/exodus/13-16.htm">Exodus 13:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; then a sign of something future, a portent, an omen, <a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>; then a sign or token of what is visible, as circumcision, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>, or the rainbow in the cloud, as a token of the covenant which God made with man, <a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12</a>; then anything which serves as a sign or proof of the fulfillment of prophecy, <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a>; and then it refers to anything which is a sign or proof of Divine power, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-19.htm">Deuteronomy 7:19</a>, "et al."<p>The Hebrew word is commonly rendered "signs," but it is also rendered "token, ensign, miracles." As applied to what God does, it seems to be used in the sense of anything that is significant of his presence and power; anything that shall manifestly show that, what occurs is done by him; anything that is beyond human ability, and that makes known the being and the perfections of God by a direct and extraordinary manifestation. Here the meaning is, that what was done in so remarkable a manner was significant of the agency of God; it was what demonstrated that he exists, and that showed his greatness. The word rendered "wonders" (&#1514;&#1502;&#1492;  temahh) means, properly, what is fitted to produce astonishment, or to lead one to wonder, and is applied to miracles as adapted to produce that effect. It refers to that state of mind which exists where anything occurs out of the ordinary course of nature, or which indicates supernatural power. The Hebrew word rendered "wonders" is often used to denote miracles, <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/11-9.htm">Exodus 11:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>, "et al." The meaning here is, that what had occurred was fitted to excite amazement, and to lead men to wonder at the mighty works of God.<p>That the high God - The God who is exalted, or lifted up; that is, the God who is above all. See <a href="/daniel/3-26.htm">Daniel 3:26</a>. It is an appellation which would be given to God as the Supreme Being. The Greek translation of this verse is, "And now I show unto you the deeds - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  praxeis - which the great God has done unto me, for it seemed good to me to show to you and your wise men" - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  tois sophistais humo&#772;n. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

They are in close agreement with the Massoretic text. In these two verses the Peshitta is also at one with the Massoretic text. It is possible that this may have been the actual beginning of the document; on the other hand, it may have been simply the suggestion of some later scribe of how such a proclamation might have begun. The latter is, perhaps, the more probable. At the same time, it vindicates its position by being a not unnatural expression of feelings such as Nebuchadnezzar might well be supposed to have had after such an experience as he had passed through. It may even be that the signs and wonders to which Nebuchadnezzar refers are not merely those of his dream and its fulfilment, but all the signs that had been manifested in his reign. </body></html>
