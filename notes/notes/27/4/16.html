It is more probable that the word is used to signify some definite period of time, which, as appears from the words “over him,” was in some way marked out by the heavenly bodies. The word “time” is used by Daniel in the same sense (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>).

After he was recovered from his madness, he told to distant places, and wrote down for future ages, how God had justly humbled and graciously restored him. When a sinner comes to himself, he will promote the welfare of others, by making known the wondrous mercy of God. Nebuchadnezzar, before he related the Divine judgments upon him for his pride, told the warnings he had in a dream or vision. The meaning was explained to him. The person signified, was to be put down from honour, and to be deprived of the use of his reason seven years. This is surely the sorest of all temporal judgments. Whatever outward affliction God is pleased to lay upon us, we have cause to bear it patiently, and to be thankful that he continues the use of our reason, and the peace of our consciences. Yet if the Lord should see fit by such means to keep a sinner from multiplying crimes, or a believer from dishonouring his name, even the dreadful prevention would be far preferable to the evil conduct. God has determined it, as a righteous Judge, and the angels in heaven applaud. Not that the great God needs the counsel or concurrence of the angels, but it denotes the solemnity of this sentence. The demand is by the word of the holy ones, God's suffering people: when the oppressed cry to God, he will hear. Let us diligently seek blessings which can never be taken from us, and especially beware of pride and forgetfulness of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him - Here the same thing occurs in a more marked form, showing that some man was represented by the vision, and indicating some change which was fitted to attract the deepest attention - as if the person referred to should cease to be a man, and become a beast. The word heart here seems to refer to nature - "let his nature or propensity cease to be that of a man, and become like that of a beast; let him cease to act as a man, and act as the beasts do - evincing as little mind, and living in the same manner."<p>And let seven times pass over him - In this condition, or until he is restored. It is not indeed said that he would be restored, but this is implied<p>(a) in the very expression "until seven times shall pass over him," as if he would then be restored in some way, or as if this condition would then terminate; and<p>(b) in the statement that "the stump of the roots "would be left in the earth as if it might still germinate again.<p>Everything, however, in the dream was fitted to produce perplexity as to what it could mean. The word rendered "times" (&#1506;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;  &#8219;&#305;&#770;dda&#770;n&#305;&#770;yn - singular, &#1506;&#1491;&#1503;  &#8219;idda&#770;n) is an important word in the interpretation of Daniel. It is of the same class of words as the Hebrew &#1497;&#1506;&#1491;  ya&#770;&#8219;ad - to point out, to appoint, to fix; and would refer properly to time considered as "appointed" or "designated;" then it may mean any stated or designated period, as a year. The idea is that of time considered as designated or fixed by periods, and the word may refer to any such period, however long or short - a day, a month, a year, or any other measure of duration. What measurement or portion is intended in any particular case must be determined from the connection in which the word is found. The word used here does not occur in the Hebrew scripture, and is found only in the book of Daniel, where it is uniformly rendered "time" and "times."<p>It is found only in the following places: <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-8.htm">Daniel 2:8</a>, "that ye would gain the time;" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9</a>, "till the time be changed;" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, "and he changeth the times;" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-5.htm">Daniel 3:5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>, "at what time ye shall hear;" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-23.htm">Daniel 4:23</a>, "and let seven times pass over him," <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-25.htm">Daniel 4:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-32.htm">Daniel 4:32</a>, "seven times shall pass over him;" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, "for a season and time;" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>, "until a time and times and the dividing of time." In the place before us, so far as the meaning of the word is concerned, it might mean a day, a week, a month, or a year. The more common interpretation is what supposes that it was a year, and this will agree better with all the circumstances of the case than any other period. The Greek of Theodotion here is: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;  kai  hepta kairoi allage&#772;sontai ep' auton - "And seven times shall change upon him;" that is, until seven seasons revolve over him.<p>The most natural construction of this Greek phrase would be to refer it to years. The Latin Vulgate interprets it in a similar way - et septem tempora mutentur super eum - "And let seven times be changed" or revolve "over him." In the Codex Chisianus it is: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  kai  hepta ete&#772; boske&#772;the&#772; sun autois - "and let him feed with them seven years." Luther renders it "times." Josephus understands by it "seven years." - "Ant." b. x. ch. 10: Section 6. While the Chaldee word is indeterminate in respect to the length of time, the most natural and obvious construction here and elsewhere, in the use of the word, is to refer it to years. Days or weeks would be obviously too short, and though in this place the word "months" would perhaps embrace all that would be necessary, yet in the other places where the word occurs in Daniel it undoubtedly refers to years, and there is, therefore, a propriety in understanding it in the same manner here. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. heart&#8212;understanding (Isa 6:10).<p>times&#8212;that is, "years" (Da 12:7).

Some think that he was truly changed into a beast, but this cannot be, for then the Chaldeans would never more have owned or restored him. Others judge that he was not changed at all but in appearance only to the beholders and in their fancies; but this is a false construction of God’s works, when the Scripture saith it was truly done. It is probable he was mute, and bellowed only, that he went naked, and bowed, and ate grass among the beasts, with whom his converse was: a dreadful example upon the greatest man on earth, for his brutish and raging tyranny, and inhuman carriage, abasing himself, and abusing his honours and great prerogatives to wickedness and savage cruelty, to be thus forsaken of God and men, and to be made a prodigy and spectacle to the world, and that upon record to all generations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let his heart be changed from man's,....

It seems difficult to imagine, either, on the one hand, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">libebayh</span>) changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">pi</span>g<span class="accented">erah</span>), the word by which Paulus Tellensis translates <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, though it suggests "carcase," or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nid nayh</span>), the word used in <a href="/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>; or, on the other, that either of these should be read <span class="accented">lebab.</span> At the same time, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> are not unlike in old inscriptions, nor <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>; any indistinctness in the third letter might easily lead to a mistake. It is not impossible that some of the words in the latter part of the previous verse have been modified from some word meaning "body." It is equally difficult to guess what word has been read by the Septuagint translator instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yah-lephoon</span>), "let them pass over." The greater brevity of the Septuagint is in its favour. Theodotion is, as usual, in closer agreement with the Massoretic; he renders <span class="accented">min-anaosha</span> or <span class="accented">anosha</span>' for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "from men" - a possible translation, and one favoured by some recent commentators. The Peshitta agrees quite with the received text. According to the received text, the main change was mental - the human heart is removed, and the heart of a beast given. On the other hand, in the twenty-third verse, in which we have the fulfilment of the dream, the change is mainly physical, and it is to be observed that the change is produced by "the dew of heaven." <span class="accented">Seven times.</span> The word '<span class="accented">iddanun</span>, "times," is a matter of some difficulty; it means really "seasons" or "points" of time, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>, Targum, and <a href="/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>, Targum Onkelos, "It came to pass at this time." It is purely arbitrary to fix the meaning here as "years," as is done by the Septuagint and by many commentators. Theodotiom keeps the indefinite<span class="accented">ness</span> of the original by rendering the word here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. The Peshitta transfers the word. It may be" months" as suggested by Lenormant; it maybe "seasons," in our usual sense of the word. Rendel Harris's 'Biblical Monuments,' p. 73, says, "Summer and winter are the only seasons counted in Babylonia;" if so, seven '<span class="accented">iddaneen</span> would be nearly four years. From the fact that exposure to weather is the point of importance, Mr. Harris's view is not impossible; but pathological reasons suggest "months" (see Excursus at the end of chapter). <span class="accented">Seven</span>, with the Babylonians, as with most other Semites, is a round number of sacred import, and therefore may not be pressed. </body></html>
