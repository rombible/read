The extent of his dominions may be estimated with tolerable accuracy as follows:—Northwards he possessed Armenia, and a considerable portion of Asia Minor; in the west, Syria, and at one time Egypt; southwards, his power reached the Persian Gulf; while in the east, the Medes and Elamites were subject to him. Possessing, as he did, the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, all the treasures of the known world were at his command. In his first vision he was represented as the golden head of the image. In his pride he desired the whole image to be of gold, and himself to be the image—but this was the sin for which he was to suffer.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:19-27 Daniel was struck with amazement and terror at so heavy a judgment coming upon so great a prince, and gives advice with tenderness and respect. It is necessary, in repentance, that we not only cease to do evil, but learn to do good. Though it might not wholly prevent the judgment, yet the trouble may be longer before it comes, or shorter when it does come. And everlasting misery will be escaped by all who repent and turn to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is thou, O king - It is a representation of thyself.

It is thou&#8212;He speaks pointedly, and without circumlocution (2Sa 12:7). While pitying the king, he uncompromisingly pronounces his sentence of punishment. Let ministers steer the mean between, on the one hand, fulminations against sinners under the pretext of zeal, without any symptom of compassion; and, on the other, flattery of sinners under the pretext of moderation.<p>to the end of the earth&#8212;(Jer 27:6-8).

See Aehmetes of the Language of the East. Now in that he speaks plainly and roundly the whole truth, this prophet is herein a pattern to every faithful minister of Christ; first to preach the truth of God and to apply it without respect of persons, and yet with that wisdom and moderation that men may see they have a compassionate care for their souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven; </span> thou art high and mighty in the majesty and splendour which God hath given thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the end of the earth; </span> say some, to the Caspian Sea north, to the Euxine and Ægean west, to the Mediterranean south, for it is not clear that it reached further, and this alone was great. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is thou, O king, that art grown, and become strong,....
