Since, however, there are no words in the Hebrew for <span class="ital">taken away </span>and <span class="ital">continue, </span>Mr. Wintle rather thinks the inquiry respects only the duration of the vision, and that the other words are by way of explaining what the vision is, namely, “of the daily sacrifice, and of the transgression of desolation, and of the sanctuary and host,” or its attendant ministers, “being suppressed and trampled on.” He therefore translates the clause thus: <span class="ital">How long will be the term of the vision of the daily sacrifice, and the transgression that maketh desolate, exposing both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled on? </span>The plain meaning of the verse is, that one of the angels asked the superior personage, distinguished here by the title of <span class="ital">that certain saint, </span>How long the evils signified in this vision, and particularly the taking away, or interruption, of the daily sacrifice, &c., should last. By the <span class="ital">transgression of desolation </span>seems to be meant the harassing and ravaging of the city by the garrison of Antiochus, setting up an idol to be worshipped in God’s temple, and, by that and other heathenish superstitions, profaning it, and also the host, or the Levites; persuading them, either by threats or enticements, to quit the worship of Jehovah, the true God, or to mix it with the worship of idols, contrary to the divine law. <span class="ital">And he said, Unto two thousand and three hundred days — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">Until the evening </span>[and] <span class="ital">morning two thousand and three hundred. </span>This signifies a space of about six years, and is to be taken from the first invasion of Judea by Antiochus, when he profaned the priesthood, and includes his second coming into that country, when he forbade the worship of God in the temple, and set up an idol there. After this time of two thousand three hundred days, or about six years from the first coming of Antiochus, it is here declared that the temple should be purged, or cleansed from the polluted or unclean things which Antiochus had brought into it, or from those things in it which he had defiled, by using them for idolatrous rites: see 1 Maccabees 4. It must, however, be remembered, that many interpreters understand these days in the same sense in which days are generally understood by this prophet, namely, for <span class="ital">years; </span>and thus refer the prophecy to antichrist, of whom Antiochus was a type. This will carry us on to a still distant time in the church of God, to the completion of that opposition to the church of Christ which has been wished for long since, when the sanctuary will be perfectly cleansed, and to which the twelve hundred ninety and thirteen hundred thirty-five years of chap. 12. must have a reference. Sir Isaac Newton, <span class="ital">Obs., </span>chap. 9., not only reckons the days to be years, but will have the horn to be Rome, and does not refer it at all to Antiochus; and in this he is followed, in a great measure, by Bishop Newton, who makes the years commence from the time of Alexander’s invading Asia, three hundred thirty-four years before Christ, and thus to end with near the sixth millennium of the world. With this interpretation of Bishop Newton, Mr. Faber (a late writer) finds great fault, and endeavours to prove that the Mohammedan delusion, and not that of the Papacy, is intended here by the little horn. His reasonings, calculations, and quotations on this subject, cannot possibly be inserted here, nor even an abstract of them. The reader that wishes to be acquainted with his scheme, must necessarily be referred to the book itself. There seems, however, to be one insuperable objection, both to Bishop Newton’s and this interpretation, and that is, that they are utterly irreconcileable with <a href="/daniel/8-9.htm" title="And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.">Daniel 8:9</a>, where it is expressly said, that this little horn <span class="ital">came forth </span>from one of the <span class="ital">four notable horns, </span>or kingdoms, into which Alexander’s empire was divided. Now it cannot be said that either the Papacy, which arose in the west of Europe, or Mohammedanism, which had its rise and first prevailed in Arabia, sprang from any of the four branches of the Macedonian empire.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-14 God gives Daniel a foresight of the destruction of other kingdoms, which in their day were as powerful as that of Babylon. Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then I heard one saint speaking - One holy one. The vision was now ended, and the prophet represents himself now as hearing earnest inquiries as to the length of time during which this desolation was to continue. This conversation, or these inquiries, he represents himself as hearing among those whom he calls "saints" - or holy ones - &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  qa&#770;do&#770;sh. This word might refer to a saint on earth, or to an angel - to any holy being. As one of these, however, was able to explain the vision, and to tell how long the desolation was to continue, it is more natural to refer it to angels. So Lengerke understands it. The representation is, that one holy one, or angel, was heard by Daniel speaking on this subject, but nothing is recorded of what he said. It is implied only that he was conversing about the desolations that were to come upon the holy city and the people of God. To him thus speaking, and who is introduced as having power to explain it, another holy one approaches, and asks how long this state of things was to continue. The answer to this question <a href="/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a> is made, not to the one who made the inquiry, but to Daniel, evidently that it might be recorded. Daniel does not say where this vision occurred - whether in heaven or on earth. It was so near to him, however, that he could hear what was said.<p>And another saint - Another holy one - probably an angel. If so, we may conclude, what is in itself every way probable, that one angel has more knowledge than another, or that things are communicated to some which are not to others.<p>Unto that certain saint which spake - Margin, Palmoni, or, the numberer of secrets, or, the wondeful numberer. The Hebrew word, &#1508;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;  palemo&#770;n&#305;&#770;y, occurs nowhere else in the Scriptures. The similar form, &#1508;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;  pelon&#305;&#770;y, occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>, "Ho, such a one, turn aside;" in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a>, "appointed my servants to such and such a place;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8</a>, "In such and such a place." The Italic words denote the corresponding Hebrew word. The word, according to Gesenius, means some one, a certain one; in Arabic, one who is distinct or definite, whom one points out as with the finger, and not by name. It is derived from an obsolete noun, &#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;  pa&#770;lo&#770;n, from the verb &#1508;&#1500;&#1492;  pa&#770;la&#770;h, to distinguish, and is united commonly with the word &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;  'alemon&#305;&#770;y - meaning, properly, one concealed or unknown. It is language, therefore, which would be properly addressed to an unknown person with whom we would desire to speak, or whom we would designate by the finger, or in some such way, without being able to call the name. Thus applied in the passage here, it means that Daniel did not know the names of the persons thus speaking, but simply saw that one was speaking to another. He had no other way of designating or distinguishing them than by applying a term which was commonly used of a stranger when one wished to address him, or to point him out, or to call him to him. There is no foundation in the word for the meaning suggested in the margin. Theodotion does not attempt to translate the word, but retains it - &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768;  phelmouni - Phelmouni. The Latin Vulgate well expresses the meaning, dixit unus sanctus alteri nescio loquenti. The full sense is undoubtedly conveyed by the two ideas,<p>(a) that the one referred to was unknown by name, and<p>(b) that he wished to designate him in some way, or to point him out.<p>How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice? - How long is what is designed to be represented by the vision to continue; that is, how long in fact will the offering of the daily sacrifice in the temple be suspended?<p>And the transgression of desolation - Margin, making desolate. That is, the act of iniquity on the part of Antiochus producing such desolation in the holy city and the temple - show long is that to continue?<p>To give both the sanctuary - The temple; the holy place where God dwelt by a visible symbol, and where he was worshipped.<p>And the host - The people of God - the Jewish people.<p>To be trodden under foot - To be utterly despised and prostrated - as anything which is trodden under our feet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. that certain saint&#8212;Daniel did not know the names of these two holy angels, but saw only that one was speaking to the other.<p>How long shall be the vision concerning &#8230; daily sacrifice&#8212;How long shall the daily sacrifice be suspended?<p>transgression of desolation&#8212;literally, "making desolate," that is, Antiochus desolating profanation of the temple (Da 11:31; 12:11).

The rendering of LXX. might suggest that ‘taken away’ had dropped out after ‘continual (burnt-offering)’; at any rate, whether actually read by the translators or not, this is a correct interpretation of the sense. ‘The transgression causing appalment’ is the heathen worship established by Antiochus in the Temple, with special reference, perhaps (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm" title="And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.">Daniel 11:31</a>, <a href="/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>), to the heathen altar erected by him on the altar of burnt-offering in the Temple court, which was naturally an object of extreme abhorrence to the pious Jews (see <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-47.htm" title="Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts:">1Ma 1:47</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-51.htm" title="In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, and appointed overseers over all the people, commanding the cities of Juda to sacrifice, city by city.">1Ma 1:51</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-54.htm" title="Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;">1Ma 1:54</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-59.htm" title="Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.">1Ma 1:59</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">causing appalment</span>] Except in Daniel, the word used means either <span class="ital">laid waste, desolated</span>[326] (<a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm" title="The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.">Lamentations 1:4</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-13.htm" title="From above has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate and faint all the day.">Lamentations 1:13</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-16.htm" title="For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.">Lamentations 1:16</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-11.htm" title="He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he has made me desolate.">Lamentations 3:11</a>), or <span class="ital">appalled</span>1 (<a href="/2_samuel/13-20.htm" title="And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing.

Fust's suggestion, held also by Behrmann, is that this is a contraction for <span class="accented">paloni almoni.</span> The renderings of the versions are worthy of note. The LXX., "And I heard one holy one speaking, and another holy one said to Phehnouni who spoke, How long shall the vision stand, and the removed sacrifice, and the sin of desolation given, and the holy place be desolate to be trodden underfoot (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">?"</span> Here the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall stand," is supposed by Professor Bevan to be an addition by one who did not fully comprehend the sentence. Following Gratz, Professor Bevan suggests a word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">mooram</span>), "removed," to explain the presence of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> - <span class="accented">a</span> suggestion that appears well-founded. His further suggestion, that <span class="accented">sim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>), "to set up," has been read instead of <span class="accented">shomaym</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>), must be due to inattention to the Greek. In it there is nothing about "set up," unless he transfers <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> from its place in the beginning of the sentence to the middle, and changes it to the active voice. Equally extraordinary is the suggestion that the translators read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>. The truth is, the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is probably due to a gloss or a confluence of readings. Theodotion is in close agreement with the Septuagint, save in the last clause, which he renders, "And the sanctuary and the power be trodden underfoot." The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic, "And I heard a holy one who spake, and a holy one said to <span class="accented">palmoni</span>, who spake, When shall the vision of the perpetuity (daily sacrifice?), and of sin and of corruption be completed, and the holy place and the host be trodden underfoot?" The translators must have read <span class="accented">shahata</span> instead of <span class="accented">shomaym.</span> "Completed," <span class="accented">nesh-tlem</span>, may have been added, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the Greek, but the fact that all the versions have a word not represented in the Massoretic would indicate the probability that something has dropped out. Some part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Greek Version, whereas some portion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Peshitta. Daniel hears one of those watching angels who desire to look into the evolution of the Divine purpose concerning man and his salvation, asking another, "How long shall be the desolation of Jerusalem under Epiphanes?" The irregular construction here suggests corruption. We would render the speech of the angel, "How long - the vision, the sacrifice - the sin of desolation to give the sanctuary and the service to be trodden underfoot?" as if Daniel had only heard snatches of what was said; we would, we may say, omit the "and" before "sanctuary." The Septuagint translators may have omitted <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), thinking only of its ordinary meaning, "host," forgetful of the fact that it is used of the temple service in <a href="/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>. These angels  are most interested in the length of time that the sanctuary shall remain desolate. This may indicate that it was evident, from the vision, that the period of desolation was a limited one. The scene presented to the imagination is striking. The seer, as he gazes on the vision appearing to him over the marsh at Susa, hears angelic voices that direct attention to what was most important to him and to his people. To the Israelites of the period of the Maccabees, the length of time that the temple service would be in abeyance was of the highest importance. It was well that they should know that the time was shortened for the elect's sake. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment pronounced on the accused, their punishment, and their miraculous deliverance.<p>After the decided refusal of the accused to worship his gods, Nebuchadnezzar changed his countenance toward them.
