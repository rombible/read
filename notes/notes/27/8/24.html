Eumenes, king of Pergamus, and his brother Attalus, being jealous of the Romans, desired to make the king of Syria their friend, and supported Antiochus in his kingdom. The divine displeasure also against the Jews operated to the furtherance of his designs, who was herein an agent of the vindictive justice of God.” <span class="ital">And he shall destroy wonderfully — </span>He shall cause a very great and scarcely credible desolation in Judea. Wintle renders it, <span class="ital">He shall make astonishing havoc, and shall be successful: </span>which prediction was accomplished when Jerusalem was taken by Antiochus, 40,000 Jews were slain, and as many were sold into slavery. <span class="ital">And shall destroy the mighty and the holy people — </span>Or, <span class="ital">the people of the holy God, </span>as <span class="greekheb">עם קדשׂים</span>may be rendered, the noun plural being sometimes applied to the Deity.

With regard to the former, Grotius observes, from Josephus, that men of the greatest reputation, and of the most generous spirit, among the Jews, paid no regard to Antiochus, and therefore were harassed daily, and died under the most bitter torments. Antiochus, in his first invasion of Judea, slew and led captive 80,000 Jews; and two years afterward sent Apollonius, with an army of 22,000 men, to destroy those that assembled in their synagogues on the sabbath, <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/5-14.htm" title="And there were destroyed within the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict; and no fewer sold than slain.">2Ma 5:14</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/5-24.htm" title="He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those that were in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:">2Ma 5:24</a>; and <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-29.htm" title="And after two years fully expired the king sent his chief collector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came unto Jerusalem with a great multitude,">1Ma 1:29</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:15-27 The eternal Son of God stood before the prophet in the appearance of a man, and directed the angel Gabriel to explain the vision. Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And his power shall be mighty - He shall be a powerful monarch.

These difficulties may be said to be present in all the versions of this passage. The LXX. renders, "And his power shall be confirmed, and not in his strength, and he shall destroy marvellously, and prosper and do, and shall destroy the rulers and people of the saints." Theodotion is so far slavishly close to the Massoretic text; but he seems to have read <span class="accented">qodesh</span>, an adjective agreeing with "<span class="accented">people</span>," instead of <span class="accented">qedosheem</span>, "<span class="accented">saints</span>;" and he omits the negative clause. The Peshitta is very close to the Massoretic. It emphasizes the negative clause by adding <span class="accented">denaphsho</span>, and translates "<span class="accented">wonders"</span> instead of "wonderfully." Jerome, more intent on expressing what is his own interpretation of the passage than on representing- the original, translates the first <span class="accented">heel</span> ("power") by <span class="accented">fortitude</span>, and the second by <span class="accented">viribus suis.</span> That the power of Epiphanes was great - greater than that of his brother and immediate predecessor - is undoubted. It is also the ease that he was confirmed in his place by the Romans, though, if we are to receive the account of Appian, the direct means of his elevation to the throne was the intervention of Eumenes of Pergamus on his behalf. Thus the reference of the phrase, "not by his own power," may be to this. Little as he might brook the thought, he was but a subject-ally of the great republic. The other interpretations are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Theodoret. Keil, Fuller, Havernick. Kranichfeld. and Moses Stuart, that the reference here is to Divine power as setting up Epiphanes to be a scourge to his people; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of von Lengerke, Kliefoth, Bevan, Behrmann, etc., not by might, but by his cunning; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that of Hitzig, which combines the two - his cunning is divinely given; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that of Calvin and Ewald, that the contrast is with the might of Alexander the Great. All of these have something to favour them, but also something against them. There is against the first that there is no reference in the context to the fact, true though it was, that Antiochus was raised up by God for his own purposes. Against the second is the pronominal suffix, which would be needless if the contrast were between force and fraud. Of course, Hitzig's combination falls with this. Against the view advocated by Calvin and Ewald is the fact that it seems a long time to hold the reference to Alexander in abeyance. Still, it may be urged that the vision was before the prophet; on the other hand, the relative strength of Epiphanes and Alexander does not seem to be of importance. We still think that the real reference is to the fact that he did not attain the throne either by inheritance or by his own prowess, but by the help and authority of others, namely, Eumencs and Rome. <span class="accented">And he shall destroy wonderfully.</span> Gratz thinks <span class="accented">yasheeth</span>, "destroy," suspicious, and Professor Bevan suggests <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;</span>, (<span class="accented">yaseeh</span>), and would render, "He shall utter monstrous things;" but, unfortunately for his view, there is no hint in the versions of any difficulty as to the reading, and, further, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">sooh</span>) does not mean "<span class="accented">utter</span>," but "meditate." We must take the words as they stand (comp. <a href="/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19</a>), and translate, "He shall destroy portentously." Certainly Epiphanes was to the Jews a portent of destruction; there had not been his like - not Nebuchadnezzar, who burned the temple, was to be compared to him who endeavoured to blot out the worship of Jehovah altogether: not any other of the Greek monarchs. He was unique in his enmity against God and his worship. <span class="accented">He</span>  <span class="accented">shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</span> The rendering of the Revised Version better conveys the sense of the original, "He shall destroy the mighty ones." There has been discussion as to the distinction involved here. Ewald regards the mighty as the three other horns of the ten (<a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>) - an interpretation which proceeds in the false identification of the fourth beast with the Greek Empire. Rashi imagines the star-worshippers; this seems the height of caprice. Jephet-ibn-Ali, who identifies the little horn with Mahommed, holds the "mighty" to be the Romans. Keil and Fuller hold it to be the heathen rulers generally. Von Lengerke, Kliefoth, and others maintain it refers to the rich of the holy people, while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">am</span>) are the poor. Hitzig refers it to the three claimants for the crown, whom Antiochus is alleged, on somewhat insufficient evidence, to have overthrown; Behrmann and Zockler, to the political and warlike enemies of Epiphanes, in contrast to the holy people, who were unwarlike. Kranichfeld refers it to the rulers of Israel, as distinct from the people; Calvin to "neighbouring nations." Moses Stuart would render, "great numbers, even the people of the saints;" while Professor Bevan thinks there is an interpolation here, and adopts a reading of Gratz from the LXX. for the beginning of the following verse. On the whole, this seems the best solution of the difficulty. After Epiphanes had destroyed the "mighty," that is to say, the political enemies he had, the Egyptians, etc., he directed his mind the "people of the saints." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Regarding the collocation of the words &#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;, see under <a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>; and regarding the Nymid@fha and the threatened punishment, see under <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; we regard, with the lxx, Theodot., Vulg., and old interpreters, as a fem. adverbial: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, ita, as it occurs in <a href="/daniel/2-10.htm">Daniel 2:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/5-7.htm">Ezra 5:7</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>.
