They teach her that God has foreseen her affliction, that it comes from Him in His love, and that it shall last only for a short while. This promise accounts for the firmness which was exhibited by the saints of the Maccabees, which entitles their faith to a place in the same list of faithful men which contains the names of Abel, Abraham, and Moses (<a href="/context/hebrews/11-34.htm" title="Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.">Hebrews 11:34-38</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Shut thou up.</span>—The revelation is to be kept safe, because the time of fulfilment is far off, and then the comforting words will be needed.

The angel here tells him, that these calamities would certainly last during the time expressed by that number of days, and then would have an end. <span class="ital">Wherefore shut thou up the vision, for it shall be for many days — </span>Some consider these words as expressing the same thing that is meant by <span class="ital">shutting up the words, </span>and <span class="ital">sealing the book, </span><a href="/daniel/12-4.htm" title="But you, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.">Daniel 12:4</a>. The sense in both places, they think, is, that the full meaning of the prophecy should be concealed from people in general, till the accomplishment of the events foretold. Thus we find that <span class="ital">shutting </span>and <span class="ital">opening, sealing </span>and <span class="ital">unfolding, </span>are opposed in the prophetical language, and import the same as concealing and revealing. Thus taken the words imply, that prophecies are never fully understood till they are accomplished: and the nearer the time approaches of their accomplishment, the more light shall diligent inquirers have for the explaining them. But the words may also imply a command to Daniel to commit this vision to writing, and then to take such care of the copy as would ensure its preservation, even till the things spoken of in it should be fulfilled; that so the prophecies might be compared with the events accomplishing them, and it might be seen how exactly they had been foretold. And in order that Daniel might take proper measures for preserving the account of these visions, and that posterity might take the same care, the angel concludes with observing, that the vision should be for <span class="ital">many days; </span>that is, that the accomplishment of it would not take place till after a long space of time; it being a term of near four hundred years from the first intimation of the vision, in the third of Belshazzar, to the cleansing of the sanctuary by Judas, in the time of Antiochus. It is of importance to observe here, that in remembrance of this great mercy which God had showed to his people, in delivering them from the tyranny and idolatry of Antiochus, a solemn feast was instituted, called <span class="greekheb">Εγκαινια</span>, or the feast of dedication, which was annually observed, in consequence of cleansing the sanctuary, and the consecration of the altar, by Judas Maccabeus, for the space of eight days, from the 25th day of the month Casleu, <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-59.htm" title="Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth and gladness.">1Ma 4:59</a>. And to this St. John alludes, <a href="/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>, where he speaks of <span class="ital">the feast of dedication.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:15-27 The eternal Son of God stood before the prophet in the appearance of a man, and directed the angel Gabriel to explain the vision. Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the vision of the evening and the morning - That is, of the two thousand three hundred days.

The rendering of the LXX. here is, "The vision of the evening and morning was found true, and the vision has been secured for many days." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">asher ne'emar</span>) has been read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, although it is difficult to see the genesis of such a reading from the Massoretic , or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> The LXX. rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> ought to be observed - not "shut up," in the sense of being "sealed," but "defended from interference by being secured as with a hedge." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text, but have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>, construct of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="accented">The vision of the evening and the morning</span> refers to ver. 14. The phrase used. here differs by the insertion of the definite article: but this merely intimates a reference. This statement does not mean that the period indicated by the two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings would end with the death of Antiochus. Certainly, his death occurred in the year following the cleansing of the temple (1 Macc. 6:16). If the writer reckons the beginning of the year according to the Macedonian Calendar, almost a year must have elapsed between the temple-cleansing and the death of Antiochus; but it is the cleansing that is the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span>, not the death of Antiochus. The pollution of the temple was the event that, of all others, would be trying to the faith and patience of Jewish believers; therefore attention is directed to this. As the beginning of this season of trial is the point to which the whole history of the Greek Empire travels, so the termination of this desecration is the end contemplated. <span class="accented">Shut thou up the vision.</span> Certainly the verb <span class="accented">satham</span> means sometimes "to hide;" and it is also certain that it is a characteristic of apocalyptic literature to contain, in the text, elaborate directions fur hiding the vision; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Apocalypse of Moses. It has been argued that this is a preparation for the publication of Daniel in the age of the Maccabees, so long after the date at which it purports to be written. But there is no description of how the book is to be hidden, as in the <span class="accented">Assumption</span> of Moses. Moreover, the translators of the LXX. did not understand <span class="accented">satham as</span> "hide." If it had been hidden, and had been discovered, he would have known and translated accordingly. Then when we turn to the next verse, we find that Daniel himself did not understand the command as meaning that he was to keep the vision secret from his contemporaries; so far from that being the case, one at' his reasons for distress is that no one understood the vision. <span class="accented">The vision shall be far many days.</span> That is to say, that a long interval divided the time when the revelation was made from the time of its fulfilment (<a href="/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>); the vision he sees is for many days to come. Before the beginning of the history revealed to Daniel, certainly not many years intervened; but between the days of Belshazzar and those of Antiochus was an interval of approximately four centuries. The Persian Empire rose and fell, and the Macedonian Empire rose and was approaching its fall. At the end of the period, the light of the vision fell most clearly. It was not necessary that Daniel should know the events portrayed to foretell them truly, any more than it was needful that the Second Isaiah should know the exact historical events portrayed so clearly in his fifty-third chapter. Daniel  could not fail to know of Persia, and it even did not require more than a knowledge of the past, and ordinary powers of political forecast, to see that Cyrus might, and probably would, found a world-empire. He knew of the Greeks: there were Greeks in the army of Nebuchadnezzar. Moreover, we learn from Herodotus (1:77) that Nabu-nahid Labynetus had made an alliance with Croesus, in order to check the advance of Cyrus. We know from Herodotus (1:26, 27) that Croesus subdued all the Greek cities in <span class="accented">Asia</span> Minor. To Daniel, who possibly had favoured this alliance with the Western monarch, the King of Javan would mean, not Alexander the Great, as it means to us, but Croesus. But his hopes that Babylon will be delivered by the help of Croesus are shown to be groundless, by the intimation that it will be "for many days." The intimation that he had made to Belshazzar, of the interpretation of the inscription on the palace wall, did not necessarily, in his mind, militate against the hope that repentance might lead to respite. Daniel may have made use of political expedients to help in the result he wished. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-31.htm">Daniel 3:31-33</a>)<p>These verses form the introduction<p>(Note: The connection of these verses with the third chapter in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin Bibles is altogether improper. The originator of the division into chapters appears to have entertained the idea that Nebuchadnezzar had made known the miracle of the deliverance of the three men from the fiery furnace to his subjects by means of a proclamation, according to which the fourth chapter would contain a new royal proclamation different from that former one, - an idea which was rejected by Luther, who has accordingly properly divided the chapters. Conformably to that division, as Chr. B. Michaelis has well remarked, "prius illud programma in fine capitis tertii excerptum caput sine corpore, posterius vero quod capite IV exhibetur, corpus sine capite, illic enim conspicitur quidem exordium, sed sine narratione, hic vero narratio quidem, sed sine exordio."

The doxology of the second part of <a href="/daniel/4-33.htm">Daniel 4:33</a> occurs again with little variation in <a href="/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31</a> (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>), <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18</a>, and is met with also in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>, which bears the name of David; while the rendering of &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512; , from generation to generation, i.e., as long as generations exist, agrees with <a href="/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>. </body></html>
