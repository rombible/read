Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now that being broken - By the death of Alexander.<p>Whereas four stood up for it - Stood up in its place.<p>Four kingdoms shall stand up - Ultimately.

In this variation we find also Theodotion and the Peshitta agreeing. Jerome has "<span class="accented">ejus."</span> It is difficult to decide what is the true reading here. In the reading of the older versions the meaning is that these kings which should succeed Alexander should not be mighty. The reading of the Massoretic and Jerome implies a direct and natural comparison with Alexander the Great. As for the Greek versions, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is easily mistaken for <span class="greek">&#x3c9;</span> in uncial manuscripts. As for the Syriac,  is apt to be added to of the third person, and produce the difference we find. While the Greek versions and Jerome render, "his nation" instead of "the nation," as in the Massoretic, the Peshitta follows the Massoretic , which is wrong here. The point of the contrast is that the kings that succeeded Alexander were not of his family. Certainly none of the <span class="accented">successors</span> of Alexander had an empire nearly so extensive as his. The only one that really even comes into comparison with the empire of Alexander is that of Seleucus Nicator. But not only had he neither European nor African dominions, he did not possess, save for a little while. Asia Minor, nor Palestine, nor India beyond the Indus at all. The Parthian Empire seen sprang up, and wrested from the Solenoid a large portion of their possessions east of the Euphrates. It can well be said, even of the empire of Seleucus, that it had not the power of that of Alexander the Great. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The impression made by this event on Nebuchadnezzar.<p>The marvellous deliverance of the three from the flames of the furnace produced such an impression on Nebuchadnezzar, that he changed his earlier and humbler judgment (<a href="/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a>) regarding the God of the Jews, and spoke now in praise of the might of this God. For at the same time he not only openly announced that He had saved (<a href="/daniel/3-28.htm">Daniel 3:28</a>) His servants, but also by an edict, issued to all the peoples of his kingdom, he forbade on pain of death the doing of any dishonour to the God of the Jews (<a href="/daniel/3-29.htm">Daniel 3:29</a>). Nebuchadnezzar, however, did not turn to the true God. He neither acknowledged Jehovah as the only, or the alone true God, nor did he command Him to be worshipped. He only declared Him to be a God who is able to save His servants as no other could, and merely forbade the despising and reviling of this God. Whoever speaks &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, that which is erroneous or unjust, against the God of Shadrach, etc., shall be put to death. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, to err, to commit a fault, is changed in the Keri into &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, which occurs in <a href="/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/4-22.htm">Ezra 4:22</a>, and in the Targg.; but without sufficient ground, since with other words both forms are found together, e.g., &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, vidua, with &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, viduitas. According to this, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in abstr. means the error; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492; in concr., the erroneous. Hitz. finds the command partly too narrow, partly quite unsuitable, because an error, a simple oversight, should find pardon as soon as possible. But the distinction between a fault arising from mistake and one arising from a bad intention does not accord with the edict of an Oriental despot, which must be in decided terms, so that there may be no room in cases of transgression for an appeal to a mere oversight. Still less importance is to be attached to the objection that the carrying out of the command may have had its difficulties. but by such difficulties the historical character of the narrative is not brought under suspicion. As the Chaldeans in this case had watched the Jews and accused them of disobedience, so also could the Jews scattered throughout the kingdom bring before the tribunal the heathen who blasphemed their God.</body></html>
