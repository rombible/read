Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host - Grotius, Ephraem the Syrian, and others, understand this of Onias the high priest, as the chief officer of the holy people. Lengerke supposes that it means God himself. This interpretation is the more probable; and the idea in the phrase "prince of the host" is, that as God is the ruler of the host of heaven - leading on the constellations, and marshalling the stars, so he may be regarded as the ruler of the holy army here below - the ministers of religion, and his people. Against him as the Ruler and Leader of his people Antiochus exalted himself, particularly by attempting to change his laws, and to cause his worship to cease.<p>And by him - Margin, "from him." The meaning is, that the command or authority to do this proceeded from him.<p>The daily sacrifice was taken away - The sacrifice that was offered daily in the temple, morning and evening, was suspended. A full account of this may be found in 1 Macc. 1:20-24, 29-32, 44-50. In the execution of the purposes of Antiochus, he "entered the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick, and all the vessels thereof; and the table of showbread, the pouring vessels, etc., and stripped the temple of all the ornaments of gold." After two years he again visited the city, and "smote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel, and when he had taken the spoils of the city he set it on fire, and pulled down the walls thereof on every side." Everything in Jerusalem was made desolate. Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach, her honor into contempt." Subsequently, by a solemn edict, and by more decisive acts, he put a period to the worship of God in the temple, and polluted and defiled every part of it. "For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, that they should follow the strange laws of the land, and forbid burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and drink-offerings in the temple; and that they should profane the sabbaths and festival days, and pollute the sanctuary and holy people; set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts; that they should also leave their children uncir. cumcised, and make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation; to the end they might forget the laws, and change all the ordinances," 1 Macc. 1:44-49.<p>It was undoubtedly to these acts of Antiochus that the passage before us refers, and the event accords with the words of the prediction as clearly as if what is a prediction had been written afterward, and had been designed to represent what actually occurred as a matter of historical record. The word which is rendered "daily sacrifice" - the word "sacrifice" being supplied by the translators - &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;  ta&#770;m&#305;&#770;yd - means, properly, continuance, prepetuity, and then what is continuous or constant - as a sacrifice or service daily occurring. The word sacrifice is properly inserted here. - Gesenius, Lexicon The meaning of the word rendered "was taken away" - &#1492;&#1512;&#1501;  huram (Hophal from &#1512;&#1493;&#1501;  ru&#770;m - to exalt, to lift up) - here is, that it was lifted up, and then was taken away; that is, it was made to cease - as if it had been carried away. - Gesenius.<p>And the place of his sanctuary - Of the sanctuary or holy place of the, "Prince of the host," that is, of God. The reference is to the temple.<p>Was cast down - The temple was not entirely destroyed by Antiochus, but it was robbed and rifled, and its holy vessels were carried away. The walls indeed remained, but it was desolate, and the whole service then was abandoned.

So Da 8:25, "he shall stand up against the Prince of princes"; "against the God of gods" (Da 11:36; compare Da 7:8).

So that a fuller accomplishment is future. Antiochus took away the daily sacrifice for a few years; the Romans, for many ages, and "cast down" the temple; and Antichrist, in connection with Rome, the fourth kingdom, shall do so again after the Jews in their own land, still unbelieving, shall have rebuilt the temple, and restored the Mosaic ritual: God giving them up to him "by reason of transgression" (Da 8:12), that is, not owning the worship so rendered [Tregelles]; and then the opposition of the horn to the "truth" is especially mentioned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Even to the prince of the host; </span> not only against the high priest Onias, whom he put from his priesthood, and sold the high priesthood, <span class="bld">/APC 2Mac 4</span>, but against God himself, which showed his daring insolence, and God’s patience and permission, for the sins of his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By him the daily sacrifice was taken away; </span> for he so persecuted the people of God, that he forced them to omit the worship of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The place of his sanctuary was cast down; </span> he took away the use of the temple as to the holy service and sacrifices, commanding that it should not be called the temple of God, but of Jupiter Olympus, whose image he set up in it, and gave the priesthood to wicked men, as Jason and Menelaus. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince host,....

There is a difference here between the Q'ri and the K'thib. The latter reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, while the former reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span>, the hophal of the same verb At first sight the difficulty is not lessened by consideration of the versions. The Septuagint as it at present stands is utterly unintelligible, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and by him everlasting mountains were broken down, and their place and sacrifice taken away, and he placed it in the very ground, and he prospered [reading with Syriac] and was, and the holy place shall be laid waste." This confusion is due to confluence of readings, and is not difficult to disentangle with the help of the Massoretic text. Up to the last two words the Septuagint is a translation of a text differing from the Massoretic simply by intelligible variations and repetitions not uncommon in the Septuagint. The first clause of the LXX. originally was probably, "Till the prince shall deliver the captivity," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">shebee</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (tzaba) - a scribe, finding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span> in his Hebrew, then added the translation of it to the margin of his Greek copy, from which it got into the text. The original of the LXX. had also <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">yatztzeel</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">hig'deel</span>) - a confusion easily made in the elder script, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> were like. We learn from the Talmud (<span class="accented">Shabb.</span>, 103b) that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span> was liable to be mistaken by scribes for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span>. Moreover, "captivity" would naturally suggest <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5dc;</span>, "<span class="accented">to deliver."</span> The second clause is, "By him the everlasting mountains were broken down." Here <span class="accented">hayreem</span> has been read with the K'thib, and vocalized as if it were <span class="accented">hareem</span>, and <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "continual," translated as equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> ('<span class="accented">olam</span>), "everlasting." The next clause reveals the other meaning of <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "sacrifice," which probably had been written on the margin, and then dropped into the text. The latter part of the Septuagint verse appears to be confused with the latter part of the following verse according to the Massoretes. Theodotion is even less intelligible than the Septuagint, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and through him the sacrifice was broken down, and he prospered, and the holy place shall be made desolate." It is to be noticed that the first clause here agrees with the LXX. It is possible that "and he prospered" is a doublet, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> being read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> in some copy. The Peshitta differs from beth the Greek versions, "Until it arrive to the chiefs of the host, and by it was set up in perpetuity, and preparing he strengthened the sanctuary," and while it is difficult to understand the origin of the variation in the first clause, it is clear that in the second clause the translator must have read <span class="accented">hish-leem</span> for <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> The one thing that seems clear is that the reading of the K'thib is to be preferred. We should read <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, not <span class="accented">hooram.</span> Only the first of these could be read "mountains." If we translate the words as they stand, we shall certainly be removed out of the region of all the commentators. It is assumed that "the little horn" is the subject of this sentence; but "horn" is feminine in Hebrew, and the verbs here are in the masculine; this is against it being the nominative. The "prince of the host," then, must be the nominative of the verbs and subject of the sentence. The rendering of the first clause ought to be, then, "Until the prince of the host magnify himself (<a href="/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>), and by himself he shall offer the daily sacrifice. And he shall cast down the foundation of his holy place," reading <span class="accented">hishlayk instead</span> of <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> We should feel strongly in. clined to transfer the first "and" to <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, and, changing the punctuation, read, "Until the prince of the host shall make himself greater than he" - viz, the tyrant represented by "the little horn" - "and shall offer the daily sacrifice." If we might read <span class="accented">hishleem</span> with the Peshitta instead of <span class="accented">hoosh-lak</span>, we get a satisfactory meaning to the last clause, in which case we should render, "He shall complete the place of his sanctuary." We would understand by "complete," "to perfectly purify." Taking the Massoretic text thus with little modification, we have a description of the successes of Judas Maccabseus, who was prince of the host, and as such became stronger than Epiphanes, and then cleansed the temple, and offered the continual daily sacrifice. We give, as a curiosity, the note of Saadiah Gaon: "The King of Ishmael was more powerful than the kings of Rome who had  Jerusalem, and he took Jerusalem from them by force." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1500; denotes the ethical ability, i.e., the ability limited by the divine holiness and righteousness, not the omnipotence of God as such. For this the accused did not doubt, nor will they place in question the divine omnipotence before the heathen king. The conclusion begins after the Athnach, and &#1492;&#1503; means, not see! lo! (according to the old versions and many interpreters), for which Daniel constantly uses &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;, but it means if, as here the contrast &#1500;&#1488; &#1493;&#1492;&#1503;, and if not (<a href="/daniel/3-18.htm">Daniel 3:18</a>), demands. There lies in the answer, "If our God will save us, then ... and if not, know, O king, that we will not serve thy gods," neither audacity, nor a superstitious expectation of some miracle (<a href="/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17</a>), nor fanaticism (<a href="/daniel/3-18.htm">Daniel 3:18</a>), as Berth., v. Leng., and Hitz. maintain, but only the confidence of faith and a humble submission to the will of God. "The three simply see that their standpoint and that of the king are altogether different, also that their standpoint can never be clearly understood by Nebuchadnezzar, and therefore they give up any attempt to justify themselves. But that which was demanded of them they could not do, because it would have been altogether contrary to their faith and their conscience. And then without fanaticism they calmly decline to answer, and only say, 'Let him do according to his own will;' thus without superstitiousness committing their deliverance to God" (Klief.). </body></html>
