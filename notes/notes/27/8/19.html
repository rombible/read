Daniel's fainting and astonishment at the prospect of evils he saw coming on his people and the church, confirm the opinion that long-continued calamities were foretold. The vision being ended, a charge was given to Daniel to keep it private for the present. He kept it to himself, and went on to do the duty of his place. As long as we live in this world we must have something to do in it; and even those whom God has most honoured, must not think themselves above their business. Nor must the pleasure of communion with God take us from the duties of our callings, but we must in them abide with God. All who are intrusted with public business must discharge their trust uprightly; and, amidst all doubts and discouragements, they may, if true believers, look forward to a happy issue. Thus should we endeavour to compose our minds for attending to the duties to which each is appointed, in the church and in the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation - In the future time when the Divine indignation shall be manifest toward the Hebrew people; to wit, by suffering the evils to come upon them which Antiochus would inflict.

Cf. <a href="/daniel/11-36.htm" title="And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.">Daniel 11:36</a>, ‘and he (Antiochus) shall prosper till the <span class="ital">indignation</span> be accomplished;’ and <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-64.htm" title="And there was very great wrath upon Israel.">1Ma 1:64</a>, ‘and there came exceeding great wrath upon Israel.’ The word may be suggested by <a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm" title="For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.">Isaiah 10:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm" title="Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over.">Isaiah 26:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for</span> <span class="bld">it</span> (i.e. the vision, <span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a></span>) <span class="bld">belongeth to the appointed-time of</span> <span class="ital">the end</span>] The sentence seems suggested by <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm" title="For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.">Habakkuk 2:3</a> (quoted on <span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17</a></span>), though the word ‘end’ has not there the special sense which it has acquired in Daniel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</span> The Septuagint here inserts a clause after "indignation." It reads, "on the children of thy people." It may have been inserted from <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, only it is used in such a different sense that that does not seem very likely.

On the other hand, its omission from Theodotion and the Peshitta is not so easily intelligible. Theodotion is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is more brief, practically omitting the last clause. We have here the reference to the end, as in ver. 17 it is not the end of the world that is in the mind of the writer, but the "end of the indignation." The Jews, while maintaining their gallant struggle against Epiphanes, have need of being assured that the battle will have an end, and one determined before by God, The angel has to make Daniel know the end of the indignation. It may be said  that the present time, when Israel has neither country nor city, is one of indignation; but the immediate reference is to the persecution against the Jews inaugurated by Epiphanes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The king, who sat watching the issue of the matter, looked through the door into the furnace, and observed that the three who had been cast into it bound, walked about freed from their bonds and unhurt; and, in truth, he saw not the three only, but also a fourth, "like to a son of the gods," beside them. At this sight he was astonished and terrified. He hastily stood up; and having assured himself by a consultation with his counsellors that three men had indeed been cast bound into the furnace, while he saw four walking in the midst of it, he approached the mouth of the furnace and cried to the three to come forth. They immediately came out, and were inspected by the assembled officers of state, and found to be wholly uninjured as to their bodies, their clothes being unharmed also, and without even the smell of fire upon them. &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; refers, without doubt, to the officers of the kingdom, ministers or counselors of state standing very near the king, since they are named in <a href="/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a> and <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a> (<a href="/daniel/6-7.htm">Daniel 6:7</a>) along with the first three ranks of officers, and (<a href="/daniel/4-23.htm">Daniel 4:23</a> [26]) during Nebuchadnezzar's madness they conducted the affairs of government. The literal meaning of the word, however, is not quite obvious. Its derivation from the Chald. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503;, duces, with the Hebr. article (Gesen.), which can only be supported by &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;, <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> (Targ.), is decidedly opposed by the absence of all analogies of the blending into one word of the article with a noun in the Semitic language. The Alkoran offers no corresponding analogues, since this word with the article is found only in the more modern dialects. But the meaning which P. v. Bohlen (Symbolae ad interp. s. Codicis ex ling. pers. p. 26) has sought from the Persian word which is translated by simul judex, i.e., socius in judicio, is opposed not only by the fact that the compensation of the Mim by the Dagesch, but also the composition and the meaning, has very little probability.<p>The fourth whom Nebuchadnezzar saw in the furnace was like in his appearance, i.e., as commanding veneration, to a son of the gods, i.e., to one of the race of the gods. In <a href="/daniel/3-28.htm">Daniel 3:28</a> the same personage is called an angel of God, Nebuchadnezzar there following the religious conceptions of the Jews, in consequence of the conversation which no doubt he had with the three who were saved. Here, on the other hand, he speaks in the spirit and meaning of the Babylonian doctrine of the gods, according to the theogonic representation of the &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; of the gods peculiar to all Oriental religions, whose existence among the Babylonians the female divinity Mylitta associated with Bel places beyond a doubt; cf. Hgst. Beitr. i. p. 159, and Hv., Kran., and Klief. in loc.<p>Acting on this assumption, which did not call in question the deliverance of the accused by the miraculous interposition of the Deity, Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace and cried to the three men to come out, addressing them as the servants (worshippers) of the most high God. This address does not go beyond the circle of heathen ideas. He does not call the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego the only true God, but only the most high God, the chief of the gods, just as the Greeks called their Zeus &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;.

The forms &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1488;, are peculiar to Daniel (v. 27f., <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-21.htm">Daniel 5:21</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-11.htm">Daniel 7:11</a>).
