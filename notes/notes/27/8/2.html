Could we foresee the changes that shall be when we are gone, we should be less affected with changes in our own day. The ram with two horns was the second empire, that of Media and Persia. He saw this ram overcome by a he-goat. This was Alexander the Great. Alexander, when about thirty-three years of age, and in his full strength, died, and showed the vanity of worldly pomp and power, and that they cannot make a man happy. While men dispute, as in the case of Alexander, respecting the death of some prosperous warrior, it is plain that the great First Cause of all had no more of his plan for him to execute, and therefore cut him off. Instead of that one great horn, there came up four notable ones, Alexander's four chief captains. A little horn became a great persecutor of the church and people of God. It seems that the Mohammedan delusion is here pointed out. It prospered, and at one time nearly destroyed the holy religion God's right hand had planted. It is just with God to deprive those of the privileges of his house who despise and profane them; and to make those know the worth of ordinances by the want of them, who would not know it by the enjoyment of them. Daniel heard the time of this calamity limited and determined; but not the time when it should come. If we would know the mind of God, we must apply to Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not hid from us, but hid for us. There is much difficulty as to the precise time here stated, but the end of it cannot be very distant. God will, for his own glory, see to the cleansing of the church in due time. Christ died to cleanse his church; and he will so cleanse it as to present it blameless to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I saw in a vision - I looked as the vision appeared to me; or I saw certain things represented to me in a vision. On the word vision, see the notes at <a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>. The meaning here would seem to be that a vision appeared to Daniel, and that he contemplated it with earnestness, to understand what it meant.<p>That I was at Shushan - As remarked in the introduction to this chapter, this might mean that he seemed to be there, or that the vision was represented to him as being there; but the most natural construction is to suppose that Daniel was actually there himself. Why he was there he has not informed us directly - whether he was on public business, or on his own. From <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>, however - "Afterward I rose up, and did the king's business" - it would seem most probable that he was then in the service of the king. This supposition will not conflict with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/5-10.htm">Daniel 5:10-11</a>, in which the queen-mother, when the handwriting appeared on the wall of the palace informs Belshazzar that there was "a man in his kingdom in whom was the spirit of the holy gods, etc." - from which it might be objected that Daniel was at that time unknown to the king, and could not have been in his employ, for it might have been a fact that he was in the employ of the king as an officer of the government, and yet it may have been forgotten that he had this power of disclosing the meaning of visions.<p>He may have been employed in the public service, but his services to the father of the king, and his extraordinary skill in interpreting dreams and visions may not at once have occurred to the affrighted monarch and his courtiers. Shushan, or Susa, the chief town of Susiana, was the capital of Persia after the time of Cyrus, in which the kings of Persia had their principal residence, <a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/1-2.htm">Esther 1:2-5</a>. It was situated on the Eulaeus or Choaspes, probably on the spot now occupied by the village Shus. - Rennel, Geog. of Herodotus; Kinneir, Mem. Pers. Emp.; K. Porter's Travels, ii. 4, 11; Ritter, Erdkunde, Asien, 9: 294; Pict. Bib. in loc. At Shus there are extensive ruins, stretching perhaps twelve miles from one extremity to the other, and consisting, like the other ruins in that country, of hillocks of earth, and rubbish, covered with broken, pieces of brick and colored tile. At the foot of these mounds is the so-called tomb of Daniel, a small building erected on the spot where the remains of Daniel are believed in that region to rest.<p>It is apparently modern, but nothing but the belief that this was the site of the prophet's sepulchre could have led to its being built in the place where it stands - Malcolm, Hist. of Persia, i. 255, 256. The city of Shus is now a gloomy wilderness, inhabited by lions, hyenas, and other beasts of prey. - Kitto's Cyclo., art. "Shushan." Sir John Kinneir says that the dread of these animals compelled Mr. Monteith and himself to take shelter for the night within the walls that encompass Daniel's tomb. Of that tomb Sir John Malcolm says, "It is a small building, but sufficient to shelter some dervishes who watch the remains of the prophet, and are supported by the alms of pious pilgrims, who visit the holy sepulchre. The dervishes are now the only inhabitants of Susa; and every species of wild beast roams at large over the spot on which some of the proudest palaces ever raised by human art once stood." - Vol. i. pp. 255, 256. For a description of the ruins of Susa, see Pict. Bib. in loc. This city was about 450 Roman miles from Seleucia, and was built, according to Pliny, 6; 27, in a square of about 120 stadia. It was the summer residence of the Persian kings (Cyrop. 8, 6, 10), as they passed the spring in Ecbatana, and the autumn and winter in Babylon. See Lengerke, in loc. It was in this city that Alexander the Great married Stateira, daughter of Darius Codomanus. The name means a lily, and was probably given to it on account of its beauty - Lengerke. Rosenmuller supposes that the vision here is represented to have appeared to Daniel in this city because it would be the future capital of Persia, and because so much of the vision pertained to Persia. See Maurer, in loc.<p>In the palace - This word (&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;  b&#305;&#770;yra&#770;h) means a fortress, a castle, a fortified palace. - Gesenius. See <a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/esther/1-5.htm">Esther 1:5</a>; <a href="/esther/2-5.htm">Esther 2:5</a>; <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/9-6.htm">Esther 9:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/esther/9-11.htm">Esther 9:11-12</a>. It would seem to have been given to the city because it was a fortified place. The word applied not only to the palace proper, a royal residence, but to the whole adjacent city. It is not necessary to suppose that Daniel was in the palace proper, but only that he was in the city to which the name was given.<p>Which is in the province of Elam - See the notes at <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>. This province was bounded on the east by Persia Proper, on the west by Babylonia, on the north by Media, and on the south by the Persian Gulf. It was about half as large as Persia, and not quite as large as England. - Kitto's Cyclo. It was probably conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, and in the time of Belshazzar was subject to the Babylonian dominion, Shushan had been doubtless the capital of the kingdom of Elam while it continued a separate kingdom, and remained the capital of the province while it was under the Babylonian yoke, and until it was subdued as a part of the empire by Cyrus. It was then made one of the capitals of the united Medo-Persian empire. It was when it was the capital of a province that it was visited by Daniel, and that he saw the vision there. Possibly he may have dwelt there subsequently, and died there.<p>And I was by the river of Ulai - This river flowed by the city of Shushan, or Susa, and fell into the united stream of the Tigris and the Euphrates. It is called by Pliny (Nat. Hist. vi. 81) Eulaeus; but it is described by Greek writers generally under the name of Choaspes. - Herod. v. 49; Strabo, xv. p. 728. It is now known by the name Kerah, called by the Turks Karasu. It passes on the west of the ruins of Shus (Susa), and enters the Shat-ul-Arab about twenty miles below Korna. - Kinneir, Geog. Mem. of the Persian Empire, pp. 96, 97. See Kitto's Cyclo., art. "Ulai" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Shushan&#8212;Susa. Though then comparatively insignificant, it was destined to be the capital of Persia after Cyrus' time. Therefore Daniel is transported into it, as being the capital of the kingdom signified by the two-horned ram (Ne 1:1; Es 1:2-5).<p>Elam&#8212;west of Persia proper, east of Babylonia, south of Media. Daniel was not present there personally, but in vision.<p>Ulai&#8212;called in Pliny Eulœus; by the Greeks, Choaspes. Now Kerah, or Karasu. So in Da 10:4 he receives a vision near another river, the Hiddekel. So Ezekiel (Eze 1:1) at the Chebar. Perhaps because synagogues used to be built near rivers, as before praying they washed their hands in the water [Rosenmuller], (Ps 137:1).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I was at Shushan; </span> in his mind and thoughts, not bodily, and was by the river Ulai: some think he was locally there, being sent thither in embassy by Cyrus; but Daniel was now at Babylon, when it was besieged and taken, <span class="bld">Da 5</span>; he was only there in spirit, as the prophet Ezekiel saith he was in Jerusalem, <span class="bld"><a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a></span>. Now Daniel had this vision at Shushan, because their deliverance was to come by Cyrus the Persian or Elamite, for Elam is Persia.

The following things: <p>and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; not in reality, but so it seemed to him in the vision; as Ezekiel, when in Babylon, seemed in the visions of God to be at Jerusalem, <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>. This city Shushan, or Susa, as it is called by other writers, and signifies a "lily", was so called from the plenty of lilies that grew about it, or because of the pleasantness of it; it was the metropolis of the country Susiana, which had its name from it, and was afterwards the royal seat of the kings of Persia. This was first made so by Cyrus; for Strabo (a) says, that he and the Persians having overcome the Medes, observing that their own country was situated in the extreme parts, and Susa more inward, and nearer to other nations, being, as he says, between Persia and Babylon, set his royal palace in it; approving both the nearness of the country, and the dignity of the city. Here the kings of Persia laid up their treasures, even prodigious large ones; hence Aristagoras told Cleomenes, that if he could take that city, he would vie, and might contend, with Jupiter for riches (b); for hither Cyrus carried whatever money he had in Persia, even forty thousand talents, some say fifty (c). Alexander (d), when he took this city, found a vast quantity of riches in it. It is called here a palace; and so it is spoken of by Herodotus (e), Diodorus Siculus (f), Pausanius (g), Pliny (h), and others, as a royal city, where were the residence and palace of the kings of Persia; but the royal palace was not in it at this time; the kings of Babylon had their palace and kept their court at Babylon, where Daniel was; but in vision it seemed to him that he was in Shushan, and which was represented to him as a palace, as it would be, and as the metropolis of the kingdom of Persia, which he had a view of in its future flourishing condition, and as destroyed by Alexander; for, as before observed, it was Cyrus that first made it a royal city; whereas this vision was in the third year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon. Some versions render it, a "tower" or "castle"; and so several writers, as Strabo (i) Plutarch (k) and Pliny (l), speak of the tower or castle in it. Diodorus Siculus (m) says, when Antigonus took the tower of Susa, he found in it a golden vine, and a great quantity of other works, to the value of fifteen thousand talents; and out of crowns, and other gifts and spoils, he made up five thousand more. And Polybius (n) relates, that though Molon took the city, yet could not take the fortress, and was obliged to raise the siege, so strong it was. It must be a mistake of Pliny (o) that this city was built by Darius Hystaspes; he could only mean it was rebuilt, or rather enlarged, by him, since it was in being long before his time, and even a royal city in the times of Cyrus. Strabo (p) says it was built by Tithon the father of Merenon, was in compass a fifteen miles, of an oblong figure, and the tower was called after his father's name Mernnonia; and Shushan itself is called, by Herodotus (q), Susa Memnonia. At this day, with the common people, it goes by the name of Tuster (r). The east gate of the mountain of the house, which led to the temple at Jerusalem, was called Shushan. Some say (s) there was a building over this gate, on which the palace of Shushan was portrayed, from whence it had its name. The reason of this portrait is differently given; the Jewish commentators on the Misnah (t) commonly say that this was ordered by the kings of Persia, that the people of Israel might stand in awe of them, and not rebel against them. Their famous lexicographer (u) says, that this was done, that the Israelites, when they saw it, might remember their captivity in it. But a chronologer (w) of theirs gives this as the reason, that the children of the captivity made this figure, that they might remember the miracle of Purim, which was made in Shushan; and this, he says, is a good interpretation of it. This city was in the province of Elam; that is, Persia, as it is also called, <a href="/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a> for Josephus (x) says the Persians had their original from the Elamites, or Elameans; and Pliny (y) observes, that Elymais joined to Persia; and the country of Susiane, so called from Susa its chief city, was, according to Strabo (z) and Ptolemy (a1), a part of Persia: and here Daniel in vision thought himself to be; and a very suitable place for him to have this vision in, which so much concerned the affairs of Persia. <p>And I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai; that is, in vision; it seemed to the prophet that he was upon the banks of the river Ulai; the same with the Eulaeus of Strabo (b1), Pliny (c1), Ptolemy (d1), and others, which ran by, and surrounded, the city of Shushan, or Susa; the water of which was so light, as Strabo (e1) observes, that it was had in great request, and the kings of Persia would drink of no other, and carried it with them wherever they went. Herodotus (f1) and Curtius (g1) make mention of the river Choaspes, as running by Susa, and say the same things of its water; from whence it might be concluded it was one and the same river, called by different names; though Strabo takes notice of them together, as if they were distinct; yet he, from Polycletus (h1), makes them, with Tigris, to disembogue into the same lake, and from thence into the sea. The river which runs by Shushan, now called Souster, according to Monsieur Thevenot (i1), is Caron, and comes from the hills about it, and is thought to be the Choaspes of the ancients; near to which, as he was told, is a hill that now goes by the name of Choasp; so that, upon the whole, they seem to be one and the same river (k1). Josephus says (l1), that Daniel had this vision in the plain of Susa, the metropolis of Persia, as he went out with his friends, that is, out of the city: and the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "by the gate Ulai"; a gate of the city of Shushan so called: and so Saadiah Gaon interprets it a gate; but the former sense is best. <p>(a) Geograph. l. 15. p. 500.

Shushan (Susa) was the capital of Elam. Asshurbanipal (b.c. 668–626) invaded Elam more than once, and has left a full and vivid account of the occasion on which he stormed and sacked Shushan (<span class="ital">KB</span>[319], ii. 203 ff.). Darius Hystaspis appears to have been the first Persian king who erected palaces at Shushan, or held his court there[320]; and from his time onwards, as the principal residence of the Persian kings (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.

Asia and E. Europe awaited their destiny; in the Apadâna tributary princes, ambassadors, and satraps, including the noblest of the Greeks, as Antalkidas (387 and 372), Pelopidas and Ismenias (367), did homage at the feet of the Great King. In the palaces of the citadel were enacted bloody harem-tragedies, in which eunuchs and women were the actors (Esther, Amytis, Amestris, Parysatis, Statira).

N</span>. vi. 27) says flowed close by Susa. The difficulties which were formerly felt in identifying the Eulaeus have been cleared up by the surveys of Loftus and Dieulafoy. There are at present three rivers flowing near Susa, from the mountains on the north, into the Persian Gulf. On the S.-W. of Susa, some four or five miles from the site of the ancient acropolis, flows the Kerkha (the ancient Choaspes): on the east is the Abdizful (the Coprates), which runs into the Karun (the Pasitigris); and the Eulaeus was a large artificial canal some 900 feet broad, of which traces remain, though it is now dry, which left the Choaspes at Pai Pul, about 20 miles N.-W. of Susa, passed close by the town of Susa on the N. or N.-E., and afterwards joined the Coprates.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[321] <span class="ital">B.</span> Eb.

The LXX. presents several slight differences, "And I saw in the vision of my dream, when I was in the city Susa, which is in the province Elymais, and I seemed in my vision to be at the gate Ailam." Theodotion renders more briefly, "And I was in Susa the palace (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), in the province Ailam, and I was on the Ubal." The Syriac is in close agreement with the Massoretic. even to the transcription of the doubtful word <span class="accented">Ubal.</span> The transcription is carried so far that <span class="accented">medeenatha</span>, "a city," is used to translate <span class="accented">m'deena</span>, "a province." Jerome renders <span class="accented">mdeena</span>, <span class="accented">cicitas</span>, and <span class="accented">uval</span>, <span class="accented">portam</span>, and <span class="accented">beera</span>, <span class="accented">castrum.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">oobal</span>) is nearly a <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span>, absolutely so if we do not admit <span class="accented">joobal</span>, in <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>, to be the same word. There is, as will have been seen above, great differences among the versions. The LXX. and Jerome seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">oolam</span>), "porch" or "gate," instead of <span class="accented">oobal.</span> Ewald would make the word mean "river-basin," <span class="accented">Stromgebeit</span> - a view supported also by Zockler. In many respects "marsh" might be a more suitable rendering. To the south-west of the present ruins of Susa there is an extensive marsh, which may have been of old date. The preposition <span class="accented">liphnee</span>, which occurs in ver. 3, is all but meaningless applied to a river, if we use it in its ordinary meaning, "before." If we take it as meaning "eastward," the ram would be "westward" from Shushan, <span class="accented">ie.</span> between Shushan and the river; but as Daniel was in Shushan, he would naturally state the position of the "ram" in relation to it rather than to the river. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">al</span>) is nearly as meaningless with regard to a river, unless a bridge or a boat is intended. We are inclined to read <span class="accented">oolam</span> as "porch." At the same time, we know that there was the river Ulai (Eulaeus) near Shushan. It is mentioned in one of the inscriptions of Asshurbanipal in connection with Shushan (Smith's 'Asshurbanipal,' p. 130). <span class="accented">The palace. B.C.era</span> really seems to mean "fortress." It occurs ten times in Esther, and always as the appellation of Shushan. In Nehemiah it is once used with this connotation, but twice in regard to some building in Jerusalem, probably the temple; in Chronicles it is used for the temple. In <a href="/ezra/6-2.htm">Ezra 6:2</a> it is used of Achmetha, equivalent to Ecbatana. From the fact that the LXX. translates <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, it might be reasoned that the translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> before him, but the translation probably was due to ignorance of the precise meaning of the word. In Esther this word is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. In Nehemiah it is once rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, once it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and once <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The derivation of the word seems to be from the <span class="cmt_word"></span> Assyrian <span class="accented">birtu.</span> It really means "citadel" or "fortress," and thus may be compared with the Carthaginian <span class="accented">byrsa.</span> Jerome's translation, <span class="accented">castrum</span>, suits this. It is not necessary to maintain that at this time Daniel was in Shushan. All that is implied is that in his dream he was there. Shushan is first referred to in the inscriptions of Asshur-bani-pal as the capital of Elam. In the history of that monarch there is an inscription of his given in which he says, "Shushan, the great city, the seat of their gods, the place of their oracle, I captured." Then follows a description of the plunder he took from it. We do not know when it recovered from that overthrow. The name is said to be derived from the number of lilies growing in the neighbourhood; but <span class="accented">shushan</span>, "a lily," is a Shemitie word, and the Elamites are usually regarded as an Aryan people. The association of Babylon with Elam and Media must have been intimate, if any credit is to be placed on the Greek accounts of the marriage of Nebuchadnezzar. Hence, even if Elam was not, at the date specified, a province of the Babylonian Empire, perhaps never was, yet the Babylonian. court might well have envoys visiting the court of Elam. We find from the well-known inscription of Nabunahid, that he regarded Cyrus at first as a friend and deliverer from the formidable Astyages, King of Umman-Manda. Daniel <span class="accented">may</span> have been sent to Elam, although there is no necessity for maintaining that this was the case. It was not until he had conquered Astyages that Cyrus held possession of Shushan. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Chaldeans immediately denounced Daniel's three friends as transgressors of the king's command. &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, therefore, viz., because the friends of Daniel who were placed over the province of Babylon had not, by falling down before the golden image, done it homage. That they did not do so is not expressly said, but is expressed in what follows. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; are not Chaldeans as astrologers of magi (&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;), but members of the Chaldean nation, in contrast to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1488;, the Jews. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, they came near to the king. &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, literally, to eat the flesh of any one, is in Aramaic the common expression for to calumniate, to denounce. That which was odious in their report was, that they used this instance of disobedience to the king's command on the part of the Jewish officers as an occasion of removing them from their offices, - that their denunciation of them arose from their envying the Jews their position of influence, as in <a href="/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5</a> (4)f. Therefore they give prominence to the fact that the king had raised these Jews to places of rule in the province of Babylon.<p>With this form of address in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-9.htm">Daniel 3:9</a>, cf. <a href="/daniel/2-4.htm">Daniel 2:4</a>. &#1496;&#1506;&#1501; &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; signifies in <a href="/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a> rationem reddere, to attend to, to have regard for. In <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-10.htm">Daniel 3:10</a>, as frequently, the expression signifies, on the contrary, to give an opinion, a judgment, i.e., to publish a command. The Keth. &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; (<a href="/daniel/3-12.htm">Daniel 3:12</a>), for which the Keri prefers the sing. form &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1498;, in sound the same as the contracted plur., is to be maintained as correct; for the Keri here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-18.htm">Daniel 3:18</a>, supporting itself on &#1500;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-14.htm">Daniel 3:14</a>, rests on the idea that by the honouring of his god only the doing of homage to the image is meant, while the not doing homage to the image only gives proof of this, that they altogether refused to honour the gods of Nebuchadnezzar. This is placed in the foreground by the accusers, so as to arouse the indignation of the king. "These Chaldeans," Hitz. remarks quite justly, "knew the three Jews, who were so placed as to be well known, and at the same time envied, before this. They had long known that they did not worship idols; but on this occasion, when their religion made it necessary for the Jews to disobey the king's command, they make use of their knowledge."</body></html>
