But why was Daniel absent from the ceremony? His behaviour some years later (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a>) leaves it beyond question that he would not have taken part in any idolatrous rites. Possibly his position as “chief of the wise men” (<a href="/daniel/2-48.htm" title="Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.">Daniel 2:48</a>) made his presence unnecessary. Possibly he was absent on other duties. Two things are certain: (1) the object of the book is not to glorify Daniel; (2) a writer of a fictitious story would have recorded a miracle to deliver Daniel, as well as the three children.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-18 True devotion calms the spirit, quiets and softens it, but superstition and devotion to false gods inflame men's passions. The matter is put into a little compass, Turn, or burn. Proud men are still ready to say, as Nebuchadnezzar, Who is the Lord, that I should fear his power? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not hesitate whether they should comply or not. Life or death were not to be considered. Those that would avoid sin, must not parley with temptation when that to which we are allured or affrighted is manifestly evil. Stand not to pause about it, but say, as Christ did, Get thee behind me, Satan. They did not contrive an evasive answer, when a direct answer was expected. Those who make their duty their main care, need not be anxious or fearful concerning the event. The faithful servants of God find him able to control and overrule all the powers armed against them. Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst. If He be for us, we need not fear what man can do unto us. God will deliver us, either from death or in death. They must obey God rather than man; they must rather suffer than sin; and must not do evil that good may come. Therefore none of these things moved them. The saving them from sinful compliance, was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace, as the saving them out of the fiery furnace was in the kingdom of nature. Fear of man and love of the world, especially want of faith, make men yield to temptation, while a firm persuasion of the truth will deliver them from denying Christ, or being ashamed of him. We are to be meek in our replies, but we must be decided that we will obey God rather than man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego - <a href="/daniel/2-49.htm">Daniel 2:49</a>. It is quite remarkable that the name of Daniel does not occur in the record of this transaction, and that he does not appear to have been involved in the difficulty. Why he was not cannot now be certainly known. We may be sure that he would not join in the worship of the idol, and yet it would seem, as Nebuchadnezzar had summoned all the high officers of the realm to be present <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>, that he must have been summoned also. The conjecture of Prideaux (Con. I. 222) is not improbable, that he occupied a place of so much influence and authority, and enjoyed in so high degree the favor of the king, that they did not think it prudent to begin with him, but rather preferred at first to bring the accusation against subordinate officers. If they were condemned and punished, consistency might require that he should be punished also. If he had been involved at first in the accusation, his high rank, and his favor with the king, might have screened them all from punishment. It is possible, however, that Daniel was absent on the occasion of the dedication of the image. It should be remembered that perhaps some eighteen years had elapsed since the transaction referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> occurred (see the notes at <a href="/daniel/3-1.htm">Daniel 3:1</a>), and Daniel may have been employed in some remote part of the empire on public business. Compare Introduction to the chapter, Section I.VIII.<p>These men, O king, have not regarded thee - Margin, "set no regard upon." Literally, "they have not placed toward thee the decree;" that is, they have not made any account of it; they have paid no attention to it.<p>They serve not thy gods - Perhaps it was inferred from the fact that they would not pay religious homage to "this" idol, that they did not serve the gods at all that were acknowledged by the king; or possibly this may have been known from what had occurred before. It may have been well understood in Babylon, that the Hebrews worshipped Jehovah only. Now, however, a case had occurred which was a "test" case, whether they would on any account render homage to the idols that were worshipped in Babylon. In their refusal to worship the idol, it seemed much to aggravate the offence, and made the charge much more serious, that they did not acknowledge "any" of the gods that were worshipped in Babylon. It was easy, therefore, to persuade the king that they had arrayed themselves against the fundamental laws of the realm. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. serve not thy gods&#8212;not only not the golden image, but also not any of Nebuchadnezzar's gods.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Now the devil’s cloven foot appears, now ye have the bottom of the plot; one of these two is clear: these Chaldeans finding the Jews made courtiers, and preferred to places of trust and honour, they either put the king upon this work, or else made use of it, both to satisfy their ambition and wreak their malice against those three worthies; as they dealt with Daniel, <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/6-4.htm" title="Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; for as much as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.">Daniel 6:4</a>,5</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They accused the Jews; </span> which word signifies to calumniate, and also to eat up and devour, which is the design of envy and malice.

The Jews, who do not show all the respect that is due unto Daniel, say (n) some very idle and foolish things of him, as reasons why he was not present at this time. It is asked, <p>"where did Daniel go? says Rab, to dig a large river in Tiberias; some copies read, in a mountain; but Samuel says, to fetch the seed of herbs, food for beasts; and R. Jochanan says, to fetch swine from Alexandria in Egypt there were three in the consultation about his absence at this time, the holy blessed God, Nebuchadnezzar, and Daniel himself. The holy blessed God said, let Daniel be gone, that it may not be said, they (the three children) were delivered by his merits; Daniel said, I will be gone from hence, that I may not fulfil that, "the graven images of their gods shall ye burn"; Nebuchadnezzar said, let Daniel be absent, that it may not be said he burnt his God in the fire.'' <p>These men, O king, have not regarded thee; showed no respect to his person and authority; they disobeyed his orders, and were guilty of rebellion against him, and contempt of majesty: the proof follows, <p>they serve not thy gods; whom the king and the nation worshipped, as Bel, Nebo, Merodach, and others: <p>nor worship the golden image, which thou hast set up; they did not bow down to it, in reverence of it, as had been ordered; this they knew would he most provoking to the king. <p>(n) T.

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, This is the boundary according to which ye shall divide the land among you for an inheritance, for Joseph portions. <a href="/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>. And ye shall receive it for an inheritance, one as well as another, because I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers; and thus shall this land fall to you for an inheritance. <a href="/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. And this is the boundary of the land: toward the north side, from the great sea onwards by the way to Chetlon, in the direction of Zedad; <a href="/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>. Hamath, Berotah, Sibraim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath, the central Hazer, which is on the boundary of Haruan. <a href="/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a>. And the boundary from the sea shall be Hazar-Enon, the boundary town of Damascus; and as for the north northwards, Hamath is the boundary. This, the north side. <a href="/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>. And the east side between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the boundary to the eastern sea ye shall measure. This, the east side. <a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>. And the south side toward the south; from Tamar to the water of strife, Kadesh, along the brook to the great sea. This, the south side toward the south. <a href="/ezekiel/47-20.htm">Ezekiel 47:20</a>. And the west side; the great sea from the boundary to Hamath. This, the west side. <a href="/ezekiel/47-21.htm">Ezekiel 47:21</a>. This land shall ye divide among you according to the tribes of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a>. And it shall come to pass, ye shall divide it by lot among yourselves for an inheritance, and among the foreigners who dwell in the midst of you, who have begotten sons in the midst of you; they shall be to you like natives born among the sons of Israel; they shall cast lots with you for an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. <a href="/ezekiel/47-23.htm">Ezekiel 47:23</a>. And it shall come to pass, in the tribe in which the foreigner dwells, there shall ye give him his inheritance, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.<p>The fixing of the boundary of the land which Israel was to divide in future according to its twelve tribes is commenced (<a href="/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a>) and concluded (<a href="/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47-23.htm">Ezekiel 47:23</a>) with certain general statements concerning the distribution. The introductory statements are attached to the heading "this is the boundary," which is therefore repeated in <a href="/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1492; is evidently a copyist's error for &#1494;&#1492;, which is adopted by all the older translators, contained in some Codd., and demanded by &#1493;&#1494;&#1492; in <a href="/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; stands here for the whole of the boundary of the land to be distributed; and &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; which follows is an accusative, "according to which." - "According to the twelve tribes," - for all Israel is to return and dwell as one people of God under one prince in its own land (<a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>., <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>.). But the division among the twelve tribes is more precisely defined immediately afterwards by the clause abruptly appended, "Joseph portions," i.e., two portions for Joseph. There can be no doubt that this is the meaning of the words in accordance with <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14</a>, <a href="/joshua/17-17.htm">Joshua 17:17</a>. Hence the notice-like form of the expression, which should not be obliterated by pointing &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; as a dual, &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. If the land was to be divided by lot according to twelve tribes, and the tribe of Levi was to receive its portion from the terumah which was set apart, Joseph must necessarily receive two hereditary portions for his sons Ephraim and Manasseh, in accordance with the appointment of the patriarch in <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>. The commencement of <a href="/ezekiel/47-14.htm">Ezekiel 47:14</a> is not at variance with this, as Hitzig imagines; for the words, "ye shall receive it for an inheritance, one as another," simply affirm, that of the twelve tribes reckoned by Israel in relation to the &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, all were to receive equal shares, the one as much as the other. As the reason for this command to divide the land, allusion is made to the oath with which God promised to give this land to the fathers (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/20-28.htm">Ezekiel 20:28</a>).<p>The definition of the boundaries commences with <a href="/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a>. In form it differs in many points from <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1-5</a>, but in actual fact it is in harmony with the Mosaic definition. In <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a> the description commences with the southern boundary, then proceeds to the western and northern boundaries, and closes with the eastern. In Ezekiel it commences with the northern boundary and proceeds to the east, the south, and the west. This difference may be explained in a very simple manner, from the fact that the Israelites in the time of Moses came from Egypt i.e., marching from the south, and stood by the south-eastern boundary of the land, whereas at this time they were carried away into the northern lands Assyria and Babylon, and were regarded as returning thence. Again, in Ezekiel the boundaries are described much more briefly than in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a>, the northern boundary alone being somewhat more circumstantially described. The course which it takes is represented in a general manner in <a href="/ezekiel/47-15.htm">Ezekiel 47:15</a> as running from the great sea, i.e., the Mediterranean, by the way to Chetlon, in the direction toward Zedad. In <a href="/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a> there follow the places which formed the boundary. The starting-point on the Mediterranean Sea can only be approximately determined, as the places mentioned, Chetlon and Zedad, are still unknown. Not only Chetlon, but Zedad also, has not yet been discovered. The city of Sadad (Sudud), to the east of the road leading from Damascus to Hums (Emesa), which Robinson and Wetzstein suppose to be the same, lies much too far toward the east to be used in defining the boundary either here or in <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a> (see the comm. on <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>). Among the names enumerated in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>, &#1495;&#1502;&#1514; is not the city of Hamah on the Orontes, which lay much too far to the north, but the kingdom of Hamath, the southern boundary of which formed the northern boundary of Canaan, though it cannot be given with exactness. Berothah is probably identical with Berothai in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>, a city of the king of Zobah; but the situation of it is still unknown. Sibraim may perhaps be identical with Ziphron in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-9.htm">Numbers 34:9</a>, which has also not yet been discovered, and is not to be sought for in the ruins of Zifran, to the north-east of Damascus, near the road to Palmyra; for that place could not form the boundary of Damascus and Hamath. The situation of the "central Hazer" has also not yet been determined. Hauran, on the boundary of which it stood, is used here in a more comprehensive sense that  &#787;&#x391;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; in Josephus and other Greek authors, and includes the later Auranitis, together with Gaulanitis (Golan) and Batanaea (Bashan), and probably also Ituraea, as only Damascus and Gilead are named in <a href="/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a> in addition to Hauran, on the east side of the Jordan; so that the whole tract of land between the territory of Damascus and the country of Gilead is embraced by the name Hauran. &#1495;&#1493;&#1512;&#1503;, Arab. Hawra&#770;n, is derived from the number of caves (&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;, &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) in that district, to which Wetzstein (Reiseber. p. 92) indeed raises the objection that with the exception of the eastern and south-eastern Hauran, where no doubt most of the volcanic hills have been perforated by troglodytes, the dwellings in caves are by no means common in that region. But the name may have originated in this eastern district, and possibly have included even that portion of Gilead which was situated to the north of the Jabbok, namely, Erbed and Sut, the true cave-country. For further remarks concerning these districts, see the comm. on <a href="/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a>, "the boundary from the sea shall be Hazar-Enon, the boundary of Damascus," cannot have any other meaning than that the northern boundary, which started from the Mediterranean Sea, stretched as far as Hazar-Enon, the frontier city of Damascus, or that Hazar-Enon formed the terminal point on the east, toward the boundary of Damascus, for the northern boundary proceeding from the sea. &#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503; or &#1495;&#1510;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1503; (<a href="/numbers/34-9.htm">Numbers 34:9</a>), i.e., spring-court, we have endeavoured to identify in the comm. on <a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a> with the spring Lebweh, which lies in the Beka at the watershed between the Orontes and the Leontes; and the designation "the boundary of Damascus" suits the situation very well. <a href="/ezekiel/47-17.htm">Ezekiel 47:17</a> has been aptly explained by Hitzig thus, in accordance with the literal meaning of the words, "and as for the north north-wards, Hamath is the boundary," which he further elucidates by observing that &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; is intended as a supplementary note to the boundary line from west to east, which is indicated just before. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503; is a concluding formula: "this, the north side." But &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; (here and <a href="/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>) is not to be altered into &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; after <a href="/ezekiel/47-20.htm">Ezekiel 47:20</a> and the Syriac version, as Hitzig supposes, but to be explained, as <a href="/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a> clearly shows, on the supposition that Ezekiel had &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "ye shall measure," floating before his mind, to which '&#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1508;, "and that the northern boundary," would form a correct logical sequel.<p>The eastern boundary is defined in v. 18 in the same manner as in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-10.htm">Numbers 34:10-12</a>, except that in the latter it is more minutely described above the Lake of Gennesaret by the mention of several localities, whereas Ezekiel only names the Jordan as the boundary. - &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; , with supplementary remarks, is not to be taken as the predicate to the subject &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503;, as Hitzig has correctly observed; for the meaning of &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; does not allow of this. The explanation is rather this: as for the east side, between Hauran, etc. and the land of Israel, is the Jordan. Hauran, Damascus, and Gilead lie on the east side of the Jordan, the land of Israel on the west side. The striking circumstance that Ezekiel commences with Hauran, which lay in the middle between Damascus and Gilead, - Hauran, Damascus, and Gilead, instead of Damascus, Hauran, and Gilead, - may probably be explained from the fact that the Jordan, which he names as the boundary, for the sake of brevity, did not extend so far upwards as to the territory of Damascus, but simply formed the boundary of the land of Israel between Hauran and Gilead. &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; points back to the northern boundary already mentioned. From this boundary, the eastern terminal point of which was Hazar-Enon, they are to measure to the eastern sea, i.e., to the Dead Sea.<p><a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>. The southern boundary toward the south is to proceed from Tamar to the water of strife, Kadesh, (and thence) along the brook to the great (i.e., Mediterranean) sea. Tamar, a different place from Hazazon-tamar, called Engedi in <a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a> (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>), is supposed to be the Thamara (&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;),<p>(Note: The statement runs thus: &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3a7;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;, &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. In Jerome: est et aliud castellum, unius diei itinere a Mampsis oppido separatum, pergentibus Ailiam de Chebron, ubi nunc romanum praesidium positum est. But on account of the &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (Mampsis), which is evidently a corruption, the passage is obscure. Robinson's conjecture concerning Thamara is founded upon the assumption that the reading should be &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and that this is the Malatha mentioned by later writers as the station of a Roman cohort.)<p>which was a day's journey on the road from Hebron to Aelam (Aelath, <a href="/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), according to Eusebius in the Onomast. ed. Lars. p. 68, and had a Roman garrison; and Robinson (Pal. III pp. 178 and 186ff.) accordingly conjectures that it is to be found in the ruins of Kurnub, which lie six hours' journey to the south of Milh, toward the pass of es-Sufh. But this conjecture is bound up with various assumptions of a very questionable character, and the situation of Hurnub hardly suits the Tamar of our passage, which should be sought, not to the west of the southern point of the Dead Sea, but, according to the southern boundary of Canaan as drawn in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3-5</a>, to the south of the Dead Sea. The waters of strife of Kadesh (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>), in the desert of Zin, were near Kadesh-barnea, which was in the neighbourhood of the spring Ain Kades, discovered by Rowland to the south of Bir-Seba and Khalasa by the fore-courts of Jebel Helal, i.e., at the north-west corner of the mountain land of the Azazimeh (see the comm. on <a href="/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>, and <a href="/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>). Instead of &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; we have the singular &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>, as in <a href="/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/32-51.htm">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; is to be pointed &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; with &#1492; loc.; and the reference is to the brook of Egypt; the great wady el-Arish ( &#788;&#x3a1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), along which the southern boundary of Canaan ran from Kadesh to the Mediterranean Sea (see the comm. on <a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>). - <a href="/ezekiel/47-20.htm">Ezekiel 47:20</a>. The Mediterranean Sea formed the western boundary. &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, i.e., from the southern boundary mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a> till opposite (&#1506;&#1491;) to the coming to Hamath, i.e., till opposite to the point at which one enters the territory of Hamath (Hitzig), i.e., the spot mentioned in <a href="/ezekiel/47-20.htm">Ezekiel 47:20</a> (? 17) as the commencement of the northern boundary in the neighbourhood of the promontory of esh-Shkah between Byblus (Gebal) and Tripolis. - <a href="/ezekiel/47-21.htm">Ezekiel 47:21</a>. This land they are to divide among them according to their tribes. With this remark, which points back to <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, the definition of the boundaries is brought to a close. There is simply added in <a href="/ezekiel/47-22.htm">Ezekiel 47:22</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47-23.htm">Ezekiel 47:23</a> a further regulation concerning the foreigners living in Israel. The law of Moses had already repeatedly urged upon the Israelites affectionate treatment of them, and in <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> the command is given to treat them like natives in this respect, and to love them. But the full right of citizenship was not thereby conceded to them, so that they could also acquire property in land. The land was given to the Israelites alone for an hereditary possession. Foreigners could only be incorporated into the congregation of Israel under the limitations laid down in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2-9</a>, by the reception of circumcision. But in the future distribution of the land, on the contrary, the &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; were to receive hereditary property like native-born Israelites; and in this respect no difference was to exist between the members of the people of God born of Abraham's seed and those born of the heathen. At the same time, this right was not to be conferred upon every foreigner who might be only temporarily living in Israel, but to those alone who should beget sons in the midst of Israel, i.e., settle permanently in the holy land. The Kal &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is not to be altered into the Hiphil &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, as Hitzig proposes, but is used in the sense of receiving by lot, derived from the Hiphil signification, "to apportion by lot." </body></html>
