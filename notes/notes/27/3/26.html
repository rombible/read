He will likewise let them know who are his servants, and that he owns them, and will stand by them. Nebuchadnezzar now embraces those whom he had abandoned to destruction, and is ready to show them every possible kindness, perceiving them to be the favourites of Heaven.

Those who worshipped the beast and his image, have no rest, no pause, no moment free from pain, Re 14:10,11. Now was fulfilled in the letter that great promise, Isa 43:2, When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned. Leaving it to that God who preserved them in the fire, to bring them out, they walked up and down in the midst, supported and encouraged by the presence of the Son of God. Those who suffer for Christ, have his presence in their sufferings, even in the fiery furnace, and in the valley of the shadow of death. Nebuchadnezzar owns them for servants of the most high God; a God able to deliver them out of his hand. It is our God only is the consuming fire, Heb 12:29. Could we but see into the eternal world, we should behold the persecuted believer safe from the malice of his foes, while they are exposed to the wrath of God, and tormented in unquenchable fires.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth ... - Margin, "door." The Chaldee word means door, gate, entrance. The "form" of the furnace is unknown. There was a place, however, through which the fuel was cast into it, and this is doubtless intended by the word "door" or "mouth" here used.<p>Ye servants of the most high God - They had professed to be his servants; he now saw that they were acknowledged as such. The phrase "most high God" implies that he regarded him as supreme over all other gods, though it is probable that he still retained his belief in the existence of inferior divinities. It was much, however, to secure the acknowledgment of the monarch of the capital of the pagan world, that the God whom they adored was supreme. The phrase "most high God" is not often employed in the Scriptures, but in every instance it is used as an appellation of the true God.<p>Come forth, and come hither - The "reasons" which seem to have influenced this singular monarch to recal the sentence passed on them, and to attempt to punish them no further, seem to have been, that he had some remains of conscience; that he was accustomed to pay respect to what "he" regarded as God; and that he now saw evidence that a "true" God was there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. the most high God&#8212;He acknowledges Jehovah to be supreme above other gods (not that he ceased to believe in these); so he returns to his original confession, "your God is a God of gods" (Da 2:47), from which he had swerved in the interim, perhaps intoxicated by his success in taking Jerusalem, whose God he therefore thought unable to defend it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Came near; </span> as near as he durst come, within hearing. <span class="ital">And spake</span> with a milder tone than before, God having abated the fire of his fury.

Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the</span> fire. The variations of the Septuagint Version here arc inconsiderable. Instead of "spake and said," it renders, "called them by name," and omits the second repetition of the names, and the pleonastic "come hither;" instead of "Most High God," it has"God of gods Most High." Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text; the only differnce is that "spake" is omitted. The Peshitta and Vulgate are in exact accordance with the Massoretic. The distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is "go out" and "come." It is well rendered in our Authorized Verb-ion. only there was no need of "hither" being put in <span class="accented">italics.</span> As above mentioned, this shows the form of the furnace to be not unlike our own - open at the top, but having a door at the side. It was to this side door that the king approached. The fact that Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges Jehovah to be "Most High God" does not imply any recognition of his supreme Divinity, any more than a king of France acknowledged the supremacy of the head of the Holy Roman Empire. when in the credentials of his ambassador the emperor was called <span class="accented">Dominus urbis et orbis.</span> It was simply a matter of what we may call religious etiquette to address gods of the higher class as "god of gods." and "god most high." In <a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> Nebuchadnezzar had already declared the God of Daniel to be "God of gods" It is not impossible that to the Babylonians '<span class="accented">illa'a</span> might have the appearance of a proper name. </body></html>
