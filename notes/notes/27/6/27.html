The expression, whose name was Belteshazzar (<a href="/daniel/2-26.htm">Daniel 2:26</a>), intimates in this connection that he who was known among the Jews by the name Daniel was known to the Chaldean king only under the name given to him by the conqueror - that Nebuchadnezzar knew of no Daniel, but only of Belteshazzar. The question, "art thou able?" i.e., has thou ability? does not express the king's ignorance of the person of Daniel, but only his amazement at his ability to make known the dream, in the sense, "art thou really able?" This amazement Daniel acknowledges as justified, for he replies that no wise man was able to do this thing. In the enumeration of the several classes of magicians the word &#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; is the general designation of them all. "But there is a God in heaven." Daniel "declares in the presence of the heathen the existence of God, before he speaks to him of His works." Klief. But when he testifies of a God in heaven as One who is able to reveal hidden things, he denies this ability eo ipso to all the so-called gods of the heathen. Thereby he not only assigns the reason of the inability of the heathen wise men, who knew not the living God in heaven, to show the divine mysteries, but he refers also all the revelations which the heathen at any time receive to the one true God. The  &#1493;in &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; introduces the development of the general thought. That there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, Daniel declares to the king by this, that he explains his dream as an inspiration of this God, and shows to him its particular circumstances. God made known to him in a dream "what would happen in the end of the days." &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;  equals  &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; designates here not the future generally (Hv.), and still less "that which comes after the days, a time which follows after another time, comprehended under the &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;" (Klief.), but the concluding future or the Messianic period of the world's time; see <a href="/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>.<p>From &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; in <a href="/daniel/2-29.htm">Daniel 2:29</a> that general interpretation of the expression is not proved. The expression &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; of <a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a> is not explained by the &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1492; of <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-29.htm">Daniel 2:29</a>, but this &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; relates to Nebuchadnezzar's thoughts of a future in the history of the world, to which God, the revealer of secrets, unites His Messianic revelations; moreover, every Messianic future event is also an &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. <a href="/daniel/2-45.htm">Daniel 2:45</a>), without, however, every &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; being also Messianic, though it may become so when at the same time it is a constituent part of the future experience and the history of Israel, the people of the Messianic promise (Kran.). "The visions of thy head" (cf. <a href="/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a> [5], <a href="/daniel/4-7.htm">Daniel 4:7</a> [10], <a href="/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10</a> [13], <a href="/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>) are not dream-visions because they formed themselves in the head or brains (v. Leng., Maur., Hitz.), which would thus be only phantoms or fancies. The words are not a poetic expression for dreams hovering about the head (Hv.); nor yet can we say, with Klief., that "the visions of thy head upon thy bed, the vision which thou sawest as thy head lay on thy pillow," mean only dream-visions. Against the former interpretation this may be stated, that dreams from God do not hover about the head; and against the latter, that the mention of the head would in that case be superfluous. The expression, peculiar to Daniel, designates much rather the divinely ordered visions as such, "as were perfectly consistent with a thoughtfulness of the head actively engaged" (Kran.). The singular &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; goes back to &#1495;&#1500;&#1502;&#1498; (thy dream) as a fundamental idea, and is governed by &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1493;&#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1497; in the sense: "thy dream with the visions of thy head;" cf. Winer, 49, 6. The plur. &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1497; is used, because the revelation comprehends a series of visions of future events.</body></html>
