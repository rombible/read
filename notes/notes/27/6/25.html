And well might this decree be prefaced, as it is, with <span class="ital">Peace be multiplied unto you; </span>for the only foundation of true peace and happiness is laid in the fear of God. But though this decree goes far, it does not go far enough: had he done right, and acted according to his present convictions, he would have commanded all men, not only to <span class="ital">tremble </span>and <span class="ital">fear </span>before this God, but to trust in, love, and obey him, to forsake the service of their idols, and to call upon and worship him only, as Daniel did. But idolatry had been so long and so deeply rooted, that it was not to be extirpated by the edicts of princes, nor by any power less than that which accompanied the glorious gospel of Christ. <span class="ital">For he is the living God, </span>&c. — Darius here mentions the considerations which moved him to make this decree; and, in doing this, he presents us with a very just and sublime character of the true God, — a character suited to his nature, and probably such as the king had learned of Daniel. Some think he was a convert to the true religion; if so, this, together with the favours shown to the prophet, may in some measure account for the notice taken of his reign. Certainly the reasons on which he here grounds his decree, were sufficient to have justified one for the total suppression of idolatry. <span class="ital">He delivereth and rescueth, </span>&c. — He has an ability sufficient to support his authority and dominion, delivering his faithful servants from trouble, and rescuing them out of the hands of their enemies. <span class="ital">He worketh signs and wonders, </span>quite above the power of nature to effect, both <span class="ital">in heaven and earth — </span>By which it appears that he is sovereign Lord of both: <span class="ital">who hath delivered Daniel from the lions — </span>This miracle, and that of delivering Shadrach and his companions, were wrought in the eye of the world; were seen, published, and attested, by two of the greatest monarchs that ever existed: and were illustrious confirmations of the first principles of religion, abstracted from the narrow scheme of Judaism, effectual confutations of all the errors of heathenism, and very proper preparations for pure catholic Christianity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/daniel/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:25-28 If we live in the fear of God, and walk according to that rule, peace shall be upon us.

If there is a probability that Nebuchadnezzar would make such a proclamation as he did, there is no less probability that the same thing would be done by Darius. Indeed, it is manifest on the face of the whole narrative that one great design of all that occurred was to proclaim the knowledge of the true God, and to secure his recognition. That object was worthy of the Divine interposition, and the facts in the case show that God has power to induce princes and rulers to recognize his existence and perfections, and his government over the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</span> This decree has a resemblance to the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar. In the Septuagint there is less magniloquence, though the divergence is too great to be the result merely of difference of reading, "<span class="accented">Then</span> Darius wrote to all nations and tongues and countries dwelling in all his land, saying, Let all men who are in my kingdom stand and worship, and serve the God of Daniel, for he alone abideth, and liveth to generations of generations for ever. I Darius will worship and serve him all my days, for none of the idols that are made with hands are able to deliver as the God of Daniel did Daniel." It is to be observed that it is only to the inhabitants of his own land that Darius writes, and further, it is "all men in his kingdom" he commands, not "every dominion in his kingdom." There is no notice taken of the kingdom of God; it is God himself who liveth and abideth for ever. The last verse, again, in the Septuagint, in which Darius professes his faith in Jehovah, is evidently spurious. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. Removing the exaggerations from it, the decree of Darius does not mean any more than we found in the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar; it is simply a warning against showing any disrespect to a Deity with such formidable powers as Jehovah. It may be regarded as connected with the dualistic view of the universe maintained by Zoroastrianism, that deliverance from lions is spoken of with such awe. The lion was one of the beasts specially representative of the evil principle, as we see in Persepolis. There was thus evidence given that the God of the Jews was supreme over the powers of evil; therefore, without forbidding any subject of Babylonia from worshipping his own ancestral divinity. Darius yet commanded him, in so doing, to watch his conduct, so that nothing disrespectful to the powerful God of the Hebrews should be done by him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hereupon Daniel announced to the king that he was prepared to make known to him the dream with its interpretation. &#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;, for that very reason, viz., because God had revealed to him the king's matter, Daniel was brought in by Arioch before the king; for no one had free access to the king except his immediate servants. &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, he went, takes up inconsequenter the &#1506;&#1500; (intravit), which is separated by a long sentence, so as to connect it with what follows.
