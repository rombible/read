The short triumph of the wicked will end in their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My God hath sent his angel - It was common among the Hebrews to attribute any remarkable preservation from danger to the intervention of an angel sent from God, and no one can demonstrate that it did not occur as they supposed. There is no more absurdity in supposing that God employs an angelic being to defend his people, or to impart blessings to them, than there is in supposing that he employs one human being to render important aid, and to convey important blessings, to another. As a matter of fact, few of the favors which God bestows upon men are conveyed to them directly from himself, but they are mostly imparted by the instrumentality of others. So it is in the blessings of liberty, in deliverance from bondage, in the provision made for our wants, in the favor bestowed on us in infancy and childhood. As this principle prevails everywhere on the earth, it is not absurd to suppose that it may prevail elsewhere, and that on important occasions, and in instances above the rank of human intervention, God may employ the instrumentality of higher beings to defend his people in trouble, and rescue them from danger. Compare <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-10.htm">Matthew 18:10</a>; <a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>. Daniel does not say whether the angel was visible or not, but it is rather to be presumed that he was, as in this way it would be more certainly known to him that he owed his deliverance to the intervention of an angel, and as this would be to him a manifest token of the favor and protection of God.<p>And hath shut the lions' mouths - It is clear that Daniel supposed that this was accomplished by a miracle; and this is the only satisfactory solution of what had occurred. There is, moreover, no more objection to the supposition that this was a miracle than there is to any miracle whatever, for<p>(a) there is no more fitting occasion for the Divine intervention than when a good man is in danger, and<p>(b) the object to be accomplished on the mind of the king, and through him on the minds of the people at large, was worthy of such an interposition.<p>The design was evidently to impress the mind of the monarch with the belief of the existence of the true God, and to furnish in the court of Babylon proof that should be convincing that he is the only God.<p>Forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me - <p>(1) Absolute innocency in reference to the question of guilt on the point in which he had been condemned - he having done only what God approved; and<p>(2) general integrity and uprightness of character. We need not suppose that Daniel claimed to be absolutely perfect (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>), but we may suppose that he means to say that God saw that he was what he professed to be, and that his life was such as he approved.<p>And also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt - That is, he had in no manner violated his duty to the king; he had done nothing that tended to overthrow his government, or to spread disaffection among his subjects. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. his angel&#8212;the instrument, not the author, of his deliverance (Ps 91:11; 34:7).<p>shut &#8230; lions' mouths&#8212;(Heb 11:33). So spiritually, God will shut the roaring lion's mouth (1Pe 5:8) for His servants.<p>forasmuch as before him innocency&#8212;not absolutely (in Da 9:7, 18 he disclaims such a plea), but relatively to this case.

Daniel takes up the king's expression, and confirms it; he asserts God to be his God, of which he had given him a proof in sending his angel to him that night; either one of the ministering spirits about him, or the Angel of the covenant, the same with him, said to be like the Son of God, that was seen in the fiery furnace, even the Messiah in human form: <p>and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me; by taking away hunger from them, or by striking terror into them; so that they had either no inclination to hurt him, or were afraid of him: <p>forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; either before God, or before his Angel, Daniel appeared to be an innocent and righteous person; therefore the Lord pleaded his cause, and made it to appear that he was just, and his cause good; for this is not to be understood of the merits of his works, and the causality of them to justify and save; for here he is speaking not of the righteousness of his person, but of his cause; and not of eternal, but temporal salvation: <p>and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt: either to his person or government; nothing that was criminal and sinful, but what was just and right, serving daily his God; and this was plain to the king, what he knew and owned; and though he had acted contrary to the decree the lords had craftily obtained, yet it was not out of disrespect to the king, but in obedience to his God; and in doing of which he had done nothing prejudicial to the king's interest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> no hurt.</span><p>(h) My just cause and uprightness in this thing in which I was charged, is approved by God.<p>(i) For he disobeyed the kings's wicked commandment in order to obey God, and so he did no injury to the king, who ought to command nothing by which God would be dishonoured.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">sent his angel</span>] cf. <a href="/daniel/3-28.htm" title="Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.">Daniel 3:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shut</span> &c.] cf. <a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm" title="Who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.">Hebrews 11:33</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἔφραξαν</span>; Theod. here <span class="greekheb">ἐνέφραξεν</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before thee</span>] see on <span class="ital"><a href="/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a></span> <span class="ital">end</span>, and <a href="/daniel/2-9.htm" title="But if you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof.">Daniel 2:9</a>; and cf. <a href="/luke/15-18.htm" title="I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before you,">Luke 15:18</a>; <a href="/luke/15-21.htm" title="And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight, and am no more worthy to be called your son.">Luke 15:21</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The evidence of the wisdom and power of God is here unfolded; and firs the manifestation of His power.

God's unlimited control over seasons and times is seen in this, that He sets up and casts down kings. Thus Daniel explains the revelation regarding the dream of Nebuchadnezzar made to him as announcing great changes in the kingdoms of the world, and revealing God as the Lord of time and of the world in their developments. All wisdom also comes from God. He gives to men disclosures regarding His hidden counsels. This Daniel had just experienced.
