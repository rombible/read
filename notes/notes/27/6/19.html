We are sure of what the king doubted, that the servants of the living God have a Master well able to protect them. See the power of God over the fiercest creatures, and believe his power to restrain the roaring lion that goeth about continually seeking to devour. Daniel was kept perfectly safe, because he believed in his God. Those who boldly and cheerfully trust in God to protect them in the way of duty, shall always find him a present help. Thus the righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.

And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Darnel O Daniel servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</span> "Very early" is really "the glimmer of day;" (<span class="accented">shapharpara</span>). The word used occurs in the Targums. It may, however, be doubted whether the word here is not the Syriac <span class="accented">shapbra.</span> The writing here presents so many peculiarities that suspicion is forced upon the reader. The first <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;</span> is small, and the second is large. There is the further difficulty that <span class="accented">nogah is</span> nearly equivalent to <span class="accented">shaphra.</span> One might suspect a doublet, as Behrmann maintains, here, did not the versions indicate something like this as the meaning of this clause. <span class="accented">A lamentable voice</span> (<span class="accented">atzeeb</span>) seems to mean "sad" or "grieved." The version of the Septuagint shows traces of addition, "And King Darius rose early in the morning, and took with him the satraps, and went and stood at the mouth of the den of lions. Then the king called to Daniel with a loud voice, with weeping, saying, O Daniel, if thou art alive, and thy God whom thou servest continually, hath he saved thee from the lions? and have they not harmed thee?" It is possible the addition of "the satraps" may have been due to <span class="accented">shapharpara</span> being read <span class="accented">ahashdarpnayya.</span> Certainly if the purpose of the double scaling was what it is assigned to be in the first verse, then the satraps would accompany him; only the suggestion is such a natural one that it might readily slip into the text. Ver. 20 (21) in the LXX. has traces of expansion. The omission of <span class="accented">yekeel</span> and the change of <span class="accented">sheezab</span> to the finite preterite is possible enough, and may indicate that in the original text the word rendered "able" was not found. Theodotion renders ver. 19 (20) in accordance with the Massoretic reading, but, in ver. 20 (21) instead of "lamentable voice," has "strong voice," a reading that seems somewhat confirmed by the LXX. Further, he translates the interrogative <span class="accented">ha</span> as if it were the Hebrew <span class="accented">kee</span>, "if." The Peshitta, though agreeing in the nineteenth verse with the Massoretic, has some minor differences in the following verse - "high voice" instead of "lamentable voice," and "faithfully" instead of "continually." The Vulgate singularly inserts in ver. 20 <span class="accented">putasne</span>? "dost thou think?" That Darius should thus  hasten in the semi-darkness of the first glimmer of dawn to the lions' den to see whether Daniel were yet alive, was but natural. As the sealing of the lions' den suggested the sealing of the holy sepulchre, so the hastening of Darius to the den in the earliest dawn suggests the action of the women who got up "a great while before day." When Darius calls Daniel the "servant of the living God," there is no necessary confession of faith in him on the part of the king. It is for him simply an act of politeness to a Deity who, if this were neglected, might resent. It is to be noted that this attribute "living" is omitted in the Septuagint. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The final clause depends on &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; (<a href="/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17</a>). The &#1493; is to be interpreted as explicative: and indeed, or namely. Against this interpretation it cannot be objected, with Hitz., that Daniel also prayed. He and his friends thus prayed to God that He would grant a revelation of the secret, i.e., of the mysterious dream and its interpretation. The designation "God of heaven" occurs in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-7.htm">Genesis 24:7</a>, where it is used of Jehovah; but it was first commonly used as the designation of the almighty and true God in the time of the exile (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-10.htm">Ezra 6:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>, <a href="/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-4.htm">Nehemiah 2:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-26.htm">Psalm 136:26</a>), who, as Daniel names Him (<a href="/daniel/5-23.htm">Daniel 5:23</a>), is the Lord of heaven; i.e., the whole heavens, with all the stars, which the heathen worshipped as gods, are under His dominion.</body></html>
