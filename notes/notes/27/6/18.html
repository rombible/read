Daniel was kept perfectly safe, because he believed in his God. Those who boldly and cheerfully trust in God to protect them in the way of duty, shall always find him a present help. Thus the righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. The short triumph of the wicked will end in their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting - Daniel was probably cast into the den soon after the going down of the sun, <a href="/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14</a>. It was not unusual to have suppers then late at night, as it is now in many places. The great anxiety of the king, however, on account of what had occurred, prevented him from participating in the usual evening meal. As to the probability of what is here affirmed, no one can have any doubt who credits the previous statements. In the consciousness of wrong done to a worthy officer of the government; in the deep anxiety which he had to deliver him; in the excitement which must have existed against the cunning and wicked authors of the plot to deceive the king and to ruin Daniel; and in his solicitude and hope that after all Daniel might escape, there is a satisfactory reason for the facts stated that he had no desire for food; that instruments of music were not brought before him; and that he passed a sleepless night.<p>Neither were instruments of music brought before him - It was usual among the ancients to have music at their meals. This custom prevailed among the Greeks and Romans, and doubtless was common in the Oriental world. It should be observed, however, that there is considerable variety in the interpretation of the word here rendered instruments of music - &#1491;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;  dacha&#774;va&#770;n. The margin is table. The Latin Vulgate, "He slept supperless, neither was food brought before him." The Greek renders it "food," &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  edesmata. So the Syriac. Bertholdt and Gesenius render it concubines, and Saadias dancing girls. Any of these significations would be appropriate; but it is impossible to determine which is the most correct. The word does not occur elsewhere in the Scriptures. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/daniel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. neither were instruments of music, &c.&#8212;Gesenius translates, "concubines." Daniel's mentioning to us as an extraordinary thing of Darius, that he neither approached his table nor his harem, agrees with Xenophon's picture of him as devoted to wine and women, vain, and without self-control. He is sorry for the evil which he himself had caused, yet takes no steps to remedy it. There are many such halters between good and bad, who are ill at ease in their sins, yet go forward in them, and are drawn on by others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/daniel/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Passed the night fasting; </span> yea, and without instruments of music and sleep. The king was in perplexity, he was under great conviction that he had done very dishonourably and cruelly, by hearkening to the counsel of his wicked courtiers; he should have rescinded his rash decree, and rated them for their barbarity against Daniel, and have overruled them, and let him out; he is convinced of all this, and grieves for it, but to little purpose. Many are displeased with themselves for their vices, yet are drawn away with them; and, upon a point of honour, or other carnal ground, never come to true repentance, which consists in a change of heart and life. Herod was like troubled for John Baptist, but for all that, for his oath’s sake to a wanton wretch, and for the company’s sake, he sent and beheaded him, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/14-9.htm" title="And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.">Matthew 14:9</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/daniel/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the king went to his palace,.... After he had accompanied Daniel to the den, and he was cast into it, the stone was laid to the mouth of it, and that sealed; this was after sunset, for he had laboured till then to serve him, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14</a>, perhaps it was late at night: <p>and passed the night fasting; vexed for what he had done, in signing the decree; fretting because he could not save Daniel, and his heart full of grief for him, and so had no stomach to eat; went to bed without his supper, lay all night fasting, and would not eat a bit nor drink a drop of anything: <p>neither were instruments of music brought before him; as used to be after supper, and played upon; his heart was too full, and his mind and thoughts so intent on Daniel's case, that he could not listen to music, or bear the sound of it. Jarchi interprets it a "table", to sit down at, and eat, being furnished and well served, as was usual; but this is implied in the preceding clause. Aben Ezra, Saadiah, and Jacchiades, explain by songs and musical instruments, harps and psalter and Saadiah adds, girls to sing and dance. De Dieu, from the use of the word in the Arabic language, thinks that incense is meant, which was used at feasts, and in the palaces of princes. <p>And his sleep went from him; while he was up he could take no pleasure in eating and drinking, and hearing music; and when he was in bed, he could not sleep for thinking what he had done, and what was the case of Daniel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/daniel/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/daniel/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">instruments of musick</span>] The meaning of the word thus rendered is unknown. The root in Aram. and Heb. means <span class="ital">to thrust, overthrow</span> (<a href="/psalms/36-12.htm" title="There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.">Psalm 36:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-13.htm" title="You have thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.">Psalm 118:13</a>). In Arab. it means further <span class="ital">to spread, spread out</span>, and is also used specially in the sense <span class="ital">compressit feminam</span>. The ancient translators and commentators conjectured a meaning suited to the context. Theod. (<span class="greekheb">ἐδέσματα</span>), Pesh., Jerome (<span class="ital">cibi</span>), render <span class="ital">food</span>; Rashi (12 cent.), <span class="ital">a table</span> (cf. A.V. <span class="ital">marg.</span>); Ibn Ezra, <span class="ital">stringed instruments</span> (supposing, improbably, <span class="ital">to thrust</span> to be used in the sense of <span class="ital">to strike</span>); Saad. (10 cent.), <span class="ital">dancing-girls</span>; many moderns (from the Arab. meaning of the root, mentioned above), <span class="ital">concubines</span>. But it is very doubtful whether it is legitimate to explain an Aram. word from a sense peculiar to Arabic, and there, moreover, only secondary and derived. By assuming a very small corruption in the text (<span class="greekheb">דחון</span> for <span class="greekheb">לחנן</span>), we should, however, obtain the ordinary Aram. word for <span class="ital">concubines</span> (<a href="/context/daniel/5-2.htm" title="Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein....">Daniel 5:2-3</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-23.htm" title="But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:">Daniel 5:23</a>): so Marti, Prince.

The word <span class="accented">dahvan</span>, translated "instruments of music," is rendered by Furst, "dancing-girl; "Gesenius, "concubine; "Rosenmuller  renders, "odours." The Mediaeval Greek Version translates, "instruments of music." Furst speaks with favour of the Syriac rendering, "food-tables." <span class="accented">Han'ayl</span>, the aphel of '<span class="accented">eilal</span>, has to be noted as a sign of antiquity. The version of the Septuagint is very wide from the Massoretic in the latter part of the verse, "Thus the king returned to his palace, and went to bed fasting, being grieved about Daniel." It is evident that the Septuagint translator had before him <span class="accented">deheel</span> instead of <span class="accented">dohvan</span> - <span class="accented">nun</span> in the script of Egyptian Aramaic is very like <span class="accented">lamed</span> in the later mode writing, as also <span class="accented">yodh</span> and <span class="accented">vav</span>. It is possible that the name "Daniel" was read <span class="accented">han'eel or</span>, <span class="accented">vies versa</span>, as two of the letters are identical If we can accept the Septuagint reading, the difficulty of this mysterious <span class="accented">dahoun</span> disappears. Another clause is added here in the Septuagint from ver. 22 (23) Massoretic, though with variations. "Then the God of Daniel, taking thought for him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) closed the mouths of the lions, that they did not hurt Daniel." This statement is not inserted in Daniel's answer to the king in the Septuagint, as it is in the Massoretic text. It would almost seem that our present text in both cases is a condensation of a more extended document. This view receives support from the rendering of Theodotion, "And the king departed to his house, and went to bed supperless, and viands were not brought to him, and his sleep went from him, and God closed the mouths of the lions, and they did not hurt Daniel." It will be seen that the last clause here agrees with the concluding clause of the Septuagint. The mysterious word <span class="accented">dahvan is</span> rendered here "food" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) - a version that is suspicious from the fact that it merely repeats, under another form, the statement that the king went to bed fasting. It is supported by the Peshitta and the Vulgate. This difference can scarcely be due to a various reading. Otherwise the Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic text. The king's sorrow and humiliation could not be better pictured than it is here: even the feast of the palace had no pleasure for him, he was so grieved about Daniel. But we must also bear in mind that fasting had among the Jews, and, indeed, in the East generally, a relationship to prayer (see <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, where fasting takes the place of prayer; see also <a href="/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). It means also repentance (<a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6-8</a>). Darius, then, repented his hasty decree, and prayed for the deliverance of Daniel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1500;&#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1488; the construction is changed. This passage does not depend on &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, time, namely, to show the interpretation (Hitz.), but is co-ordinate with the foregoing relative clause, and like it is dependent on &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1488;. The change of the construction is caused by the circumstance that in the last passage another subject needed to be introduced: The king should give him time, and Daniel will show the interpretation. The copulative  &#1493;before &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1488; (interpretation) is used neither explicatively, namely, and indeed, nor is it to be taken as meaning also; the simple and is sufficient, although the second part of the request contains the explanation and reason of the first; i.e., Daniel asks for the granting of a space, not that he might live longer, but that he might be able to interpret the dream to the king. Besides, that he merely speaks of the meaning of the dream, and not also of the dream itself, is, as <a href="/daniel/2-25.htm">Daniel 2:25</a>. show, to be here explained (as in <a href="/daniel/2-24.htm">Daniel 2:24</a>) as arising from the brevity of the narrative. For the same reason it is not said that the king granted the quest, but <a href="/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17</a>. immediately shows what Daniel did after the granting of his request. He went into his own house and showed the matter to his companions, that they might entreat God of His mercy for this secret, so that they might not perish along with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</body></html>
