Does not every man's heart direct him, when in want or distress, to call upon God? We could not live a day without God; and can men live thirty days without prayer? Yet it is to be feared that those who, without any decree forbidding them, present no hearty, serious petitions to God for more than thirty days together, are far more numerous than those who serve him continually, with humble, thankful hearts. Persecuting laws are always made on false pretences; but it does not become Christians to make bitter complaints, or to indulge in revilings. It is good to have hours for prayer. Daniel prayed openly and avowedly; and though a man of vast business, he did not think that would excuse him from daily exercises of devotion. How inexcusable are those who have but little to do in the world, yet will not do thus much for their souls! In trying times we must take heed, lest, under pretence of discretion, we are guilty of cowardice in the cause of God. All who throw away their souls, as those certainly do that live without prayer, even if it be to save their lives, at the end will be found to be fools. Nor did Daniel only pray, and not give thanks, cutting off some part of the service to make the time of danger shorter; but he performed the whole. In a word, the duty of prayer is founded upon the sufficiency of God as an almighty Creator and Redeemer, and upon our wants as sinful creatures. To Christ we must turn our eyes. Thither let the Christian look, thither let him pray, in this land of his captivity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/daniel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then these presidents and princes assembled together - Margin, came tumultuously. The margin expresses the proper meaning of the original word - &#1512;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;  ra&#770;gash - to run together with tumult. Why they came together in that manner is not stated. Bertholdt suggests that it means that they came in a procession, or in a body, to the king; but there is undoubtedly the idea of their doing it with haste, or with an appearance of great earnestness or excitement. Perhaps they imagined that they would be more likely to carry the measure if proposed as something that demanded immediate action, or something wherein it appeared that the very safety of the king was involved, than if it were proposed in a sedate and calm manner. If it were suggested in such a way as to seem to admit of deliberation, perhaps the suspicion of the king might be aroused, or he might have asked questions as to the ground of the necessity of such a law, which it might not have been easy to answer.<p>King Darius, live for ever - The usual way of saluting a monarch.

All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not, Wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree</span>. The Septuagint, in regard to those verses, is much briefer, and reveals a better text. "Then those men came and said before the king, We have made a decree and a statute, that any man who offereth prayer or presents petition to any god for the space of thirty days, save only to Darius the king, shall be cast into the den of lions; and thus Darius decreed, and confirmed it." The fact that requests to uther men are not forbidden is to be observed. The long catalogue of officials is omitted; the whole conspiracy is the work of Daniel's co-presidents. Theodotion and the Peshitta are in practical agreement with the Massoretic text. To understand the point of this decree, that seems to us so absurd, and comprehend how any one with sufficient mental vigour left to be placed by Cyrus as governor in Babylon could be led to yield to confirm it, we must recognize the state of matters in Babylon. During the reign of Nabunahid there had been many religious changes. The seclusion of the monarch had led to the neglect of many of the regular rites of the gods of Babil. The policy he pursued of bringing the gods of various provinces to Babylon tended, as did the similar policy in Rome, to draw off from the importance of the national religion by forming rival cults. One of the first acts of Cyrus's reign was to order the replacing of these deities in their ancient shrines. This would necessarily be most distasteful to the worshippers of these imported deities. There would be much murmuring among the huge heterogeneous population; and there would be thus a well-grounded fear of a religious riot. A bold soldier as Gobryas (Darius) was, he probably was but a timid ruler, and nothing would he dread more than a religious riot. Would it not be a plausible way of meeting this difficulty to order for one month all worship to cease? The British Government in India regulates the religion of the inhabitants as summarily, forbidding religious observances that are liable to cause excitement in votaries of rival creeds. Thus Moses assigned, as a reason for refusing to sacrifice in Egypt, the wrath of the  Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/8-26.htm">Exodus 8:26</a>). The offering of a prayer among heathen peoples generally meant the offering of sacrifices, also accompanied possibly by processions. That the decree was made by Darius in the absence of his favourite minister might have two reasons: either from the fact that the word used (<span class="accented">hargishoo</span>) <span class="accented">implies</span> that the presidents rushed in tumultuously into the royal presence; that there was an emergency which must be met by instant action; or that, being a weak man, he did not wish his other counsellors to think that he was so under the influence of this Jew that he could do nothing without first consulting him; so, by way of showing his independence, he signed the decree. As for the practical deification of himself required from the subject <span class="accented">races</span>, that would not appear to him a matter of importance. It might even seem to him as the surest way of doing away with the rancour of religious rivalries to give these conflicting creeds a common object. He, Gobryas, was the representative of Cyrus, in whom deity was incarnate, therefore let them worship him in his representative capacity. That Daniel should be affected by this decree might easily never occur to Gobryas Jewish worship, now that the temple at Jerusalem was in ruins, must have become very much the synagogue worship of the present day. A worship that had neither idols nor sacrifices, neither temple nor altar, would seem to the Babylonians, and for that matter to the Medians and Persians also, as much the same as atheism. Christianity seemed so to the Roman Government. Darius, then, would readily think that Daniel could make no serious objection to this order That Daniel always spoke of a God in heaven did not matter much, since, to all appearance, he never worshipped him. Some have maintained that the punishment was an impossible one. It is certain that Asshur-bani-pal inflicted a similar punishment on Saulmugina, a rebel King of Babylon, and did it in honour of the gods. The main objection has been urged from the mistaken assumption that the text implies that the lions' den was a bottle shaped dungeon. There is nothing in the narrative that necessitates this. In regard to the decree, there is reference to the "laws of the Medea and Persians," "the Medea" being placed first. It has been attributed to court flattery, as Darius was a Merle; probably, however, there may be another explanation. The small canton of Ansan, over which Cyrus was king, lay between Elam and Media, but belonged more to the former than to the latter of these countries. Both countries bad been overrun by a nomadic race, the Manda, under Astyages, who had overthrown Cyaxarcs the King of Media. Against Astyages Cyrus rebelled, and gathered to him the Medea, Elamites, and other cognate races. Dr. Winckler thinks that, on his victory over Astyages, Cyrus assumed the name Persian, <span class="accented">Parsu</span>, from his race. The name <span class="accented">Parsua</span> appears in connection with the Medea in an inscription of Shalmaneser, where it seems to indicate a small kingdom occupying much the <span class="accented">same</span> geographical posit;on as Ansan. By taking this old name, not impossibly Cyrus avoided making the Medea feel themselves subject to the Elamites, or the Elamites to the Medea, or either to the little kingdom of Ansan. The Median had comparatively recently been an imperial power, therefore its laws and constitution would be placed before the more recently prominent Persian. One thing that must be observed is that, while the writer of Daniel mentions Medea separate from Persians, he mentions them conjointly. Had the writer been under the delusion attributed to him by all critical interpreters, that the Median Empire came between the Babylonian and the Persian, he would not have represented the Median courtiers as saying anything about the Persians or their laws; the Medes, and the Medea alone, would be considered. According to the Greek account, from which it is alleged Daniel drew his information, Persia was a small, undeveloped country before Cyrus raised it to empire. What right, then, would it have to have its laws mentioned in the same breath with those of imperial Media? If, however, Cyrus had been raised to such power, so as to be able to encounter successfully Astyages and his Scythian hordes by the adhesion to his cause of the Medea, the laws of the Medea might well get a preference, as the Medea were, in all probability, more numerous than the Persians, though the laws of the Persians would be mentioned. The claim that these laws were immutable must be regarded as on a par with several other Eastern exaggerations. <span class="accented">Signed the writing and the decree.</span> The reading of the Septuagint seems superior, "And <span class="accented">so</span> King Darius decreed (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>), and confirmed it." At the same time, the verb <span class="accented">resham</span>, translated "<span class="accented">sign</span>," really means "<span class="accented">engrave</span>," and therefore might naturally enough be used for affixing a seal to a clay tablet; only <span class="accented">hetham</span> is the word usually used for "sealing" a document. Behrmann thinks it does not refer to the signature of the sovereign, but  to the engraving the decree on the clay. If we imagine <span class="accented">yeqeem</span> to have fallen out before "<span class="accented">sara</span>, we have a reading not unlike the LXX. In the seventh verse there is a list of officials omitted from the Septuagint; it is almost identical in members with that which we find in ch. 3, but in a slightly different order, only the <span class="accented">sareqeen are</span> added and the <span class="accented">edargazereen</span> omitted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/daniel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The meaning of the king's answer shapes itself differently according to the different explanations given of the words  &#1488;&#1494;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488; &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;. The word &#1488;&#1494;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488; drow eh, which occurs only again in the same phrase in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-8.htm">Daniel 2:8</a>, is regarded, in accordance with the translations of Theodot., &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787;&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;, and of the Vulg., "sermo recessit a me," as a verb, and as of like meaning with &#1506;&#1494;&#1500;, "to go away or depart," and is therefore rendered by M. Geier, Berth., and others in the sense, "the dream has escaped from me;" but Ges. Hv., and many older interpreters translate it, on the contrary, "the command is gone out from me." But without taking into account that the punctuation of the word &#1488;&#1494;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488; is not at all that of a verb, for this form can neither be a particip. nor the 3rd pers. pret. fem., no acknowledgment of the dream's having escaped from him is made; for such a statement would contradict what was said at <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>, and would not altogether agree with the statement of <a href="/daniel/2-8.htm">Daniel 2:8</a>. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; is not the dream. Besides, the supposition that &#1488;&#1494;&#1491; is equivalent to &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, to go away, depart, is not tenable. The change of the  &#1500;into  &#1491;is extremely rare in the Semitic, and is not to be assumed in the word &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, since Daniel himself uses &#1488;&#1494;&#1500; &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-24.htm">Daniel 2:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19-20</a>, and also Ezra; <a href="/ezra/4-23.htm">Ezra 4:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8</a>, <a href="/ezra/5-15.htm">Ezra 5:15</a>. Moreover &#1488;&#1494;&#1500; has not the meaning of &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, to go out, to take one's departure, but corresponds with the Hebr. &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; .rbe, to go. Therefore Winer, Hengst., Ibn Esr. Aben Ezra, Saad., and other rabbis interpret the word as meaning firmus: "the word stands firm;" cf. <a href="/daniel/6-13.htm">Daniel 6:13</a> (12), &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488; &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; ("the thing is true"). This interpretation is justified by the actual import of the words, as it also agrees with <a href="/daniel/2-8.htm">Daniel 2:8</a>; but it does not accord with <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a>. Here (in <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a>) the declaration of the certainty of the king's word was superfluous, because all the royal commands were unchangeable. For this reason also the meaning &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, studiously, earnestly, as Hitz., by a fanciful reference to the Persian, whence he has derived it, has explained it, is to be rejected. Much more satisfactory is the derivation from the Old Persian word found on inscriptions, a&#770;zanda, "science," "that which is known," given by Delitzsch (Herz.'s Realenc. iii. p. 274), and adopted by Kran. and Klief.<p>(Note: In regard to the explanation of the word &#1488;&#1494;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488; as given above, it is, however, to be remarked that it is not confirmed, and Delitzsch has for the present given it up, because-as he has informed me-the word azda&#770;, which appears once in the large inscription of Behistan (Bisutun) and twice in the inscription of Nakhschi-Rustam, is of uncertain reading and meaning. Spiegel explains it "unknown," from zan, to know, and a privativum.)<p>Accordingly Klief. thus interprets the phrase: "let the word from me be known," "be it known to you;" which is more suitable obviously than that of Kran.: "the command is, so far as regards me, made public." For the king now for the first time distinctly and definitely says that he wishes not only to hear from the wise men the interpretation, but also the dream itself, and declares the punishment that shall visit them in the event of their not being able to comply. &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, 2 Macc. 1:16, lxx in <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-39.htm">Daniel 3:39</a>, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to cut in pieces, a punishment that was common among the Babylonians (<a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/3-39.htm">Daniel 3:39</a>, cf. <a href="/ezekiel/16-40.htm">Ezekiel 16:40</a>), and also among the Israelites in the case of prisoners of war (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>). It is not, however, to be confounded with the barbarous custom which was common among the Persians, of mangling particular limbs. &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;, in <a href="/ezra/6-11.htm">Ezra 6:11</a> &#1504;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, dunghill, sink. The changing of their houses into dunghills is not to be regarded as meaning that the house built of clay would be torn down, and then dissolved by the rain and storm into a heap of mud, but is to be interpreted according to <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>, where the temple of Baal is spoken of as having been broken down and converted into private closets; cf. Hv. in loco.

As to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, it is to be remarked that Daniel uses only the suffix forms &#1499;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, while with Ezra &#1499;&#1501; and &#1499;&#1503; are interchanged (see above, p. 515), which are found in the language of the Targums and might be regarded as Hebraisms, while the forms &#1499;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; are peculiar to the Syriac and the Samaritan dialects. This distinction does not prove that the Aramaic of Daniel belongs to a period later than that of Ezra (Hitz., v. Leng.), but only that Daniel preserves more faithfully the familiar Babylonian form of the Aramaic than does the Jewish scribe Ezra.</body></html>
