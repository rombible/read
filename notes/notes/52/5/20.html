<a href="/1_corinthians/14-39.htm" title="Why, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.">1Corinthians 14:39</a>), which was an inspired and inspiring preaching, The despondency of the Thessalonians led them not only to quench the fervour of the Holy Ghost in their own bosoms, but to turn a cold and disparaging ear to the sanguine “prophets” who preached to them, the effect of which insensibility was to “quench the Spirit” by degrees in the prophets also. It is because of this double effect of gloominess, inward upon themselves, and outward upon others, that the command, “Quench not,” occurs between the exhortation to thanksgiving and the warning not to despise prophecy. This seems to be the most natural way of accounting for the present warning, but there are two other main interpretations:—(1) It is said that what tempted the Thessalonians to disparage prophecy was their fascination for the more showy gift of tongues. It is true that such was the case at Corinth, and not unnaturally so; and at first sight it seems as if, in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1Corinthians 14:1</a>, “spiritual gifts” were contrasted with “prophecy” as two separate classes, thus giving some ground for Bishop Words-worth’s interpretation of our present passage—viz., that <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1Thessalonians 5:19</a> refers to the gifts of tongues, miracles, &c., in something of the same contrast with “prophecy” in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm" title="Despise not prophesyings.">1Thessalonians 5:20</a> as may be found in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-39.htm" title="Why, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.">1Corinthians 14:39</a>. But, on the other hand, it seems more likely that in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1Corinthians 14:1</a> prophecy is not contrasted with the spiritual gifts there specified as a separate class, but selected <span class= "ital">from among</span> them: “It is all very well to covet spiritual gifts as a whole, but it would be better to aim more particularly at that one—prophecy—which is the greatest:” just so here, “Do not quench the Spirit, in whatever direction it may blaze up; but especially do not disparage preaching.” Besides, there is nothing to prove that the Thessalonians were dazzled by the more brilliant gifts: and it accords better with the context to suppose that the fault to be corrected in them was not a light sensationalism, but a tendency to damp all ardour alike. (2) Others suppose that the Thessalonians had had experience of persons who had <span class= "ital">abused</span> the gift of prophecy, and therefore were disposed to suspect and dislike prophecy altogether. This view gains support from <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2Thessalonians 2:2</a>, and also from the command in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1Thessalonians 5:21</a> to test, and retain only what stood the test. There is no particular ground for contradicting this view; but it is unnecessary, and does not carry on the thought so connectedly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm" title="Despise not prophesyings....">1 Thessalonians 5:20-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">Despise not prophesyings </span>— That is, the preaching of God’s word; for the apostle is not here speaking of extraordinary gifts, but of such as are ordinary. It seems one means of grace is put for all; and whoever despises or makes light of any of these, much more that <span class="ital">sets </span>them <span class="ital">at naught, </span>as the original expression, <span class="greekheb">εξουθενειτε</span>, properly signifies, under whatever pretence, will surely, though perhaps gradually and insensibly, quench the Spirit. Some neglect attending the ministry of God’s word, on pretence that they are so well instructed that they can receive little or no benefit from it. But let such consider that the spiritual life is maintained and increased in the soul, not so much by receiving new discoveries in divine knowledge, “as by the recollection of matters formerly known, and by serious meditation thereon.” Persuaded, therefore, that a regular attendance on the ministry of the word will greatly tend to cherish the influences of the Spirit, and a neglect thereof will proportionably obstruct them; listen with attention and reverence to the ministers of Christ, while they interpret and apply to men’s consciences the Holy Scriptures, or speak to them by way of instruction, warning, reproof, exhortation, or comfort: and own the authority of God as speaking in and by his appointed messengers. Meantime <span class="ital">prove all things </span>— Which any preacher teaches, enjoins, or recommends; try every doctrine, precept, advice, or exhortation, by the touchstone of Scripture; <span class="ital">and hold fast that which is good </span>— Zealously, resolutely, and diligently practise it, in spite of all opposition. “What a glorious freedom of thought,” says an eminent divine, “do the apostles recommend! And how contemptible, in their account, is a blind and implicit faith! May all Christians use this liberty of judging for themselves in matters of religion, and allow it to one another, and to all mankind!” It must be observed, however, that those who <span class="ital">heap up for themselves teachers, having itching ears, </span>under pretence of <span class="ital">proving all things, </span>have no countenance or excuse from this text. <span class="ital">And </span>be equally zealous and careful to <span class="ital">abstain from all appearance of evil </span>— From every disposition, word, and action, which you judge or suspect to be sinful; or which you have reason to fear might prove to you an occasion of sin. Nay, in some, yea, in many cases, abstain from those things which appear to others to be evil, or the lawfulness of which they question, though you do not. For it is better to avoid such things, than by an uncharitable use of your Christian liberty to cause your weak brother to stumble, or to prejudice others against the truth.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:16-22 We are to rejoice in creature-comforts, as if we rejoiced not, and must not expect to live many years, and rejoice in them all; but if we do rejoice in God, we may do that evermore. A truly religious life is a life of constant joy. And we should rejoice more, if we prayed more. Prayer will help forward all lawful business, and every good work. If we pray without ceasing, we shall not want matter for thanksgiving in every thing. We shall see cause to give thanks for sparing and preventing, for common and uncommon, past and present, temporal and spiritual mercies. Not only for prosperous and pleasing, but also for afflicting providences, for chastisements and corrections; for God designs all for our good, though we at present see not how they tend to it. Quench not the Spirit. Christians are said to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire. He worketh as fire, by enlightening, enlivening, and purifying the souls of men. As fire is put out by taking away fuel, and as it is quenched by pouring water, or putting a great deal of earth upon it; so we must be careful not to quench the Holy Spirit, by indulging carnal lusts and affections, minding only earthly things. Believers often hinder their growth in grace, by not giving themselves up to the spiritual affections raised in their hearts by the Holy Spirit. By prophesyings, here understand the preaching of the word, the interpreting and applying the Scriptures. We must not despise preaching, though it is plain, and we are told no more than what we knew before. We must search the Scriptures. And proving all things must be to hold fast that which is good. We should abstain from sin, and whatever looks like sin, leads to it, and borders upon it. He who is not shy of the appearances of sin, who shuns not the occasions of it, and who avoids not the temptations and approaches to it, will not long keep from doing sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Despise not prophesyings - On the subject of prophesyings in the early Christian church, see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a> ff1 ff. The reference here seems to be to preaching. They were not to undervalue it in comparison with other things. It is possible that in Thessalonica, as appears to have been the case subsequently in Corinth (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>), there were those who regarded the power of working miracles, or of speaking in unknown tongues, as a much more eminent endowment than that of stating the truths of religion in language easily understood. It would not be unnatural that comparisons should be made between these two classes of endowments, much to the disadvantage of the latter; and hence may have arisen this solemn caution not to disregard or despise the ability to make known divine truth in intelligible language. A similar counsel may not be inapplicable to us now. The office of setting forth the truth of God is to be the permanent office in the church; that of speaking foreign languages by miraculous endowment, was to be temporary. But the office of addressing mankind on the great duties of religion, and of publishing salvation, is to be God's great ordinance for converting the world. It should not be despised, and no man commends his own wisdom who contemns it - for:<p>(1) it is God's appointment - the means which he has designated for saving people.<p>(2) it has too much to entitle it to respect to make it proper to despise or contemn it. There is nothing else that has so much power over mankind as the preaching of the gospel; there is no other institution of heaven or earth among people that is destined to exert so wide and permanent an influence as the Christian ministry.<p>(3) it is an influence which is wholly good. No man is made the poorer, or the less respectable, or more miserable in life or in death, by following the counsels of a minister of Christ when he makes known the gospel.<p>(4) he who despises it contemns that which is designed to promote his own welfare, and which is indispensable for his salvation. It remains yet to be shown that any man has promoted his own happiness, or the welfare of his family, by affecting to treat with contempt the instructions of the Christian ministry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. prophesyings&#8212;whether exercised in inspired teaching, or in predicting the future.

Yea, the prophecies of private men, such as Agabus, and others, in the apostle's time, and in later ages, are not to be slighted; though instances of this kind are rare in our times, and things of this nature should not be precipitantly, and without care, given into: but rather prophesyings here intend the explanation of Scripture, and the preaching of the word, and particularly by persons who had not the gift of tongues, and therefore men were apt to despise them; see <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>.

The prophet received the truth into his own spirit which was withdrawn from earthly things and concentrated upon the spiritual world. His higher, spiritual part (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), and his moral intelligence (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;), and his speech (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) worked in harmony. His spirit received a spiritual truth in symbol: his understanding interpreted it in its application to actual events, and his speech uttered the interpretation. He was not ecstatically rapt out of the sphere of human intelligence, although his understanding was intensified and clarified by the phenomenal action of the Spirit upon it. This double action imparted a peculiarly elevated character to his speech. The prophetic influence was thus distinguished from the mystical ecstasy, the ecstasy of Paul when rapt into the third heaven, which affected the subject alone and was incommunicable (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-4</a>). The gift of tongues carried the subject out of the prophetic condition in which spirit, understanding, and speech operated in concert, and into a condition in which the understanding was overpowered by the communication to the spirit, so that the spirit could not find its natural expression in rational speech, or speech begotten of the understanding, and found supernatural expression in a tongue created by the Spirit. Paul attached great value to prophecy. He places prophets next after apostles in the list of those whom God has set in the Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>). He associates apostles and prophets as the foundation of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). He assigns to prophecy the precedence among spiritual gifts (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1-5</a>), and urges his readers to desire the gift (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-39.htm">1 Corinthians 14:39</a>). Hence his exhortation here. </body></html>
