It is their duty not only to give good counsel, but also to warn the flock of dangers, and reprove for whatever may be amiss. The people should honour and love their ministers, because their business is the welfare of men's souls. And the people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can to guard against any differences. But love of peace must not make us wink at sin. The fearful and sorrowful spirits, should be encouraged, and a kind word may do much good. We must bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and keep down anger, and this to all men. Whatever man do to us, we must do good to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now we exhort you, brethren - Margin, "beseech." This earnest entreaty is evidently addressed to the whole church, and not to the ministers of the gospel only. The duties here enjoined are such as pertain to all Christians in their appropriate spheres, and should not be left to be performed by ministers only.<p>Warn them - The same word which in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a> is rendered "admonish." It is the duty of every church member, as well as of the ministers of the gospel, affectionately to admonish those whom they know to be living contrary to the requirements of the gospel. One reason why there is so little piety in the church, and why so many professors of religion go astray, is, that the great mass of church members feel no responsibility on this subject. They suppose that it is the duty only of the officers of the church to admonish an erring brother, and hence many become careless and cold and worldly, and no one utters a kind word to them to recall them to a holy walk with God.<p>That are unruly - Margin, "disorderly." The word here used (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ataktos), is one which properly means "not keeping the ranks," as of soldiers; and then irregular, confused, neglectful of duty, disorderly. The reference here is to the members of the church who were irregular in their Christian walk. It is not difficult, in an army, when soldiers get out of the line, or leave their places in the ranks, or are thrown into confusion, to see that little can be accomplished in such a state of irregularity and confusion. As little difficult is it, when the members of a church are out of their places, to see that little can be accomplished in such a state. Many a church is like an army where half the soldiers are out of the line; where there is entire insubordination in the ranks, and where not half of them could be depended on for efficient service in a campaign. Indeed, an army would accomplish little if as large a proportion of it were irregular, idle, remiss, or pursuing their own aims to the neglect of the public interest, as there are members of the church who can never be depended on in accomplishing the great purpose for which it was organized.<p>Comfort the feeble-minded - The dispirited; the disheartened; the downcast. To do this is also the duty of each church member. There are almost always those who are in this condition, and it is not easy to appreciate the value of a kind word to one in that state. Christians are assailed by temptation; in making efforts to do good they are opposed and become disheartened; in their contests with their spiritual foes they are almost overcome; they walk through shades of spiritual night, and find no comfort. In such circumstances, how consoling is the voice of a friend! How comforting is it to feel that they are not alone! How supporting to be addressed by one who has had the same conflicts, and has triumphed! Every Christian - especially every one who has been long in the service of his Master - has a fund of experience which is the property of the church, and which may be of incalculable value to those who are struggling now amidst many embarrassments along the Christian way. He who has that experience should help a weak and sinking brother; he should make his own experience of the efficacy of religion in his trials and conflicts, the means of sustaining others in their struggles. There is no one who would not reach out his hand to save a child borne down rapid stream; yet how often do experienced and strong men in the Christian faith pass by those who are struggling in the "deep waters, where the proud waves have come over their souls!"<p>Support the weak - See the notes at <a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>.<p>Be patient toward all men - See the Greek word here used, explained in the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; compare <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. brethren&#8212;This exhortation to "warm (Greek, 'admonish,' as in 1Th 5:12) the unruly (those 'disorderly' persons, 2Th 3:6, 11, who would not work, and yet expected to be maintained, literally, said of soldiers who will not remain in their ranks, compare 1Th 4:11; also those insubordinate as to Church discipline, in relation to those 'over' the Church, 1Th 5:12), comfort the feeble-minded (the faint-hearted, who are ready to sink 'without hope' in afflictions, 1Th 4:13, and temptations)," applies to all clergy and laity alike, though primarily the duty of the clergy (who are meant in 1Th 5:12)."<p>support&#8212;literally, "lay fast hold on so as to support."<p>the weak&#8212;spiritually.

But others more truly judge he continues his discourse to the whole church, and the several members of it. The same duties are to be performed by both, though under a different obligation: as in the civil state all are to seek the good of the commonwealth, though the magistrates and the governors are more specially obliged by office. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Warn them that are unruly; </span> or admonish, as the same word is rendered in the former verse, here meant of brotherly, there of ministerial, admonition; wherein great prudence is to be used, as to time, place, persons, manner: and the <span class="ital">unruly</span> are such as keep not their place, alluding to soldiers that keep not their rank and station, and they are called in the margin <span class="ital">disorderly, </span> and that: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

In spiritual respects, when men neglect or transgress the rules and order of their walking in their church state, either with respect to their teachers or one another.

The Church at large must second its presiding eiders in such admonishing. In every well-ordered community, whether church or school or nation, needful discipline claims the support of public opinion. The disorder that required this general censure was doubtless that hinted at in ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a> (see note), and which had grown more pronounced when St Paul wrote <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time....">2 Thessalonians 2:6-15</a>; it was a common injury and discredit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The unruly</span>: better, <span class="bld">the disorderly</span> (R.

The mourners whom St Paul consoled in ch. <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope....">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>, would be amongst “the fainthearted” at Thessalonica.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be patient toward all</span> men] <span class="bld">longsuffering toward all</span> (R.
