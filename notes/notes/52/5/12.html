These details show us still further the mixture of restless ungoverned zeal with gloomy forebodings and discontents.<p><span class= "bld">To know them which labour.</span>—A command to enter into the spirit of ecclesiastical discipline. The persons meant are not simply the hard-working laity, contrasted with the idlers of <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;">1Thessalonians 4:11</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.">2Thessalonians 3:11</a>, but those who performed the laborious office of the priesthood, as the words subsequent show. And “knowing” them is hardly to be limited either to the sense of “recognising their position,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“not ignoring them,” or, on the other hand, to the sense of “being on terms of familiar intercourse with them.” The Greek word indicates <span class= "ital">appreciation;</span> they are bidden to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the presbyter and his work, and to endeavour to understand his teaching, and to value his example. The logical connection of this verse with the preceding is that of course the main endeavours to “edify” the brethren were made by the presbytery; and the command to edify involves the command to accept edification.<p><span class= "bld">Are over you in the Lord.</span>—This is the primitive idea of the priest in the Church: he is not a member of a sacerdotal caste, ministering to an outer world, but a <span class= "ital">superior officer</span> in a spiritual society consisting of nothing but priests (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>, where the right reading is, “Made us a kingdom of priests”). It is specially interesting to notice how much <span class= "ital">power</span> is given to the presbytery in this earliest writing of the New Testament, and how carefully St. Paul seems to have organised his churches, and that at the very foundation of them. It is only “in the Lord” that the presbytery are over men, that is, in spiritual matters.<p><span class= "bld">Admonish you.</span>—The presbytery are not only organisers, managers of the corporate affairs of their Church, but also spiritual guides to give practical advice to individual Christians.

It is their duty not only to give good counsel, but also to warn the flock of dangers, and reprove for whatever may be amiss. The people should honour and love their ministers, because their business is the welfare of men's souls. And the people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can to guard against any differences. But love of peace must not make us wink at sin. The fearful and sorrowful spirits, should be encouraged, and a kind word may do much good. We must bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and keep down anger, and this to all men.

It is evident, however, that the church was not left without appointed persons to minister to it when its founders should be away. We know that there were presbyters ordained over the church at Ephesus, and over the churches in Crete (<a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>; Titus i. 5), and that there were bishops and deacons at Philippi <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, and there is every reason to believe that similar officers would be appointed in every newly organized church, The word "know" seems to mean that they were not to make themselves strangers to them - to be cold and distant toward them - to be ignorant of their needs, or to be indifferent to them. While a people are not obtrusively to intermeddle with the business of a minister, anymore than they are with that of any other man, yet there are things in regard to him with which they should be acquainted. They should seek to be personally acquainted with him, and make him their confidant and counselor in their spiritual troubles. They should seek his friendship, and endeavor to maintain all proper contact with him. They should not regard him as a distant man, or as a stranger among them. They should so far understand his circumstances as to know what is requisite to make him comfortable, and should be on such terms that they may readily and cheerfully furnish what he needs. And they are to "know" or regard him as their spiritual teacher and ruler; not to be strangers to the place where he preaches the word of life, and not to listen to his admonitions and reproofs as those of a stranger, but as those of a pastor and friend.<p>Which labour among you - There is no reason to suppose, as many have done, that the apostle here refers to different classes of ministers. He rather refers to different parts of the work which the same ministers perform. The first is, that they "labor" - that is, evidently, in preaching the gospel. For the use of the word, see <a href="//biblehub.com/john/4-38.htm">John 4:38</a>, where it occurs twice; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-16.htm">1 Corinthians 16:16</a>. The word is one which properly expresses wearisome toil, and implies that the office of preaching is one that demands constant industry.<p>And are over you in the Lord - That is, by the appointment of the Lord, or under his direction. They are not absolute sovereigns, but are themselves subject to one who is over them - the Lord Jesus. On the word here rendered "are over you" (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#836;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  proistamenous) see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>, where it is translated "ruleth."<p>And admonish you - The word here used (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  noutheteo&#772;) is rendered "admonish," and "admonished," in <a href="/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>; and warn, and warning, <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, to put in mind; and then to warn, entreat, exhort. It is a part of the duty of a minister to put his people in mind of the truth; to warn them of danger; to exhort them to perform their duty; to admonish them if they go astray. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. beseech&#8212;"Exhort" is the expression in 1Th 5:14; here, "we beseech you," as if it were a personal favor (Paul making the cause of the Thessalonian presbyters, as it were, his own).<p>know&#8212;to have a regard and respect for. Recognize their office, and treat them accordingly (compare 1Co 16:18) with reverence and with liberality in supplying their needs (1Ti 5:17). The Thessalonian Church having been newly planted, the ministers were necessarily novices (1Ti 3:6), which may have been in part the cause of the people's treating them with less respect. Paul's practice seems to have been to ordain elders in every Church soon after its establishment (Ac 14:23).<p>them which labour &#8230; are over &#8230; admonish you&#8212;not three classes of ministers, but one, as there is but one article common to the three in the Greek. "Labor" expresses their laborious life; "are over you," their pre-eminence as presidents or superintendents ("bishops," that is, overseers, Php 1:1, "them that have rule over you," literally, leaders, Heb 13:17; "pastors," literally, shepherds, Eph 4:11); "admonish you," one of their leading functions; the Greek is "put in mind," implying not arbitrary authority, but gentle, though faithful, admonition (2Ti 2:14, 24, 25; 1Pe 5:3).<p>in the Lord&#8212;Their presidency over you is in divine things; not in worldly affairs, but in things appertaining to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 12,13. The apostle spake before of their private duties as Christians to one another, now of their duties to their pastors and teachers, lest by what he had said they might think the ministry needless. It seems this church was settled under officers, which is called an organical church. And though the apostle himself was driven from them by persecution, yet they were not without ministers and teachers; and they owed a great duty to them, to which he doth lovingly exhort them. And he describes them not by the name of their office, as pastors, elders, or ministers, but by the work of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Them which labour among you; </span> the word imports diligent labour, causing weariness, as <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1 Timothy 5:17</a></span>, <span class="ital">who labour in the word and doctrine; </span> which shows both the nature of the work of the ministry, it is laborious; and the duty of ministers therein, not to seek the honour and profit of the office, and refuse the labour of it; they have the work of teaching, and of oversight or government, and admonition, and all require labour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And are over you in the Lord:</span> the same word is used <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1 Timothy 5:17</a></span>, and translated <span class="ital">rule; </span> it signifies that superintendency and precedency, which the elders or ministers have over their respective flocks; and it is said to be <span class="ital">in the Lord, </span> either to distinguish them from civil officers, or to show both the original, rule, and end of their office; it is from the Lord by institution, and to be managed according to his laws, and directed to his service and glory as its end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And admonish you:</span> the word is often used in the New Testament, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a> <a href="/romans/15-14.htm" title="And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.">Romans 15:14</a> <a href="/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a> 3:16</span>; and signifies either the putting into the mind by way of instruction, or upon the mind by way of counsel, threatening, or reproof; and that either publicly or privately. Now the duty they owed to them is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">To know them, </span> as in the former words; that is, to own them in their office, to have regard to their teaching, and to submit to their government, and to reward their labours; as knowing is often taken in Scripture to express the acts of the will and affection, and the actions also of the outward man, as well as of the mind; as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/1-6.htm" title="For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.">Psalm 1:6</a> 101:4</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. <span class="ital">To esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake; </span> uperekperissou see <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound.

The words in the Greek carry such an emphasis as cannot well be expressed in English, importing esteem and love to an hyperbole; their love was to be joined with esteem, and esteem with love, and both these to abound and superabound towards them. We read of a <span class="ital">double honour, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1 Timothy 5:17</a></span>, which contains the whole duty of people to their ministers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For their work’s sake; </span> whether of teaching, ruling, or admonition. Their work is in itself honourable, and work that tends to your salvation, and though their persons be meant, yet to esteem and love them for their work; or if upon any other account they deserve it of you, yet their work is to be the chief reason thereof; especially considering that their work more immediately respected them of this church rather than any others; and their labour was amongst them; or, as some read it, in you, to instruct, edify, and comfort your inward man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And be at peace among yourselves; </span> some copies read it, with them, autoiv for eautoiv, by a little alteration of the Greek word; and then it still refers to their teachers, they should be at peace, or live in peace, with them; for oftentimes dissensions arise between ministers and people, whereby their edification is hindered. But I rather follow our own translation; and so it is a new duty of the people towards one another, to preserve mutual peace among themselves, and yet these words may respect the former. For if the people give honour and respect to their ministers, it may be a means to preserve peace among themselves: among the Corinthians, the applauding of some of their teachers, and the contempt of others, made great schisms and divisions amongst them.

Not in a natural or civil, but spiritual relation; and what follows relating to the ministers of the word, the apostle addresses this church on their behalf, not in an imperious and authoritative manner, but by way of entreaty, with great humility and strong affection: <p>know them that labour among you; who were not non-residents, but were upon the spot with them; and where indeed should pastors be, but with their flocks? and husbandmen and vinedressers, but in their fields and vineyards? and stewards, but in the families where they are placed? and parents, but with their children? nor were they loiterers in the vineyard, or slothful servants, and idle shepherds, but labourers; who laboured in the word and doctrine; gave up themselves to meditation, reading, and prayer; laboured hard in private, to find out the meaning of the word of God; and studied to show themselves workmen, that need not be ashamed; and preached the word in season and out of season; faithfully dispensed all ordinances, and diligently performed the duties of their office; and were willing to spend and be spent, for the glory of Christ, and the good of souls, and earnestly contended for the faith of the Gospel; and all this they did, as among them, so for them, for their spiritual good and welfare: some render the words, "in you"; they laboured in teaching, instructing, and admonishing them; they laboured to enlighten their understandings, to inform their judgments, to raise their affections, and to bring their wills to a resignation to the will of God; to refresh their memories with Gospel truths; to strengthen their faith, encourage their hope, and draw out their love to God and Christ, and the brethren: and what the apostle directs them to, as their duty towards these persons, is to "know" them; that is, not to learn their names, and know their persons, who they were; for they could not but know them in this sense, since they dwelt and laboured among them, and were continually employed in instructing them; but that they would make themselves known to them, and converse freely and familiarly with them, that so they might know the state of their souls, and be better able to speak a word in season to them; and that they would take notice of them, show respect to them, and an affection for them; acknowledge them as their pastors, and account of them as stewards of the mysteries of God, and own them as ministers of Christ; and reckon them as blessings to them, and acknowledge the same with thankfulness; and obey them, and submit unto them in the ministry of the word and ordinances, and to their counsel and advice, so far as is agreeable to the word of God: the Arabic version renders it, "that ye may know the dignity of them that labour among you"; and so conduct and behave towards them accordingly: <p>and are over you in the Lord; are set in the highest place in the church, and bear the highest office there; have the presidency and government in it, and go before the saints, and guide and direct them in matters both of doctrine and practice, being ensamples to the flock; the Syriac version renders it, "and stand before you"; ministering unto you in holy things, being servants to you for Jesus' sake: and this "in the Lord"; or by the Lord; for they did not take this honour to themselves, nor were they appointed by men, but they were made able ministers of the word by God; received their gifts qualifying them for this work from Christ, and were placed as overseers of the church by the Holy Ghost: and it was only in things pertaining to the Lord that they were over them; not in things civil, which distinguishes them from civil magistrates; nor in things secular and worldly, they had nothing to do in their families, to preside there, or with their worldly concerns, only in the church of Christ, and in things pertaining to their spiritual welfare; and though they were over them, yet under Christ, and in subjection to him, as their Lord and King; governing not in an arbitrary and tyrannical way, lording it over God's heritage, usurping a dominion over the faith of men, coining new doctrines, and making new laws;

But there is nothing in the grammar of the sentence, nor in the nature of the duties specified, which would warrant us in distributing these functions amongst <span class="ital">distinct orders</span> of Church office. “Labouring,” “presiding,” and “admonishing” form the threefold calling of the local Christian ministry. Doubtless St Paul had organized this Church before leaving it, as he and Barnabas did the Churches of Lycaonia at an earlier time, “ordaining elders in every city” (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm" title="And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.">Acts 14:23</a>). It is not likely that it had advanced beyond the incipient stage of Church government. The Epistle to the Philippians, in which “bishops and deacons” are addressed (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Php 1:1</a>), was written nearly ten years later.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Labour”—or <span class="bld">toil</span>, as in ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a> (see note)—implies <span class="ital">difficulty</span> in the work; the Apostle uses it of his own spiritual work in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-11.htm" title="I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain.">Galatians 4:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Php 2:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-29.htm" title=" Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.">Colossians 1:29</a>. The chief instrument and method of this “labour” are pointed out in <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; “who labour in word and doctrine.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lit., <span class="bld">and preside over you in the Lord</span>. The Pastoral Epistles, describing Church office in its more advanced development, represent this as the chief duty of <span class="ital">the elders</span>: “Let the elders who preside (<span class="ital">rule</span>, A.V. and R. V.) well, be counted worthy of double honour”; comp. also <a href="/1_timothy/3-5.htm" title="(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)">1 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.">1 Timothy 3:12</a>. There, however, as here, “labouring” is honoured even more than “ruling.” The presidency of the elders in the Church assemblies naturally carried with it, as in Jewish communities, the right of exercising discipline over the moral life of the community. Hence “preside” comes to signify “rule,” as also in <a href="/romans/12-8.htm" title="Or he that exhorts, on exhortation: he that gives, let him do it with simplicity; he that rules, with diligence; he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness.">Romans 12:8</a>.

Ministers are often told that they must <span class="ital">know</span> their people: the Apostle points out the duty that exists on the other side. Such knowledge, wanting apparently in some of the Thessalonians, would result in high esteem:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Section VII. Rules for the Sanctified Life.

He there enforced on the Thessalonian believers the virtues which they needed to cultivate, in the light of their <span class="ital">consecration to God</span>. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit served as the sovereign motive for the leading of a pure life (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness....">1 Thessalonians 4:7-8</a>). The same thought runs through this Section. The string of sententious exhortations it contains, find their goal and their uniting principle in the prayer, “May the God of peace Himself sanctify you fully” (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" title="And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>).
