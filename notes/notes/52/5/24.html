And as we must fall, if God did not carry on his good work in the soul, we should pray to God to perfect his work, till we are presented faultless before the throne of his glory. We should pray for one another; and brethren should thus express brotherly love. This epistle was to be read to all the brethren. Not only are the common people allowed to read the Scriptures, but it is their duty, and what they should be persuaded to do. The word of God should not be kept in an unknown tongue, but transplanted, that as all men are concerned to know the Scriptures, so they all may be able to read them. The Scriptures should be read in all public congregations, for the benefit of the unlearned especially. We need no more to make us happy, than to know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

What need he then have prayed? Because God’s decrees and promises, though immutable and infallible, yet are to be accomplished in a way of prayer. Prayer is our duty, and God’s decrees and promises are no dispensation from our duty: besides, duties are more known to us than God’s decrees; and God decree the means as well as the end. But what is it he saith God will do? It is not here expressed, and the word <span class="ital">it</span> is not in the original, but only God <span class="ital">will do, </span> God will effect. He had prayed God would sanctify them wholly, and preserve them blameless, &c.; and this he would do or effect. And he grounds his confidence partly upon God’s calling them. For the apostle knew that God’s <span class="ital">gifts and calling are without repentance; and whom he called, them he justified, and glorified, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a> 11:29</span>. And this the apostle saw in these Thessalonians, by that efficacy of the gospel upon their hearts, that they were effectually called and chosen, as <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a></span>; whence he concluded they should be at last wholly sanctified and finally preserved, which is a strong argument against final apostacy from a state of grace; though many that are outwardly called are never sanctified, much less wholly. But of this call the apostle speaks not here, at least not only. And partly also upon God’s faithfulness, who had called them. He doth not say, God is able to do it, though that is true, but he is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">faithful, </span> and <span class="bld">will do it.</span> Those that are effectually called are brought into God’s covenant, where perfection and perseverance are promised, and God’s faithfulness obligeth him to make good his covenant. It is an act of grace and mercy to call men; but when called, God’s faithfulness is engaged to preserve them, and perfect the work begun: as, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:8</a></span>, the apostle tells the Corinthians, God will confirm them, to the end they might be blameless in the day of Christ; and his argument is, for <span class="ital">God is faithful, by whom ye were called, </span>& c., <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Faithful is he that calleth you,.... Into the fellowship of his Son, and to his kingdom and glory, and who continues to do so, not only externally by his word, but internally by his Spirit and grace. <p>Who also will do it. Two things the apostle mentions as the ground of confidence that the above petition, would be heard and answered; that is, that God would wholly sanctify them, and preserve the whole of them blameless to the coming of Christ; and they are the faithfulness of God, and the effectual calling of his saints. God is faithful to his word, his covenant and promises; he has promised to sanctify and cleanse his people from all their sins, and to preserve them safe to his kingdom and glory; agreeably the Arabic version renders this last clause, "and will execute his promise": and the effectual calling is a sure pledge of glorification; whom God calls he justifies and glorifies; as sure as he gives grace, he will give glory; and whom he calls to his eternal glory, he will make perfect, stablish, strengthen, and settle. The Complutensian edition reads, "who also will make your hope firm"; that is, with respect to the above things. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> Faithful <i>is</i> he that calleth you, who also will <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> do <i>it</i>.</span><p>(14) The good will and power of God is a sure strengthening and encouragement against all difficulties, of which we have a sure witness in our calling.<p>(k) Always one, and ever like himself, who indeed performs whatever he promises.
