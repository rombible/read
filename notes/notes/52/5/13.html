but it seems best, with most good commentators, ancient and modern, to construe “in love” with “esteem,” and to make “very highly” (a very enthusiastic word in the Greek) an expletive attached to “in love,” implying “hold in a most extraordinary degree of love.” The bond which binds the Christian community to their directors is not to be one of “recognition” and obedience only (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1Thessalonians 5:12</a>), but of holy affection above all.<p><span class= "bld">For their work’s sake.</span>—Our love is to be paid them not for any social or intellectual qualities they may have in themselves; it is the work which they have to do that should attract our sympathy. The original seems to mean that we are to love them, not only <span class= "ital">because they do</span> such work, but also <span class= "ital">‘for the sake of</span> their work,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to help it forward.<p><span class= "bld">Be at peace among yourselves.</span>—Discipline to be observed towards equals, as well as superiors.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:12-15 The ministers of the gospel are described by the work of their office, which is to serve and honour the Lord. It is their duty not only to give good counsel, but also to warn the flock of dangers, and reprove for whatever may be amiss. The people should honour and love their ministers, because their business is the welfare of men's souls. And the people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can to guard against any differences. But love of peace must not make us wink at sin. The fearful and sorrowful spirits, should be encouraged, and a kind word may do much good. We must bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and keep down anger, and this to all men. Whatever man do to us, we must do good to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And to esteem them very highly in love - To cherish for them an affectionate regard. The office of a minister of religion demands respect. They who are faithful in that office have a claim on the kind regards of their fellow-men. The very nature of the office requires them to do good to others, and there is no benefactor who should be treated with more affectionate regard than he who endeavors to save us from ruin; to impart to us the consolations of the gospel in affliction; and to bring us and our families to heaven.<p>For their work's sake - Not primarily as a personal matter, or on their own account, but on account of the work in which they are engaged. It is a work whose only tendency, when rightly performed, is to do good. It injures no man, but contributes to the happiness of all. It promotes intelligence, industry, order, neatness, economy, temperance, chastity, charity, and kindness in this world, and leads to eternal blessedness in the world to come. A man who sincerely devotes himself to such a work has a claim on the kind regards of his fellow-men.<p>And be at peace among yourselves - See the <a href="/mark/9-50.htm">Mark 9:50</a> note; <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>; <a href="/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. very highly&#8212;Greek, "exceeding abundantly."<p>for their work's sake&#8212;The high nature of their work alone, the furtherance of your salvation and of the kingdom of Christ, should be a sufficient motive to claim your reverential love. At the same time, the word "work," teaches ministers that, while claiming the reverence due to their office, it is not a sinecure, but a "work"; compare "labor" (even to weariness: so the Greek), 1Th 5:12.<p>be at peace among yourselves&#8212;The "and" is not in the original. Let there not only be peace between ministers and their flocks, but also no party rivalries among yourselves, one contending in behalf of some one favorite minister, another in behalf of another (Mr 9:50; 1Co 1:12; 4:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And to esteem them very highly,.... Or, as the Ethiopic version renders it, "honour them abundantly"; for such are worthy of double honour, and to be had in reputation; they should be honourably thought of, and be high in the affections of the saints, who should esteem them better than themselves, or others in the community; and should be spoke well of, and their characters vindicated from the reproach and obloquy of others; and should be spoke respectfully to, and be honourably done by; should be provided for with an honourable maintenance, which is part of the double honour due to them in <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a> and this should be <p>in love; not in fear, nor in hypocrisy and dissimulation; not in word and in tongue only, but from the heart and real affection: the Syriac version renders it, "that they be esteemed by you with more abundant love"; with an increasing love, or with greater love than is shown to the brethren in common, or to private members: and that for their works' sake; for the sake of the work of the ministry, which is a good work as well as honourable; is beneficial to the souls of men, and is for the glory of God, being diligently and faithfully performed by them; on which account they are to be valued, and not for an empty title without labour. <p>And be at peace among yourselves. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "with them"; and so the Syriac version, connecting the former clause with this, "for their works' sake have peace with them"; that is, with the ministers of the word; do not disagree with them upon every trivial occasion, or make them offenders for a word; keep up a good understanding, and cultivate love and friendship with them; "embrace them with brotherly love", as the Ethiopic version renders the words, understanding them also as relating to ministers; a difference with them is of bad consequence, and must render their ministry greatly useless and unprofitable to those who differ with them, as well as render them very uncomfortable and unfit for it. The Arabic version renders it, "in yourselves"; as referring to internal peace in their own souls, which they should be concerned for; and which only is attained to, enjoyed, and preserved, by looking to the blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of Christ: or else it may regard peace among themselves, and with one another as brethren, and as members of the same church; which as it is for their credit and reputation without doors, and for their comfort, delight, and pleasure within, in their church state and fellowship, so it tends to make the ministers of the Gospel more easy and comfortable in their work: thus the words, considered in this sense, have still a relation to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And to esteem them very highly in love for <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> their work's sake. <span class="cverse3">{8}</span> <i>And</i> be at peace among yourselves.</span><p>(d) So then, when this reason ceases, then must the honour cease.<p>(8) The maintenance of mutual harmony, is to be especially guarded.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm" title="And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.

But the requirement to esteem highly is already, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>, expressed by <span class="greekheb">εἰδέναι</span>. Add to this that <span class="greekheb">ἡγεῖσθαι</span>, in order to denote the idea of high esteem or regard, requires an additional clause, as <span class="greekheb">περὶ πλείονος</span>, or <span class="greekheb">περὶ πλείστου</span>; but the adverb <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεκπερισσῶς</span> cannot represent that additional clause. We must therefore, with Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Beza, Flatt, Pelt, Schott, Olshausen, Alford, Hofmann, Riggenbach, and others, unite <span class="greekheb">ἡγεῖσθαι</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>, by which, along with the duty of <span class="ital">high esteem</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" title="And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>, the duty of <span class="ital">love</span> toward the rulers of the church is specially brought forward. The formula <span class="greekheb">ἡγεῖσθαι τινὰ ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>, to hold a person in love, to cherish toward him a loving disposition, is not without harshness, but has its analogy in the genuine Greek construction, <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν τινὰ ἐν ὀργῇ</span> (Thucyd. ii. 18). Others less suitably compare <span class="greekheb">ἡγεῖσθαί τι ἐν κρίσει</span>, LXX. <a href="/job/35-2.htm" title="Think you this to be right, that you said, My righteousness is more than God's?">Job 35:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ ἔργον αὐτῶν</span>] <span class="ital">for their works</span>’ (office) <span class="ital">sake, i.e.</span> first, on account of the labour which is connected with it; but secondly and chiefly, because it is an office in the service of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰρηνεύετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς</span>] <span class="ital">preserve peace among yourselves</span>, comp. <a href="/romans/12-18.htm" title="If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men.">Romans 12:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell.

Chrysostom, Theodoret, Faber Stapulensis, Zwingli, Calvin, Bullinger, Balduin, Cornelius a Lapide, Ernest Schmid, Fromond., and others, adopting the reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτοῖς</span> (see critical note), have indeed explained it: “preserve peace with them, the presbyters,” but without grammatical justification, because for this <span class="greekheb">εἰρηνεύετε μετʼ αὐτῶν</span> would be required, comp. <a href="/romans/12-18.htm" title="If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men.">Romans 12:18</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm" title="And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.

So deep and warm should be the affection uniting pastors and their flocks. Their appreciation is not to be a cold esteem; it has mutual “love” for its pervading element, a grace in which the Thessalonians were already “taught of God” (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>).
