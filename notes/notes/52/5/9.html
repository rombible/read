Our moderation as to all earthly things should be known to all men. Shall Christians, who have the light of the blessed gospel shining in their faces, be careless about their souls, and unmindful of another world? We need the spiritual armour, or the three Christian graces, faith, love, and hope. Faith; if we believe that the eye of God is always upon us, that there is another world to prepare for, we shall see reason to watch and be sober. True and fervent love to God, and the things of God, will keep us watchful and sober. If we have hope of salvation, let us take heed of any thing that would shake our trust in the Lord. We have ground on which to build unshaken hope, when we consider, that salvation is by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, to atone for our sins and to ransom our souls. We should join in prayer and praise one with another. We should set a good example one before another, and this is the best means to answer the end of society. Thus we shall learn how to live to Him, with whom we hope to live for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God hath not appointed us to wrath - This is designed as an encouragement to effort to secure our salvation. The wish of God is to save us, and therefore we should watch and be sober; we should take to ourselves the whole of the Christian armor, and strive for victory. If he had appointed us to wrath, effort would have been in vain, for we could do nothing but yield to our inevitable destiny. The hope of a final triumph should animate us in our efforts, and cheer us in our struggles with our foes. How much does the hope of victory animate the soldier in battle! When morally certain of success, how his arm is nerved! When everything conspires to favor him, and when he seems to feel that God fights for him, and intends to give him the victory, how his heart exults, and how strong is he in battle! Hence, it was a great point among the ancients, when about entering into battle, to secure evidence that the gods favored them, and meant to give them the victory.<p>For this purpose they offered sacrifices, and consulted the flight of birds and the entrails of animals; and for this armies were accompanied by soothsayers and priests, that they might interpret any signs which might occur that would be favorable, or to propitiate the favor of the gods by sacrifice. See Homer, passim; Arrian's Expedition of Alexander, and the classic writers generally. The apostle alludes to something of this kind here. He would excite us to maintain the Christian warfare manfully, by the assurance that God intends that we shall be triumphant. This we are to learn by no conjectures of soothsayers; by no observation of the flight of birds; by no sacrifice which we can make to propitiate his favor, but by the unerring assurance of his holy word. If we are Christians, we know that he intends our salvation, and that victory will be ours; if we are willing to become Christians, we know that the Almighty arm will be stretched out to aid us, and that the "gates of hell" cannot prevent it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Christ "acquired (so the Greek for 'purchased') the Church (and its salvation) with His own blood" (Ac 20:28); each member is said to be appointed by God to the "acquiring of salvation."

Neither is this appointment of God grounded upon the foresight of man’s faith; for if faith be the gift of God, this gift proceeds from God’s counsel and fore-appointment; else men may say: That I may be saved I must thank God, but that I am saved I must thank myself: and hence there is a possibility for no man to be saved, and all the counsels of God in Christ to be made frustrate.

And those that are saved are delivered from it; and the supreme reason is, because they were not appointed to it, but to salvation, and none that are appointed to the one are appointed to the other.

And whereas the apostle calls it the obtaining of salvation, it implies man’s endeavours for it, though he be appointed of God to it; and speaking positively, not only of himself, but these believing Thessalonians also, he <span class="ital">hath appointed us to obtain salvation, </span> doth not this also imply that some good assurance of salvation may be obtained in this world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By our Lord Jesus Christ; </span> the decrees of salvation are executed in him, and by him; and <span class="ital">there is no salvation in any other, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/acts/4-12.htm" title="Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.">Acts 4:12</a></span>. And he saveth not only by his doctrine and example, as some have affirmed, but by his blood as the meritorious, and his Spirit as the efficient, cause of salvation. Whether the infinite wisdom of God could have found out another way I shall not inquire, but this it hath pitched upon, wherein mercy and justice are admirably glorified together, and the highest engagement imaginable laid upon men to love, serve, and honour their Creator. And as the freeness of God’s grace is manifested in his appointing men to salvation, so the exceeding riches of it, in saving them by Jesus Christ. And whereas two things are necessary to it, the reconciling us unto God, and restoring his image in us, the former we have by the merit of his blood, and the latter by the operation of his Spirit; so that we have no ground for that fond opinion, that if men walk honestly and uprightly, they may be saved in any religion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For God hath not appointed us to wrath,.... To destruction and ruin, the effect of wrath; though there are some that are vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction, of old ordained to condemnation, and who are reserved for the day of evil; but there are others who are equally children of wrath, as deserving of the wrath of God in themselves as others, who are not appointed to it; which is an instance of wonderful and distinguishing grace to them: <p>but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ; salvation is alone by Christ, he alone has wrought it out; it is in him, and in no other; he was appointed to this work, was called and sent, and came to do it, and has done it; and God's elect, who were chosen in him, are appointed in the counsel and purpose of God, to obtain, possess, and enjoy this salvation; and which, as this appointment may be known, as it was by these Thessalonians; the Gospel having come to them, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as it is an encouragement to faith and hope, so it excites to sobriety and watchfulness, and the discharge of every duty. The doctrine of predestination does not lead to despair, but encourages the hope of salvation; and it is no licentious doctrine, for election to salvation by Christ is through sanctification of the Spirit, and unto holiness; and good works are the fruits of it, and are what God has foreordained his people should walk in. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><p>(4) He urges us forward by setting a most certain hope of victory before us.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>.

In all these instances it points beyond the present attainment of salvation, still subject to trial and hazard, to the full realisation thereof, which is the object of the Christian’s hope (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>), as it is the end of God’s designs for him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Salvation,” in St Paul and in the N. T. generally, includes the whole of the benefits and blessings of the Gospel, the entire new life and well-being that it brings, both to the individual man and to the world; but it is referred more specifically to two essential elements, or moments, in the great process of renewal—(1) that spoken of in <a href="/luke/1-77.htm" title="To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,">Luke 1:77</a> as “knowledge of salvation … in <span class="ital">remission of sins</span>,” and (2) to man’s <span class="ital">deliverance from the grave</span> and entrance on the risen life of the future world,—“salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory” (<a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). In the word <span class="ital">redemption</span> this double reference is even more conspicuous: see, e.g., <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>. To this ultimate “salvation” the Apostle directs his readers’ thoughts and hopes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Appointed” reminds us of “election” (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>, see note); it implies the <span class="ital">authority</span> with which God called the Thessalonians to salvation (comp. ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>), as well as the fact of His gracious <span class="ital">intention</span> respecting them. Comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, “appointing me to service,” and ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.">1 Thessalonians 3:3</a> above.

With the thought of Christ’s second coming, so constantly present to St Paul’s mind at this time (see <span class="ital">Introd.</span> pp. 18–21), there were present also the issues of the Last Judgement and its solemn contrast—the glorious “salvation” then to be attained by the sons of God, and the final and awful manifestation of His “anger” against the wicked. Similarly “the day of the Lord” is seen in <a href="/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a> as a “day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgement of God;” and in this light, wrath and future salvation are contrasted in <a href="/context/romans/5-9.htm" title="Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him....">Romans 5:9-10</a>, just as they are here. There also, as in this passage, Christ’s <span class="ital">death</span> (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm" title="Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.">1 Thessalonians 5:10</a>) is set forth as our ground of hope in this prospect; through “His blood” we are brought from the sense and fear of God’s anger into His favour, and entitled to expect that eternal redemption will be ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It was the conviction that such is God’s <span class="ital">purpose and will</span> respecting those who believe in Christ that made St Paul’s “helmet of salvation so strong, and gave it all its splendour.
