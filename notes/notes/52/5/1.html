The apostle having described the coming of Christ to raise the dead, judge the world, and carry the righteous with him to heaven, does not quit the awful subject, but proceeds in this chapter to foretel the terror which his appearance will occasion to the unrighteous, and the punishment which he will then inflict on them: a circumstance this which merits the reader’s attention, because it proves that, in describing Christ’s second coming, the apostle had some further end in view besides that of comforting the Thessalonians under the death of their relations. <span class="ital">But of the times </span>— As if he had said, I have been warning you that the solemn day of universal judgment will certainly come, and have been endeavouring to lead your minds to those views of it which must be consolatory to every true believer; but concerning the precise period of time when this grand event, which will close the economy of providence, shall take place; or of <span class="ital">the seasons — </span>Which God hath appointed for the accomplishment of his promises and predictions, preparatory thereto; <span class="ital">you have no need that I write unto you </span>— No occasion to know these things particularly, since the general knowledge thereof is sufficient to render you watchful, and to excite you to make preparation for them. It is probable that, when he was with them, he had repeated to them Christ’s injunction to watch, <span class="ital">because at such an hour as men think not, the Son of man cometh, </span><a href="/matthew/24-44.htm" title="Therefore be you also ready: for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man comes.">Matthew 24:44</a>. By making this observation, the apostle represses that vain curiosity which is natural to mankind, who, not content with the knowledge of things useful, indulge an immoderate desire of searching into things which, because the discovery of them would be hurtful, God hath determined to conceal. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ's coming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering!

Of the coming of Christ, his "appointed time" and "his day", as the Ethiopic version renders it; of the resurrection of the dead in Christ first, and of the rapture of all the saints in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, things treated of in the preceding chapter: and which might excite a curiosity to know the times and seasons of them; as in what year they would come to pass; in what season of the year, whether winter or summer; in what month, and on what day of the month; and whether in the night season, or in the daytime; and in what hour, whether at midnight, cockcrowing, morning, or noonday: to repress which the apostle observes, <p>ye have no need that I write unto you; to write to them concerning the things themselves was necessary and useful, to stir up and encourage their faith, hope, and expectation of them; to allay their grief for departed friends, and to comfort one another under the various trials and exercises of life; but to write to them about the time of these things would be trifling and unnecessary, would be an idle speculation, and an indulging a vain curiosity; and, besides, was impracticable: for of that day and hour knows no man; the times and seasons the Father hath put in his own power; for these things are equally true of Christ's second coming, as of the kingdom of Christ coming with power and glory, and of the destruction of Jerusalem, <a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>.

See Tittmann, <span class="ital">de synonym.</span> I. p. 39 ff. Paul puts the <span class="ital">plural</span>, because he thinks on a plurality of acts or incidents, in which partly preparation is made for the advent (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a> ff.), and partly it is accomplished. That, moreover, the apostle, although he has not treated of the advent in itself, but only of an <span class="ital">entirely special</span> objection regarding it, feels necessitated also to make the commencement of the advent a subject of explanation, is an evident intimation that this point also formed the subject of frequent discussion among the Thessalonians. Yet on account of the relation of the second Epistle to the first, the opinion that the return of Christ was <span class="ital">immediately</span> to be expected was not yet diffused.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε</span>] a <span class="ital">praeteritio</span>, as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>. The reason why the readers did not require instruction on the time and hour of the advent, is neither because instruction concerning it would not be useful to them (Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀσύμφορον</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὁ δέ γε Παῦλος ἴσως ᾔδει αὐτό</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ἀῤῥήτων καὶ τοῦτο καθών</span>, Theophylact, and others), nor also because no instruction <span class="ital">can be given</span> concerning it (Zwingli, Hunnius, Estius, Fromond., Flatt, Pelt, Baumgarten-Crusius, Koch, and others), but because the Thessalonians were already sufficiently <span class="ital">acquainted</span> with it from the oral instruction of the apostle. Accordingly the apostle adds—<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you....">1 Thessalonians 5:1-11</a>. <span class="greekheb">περὶ τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">But of the times and the seasons</span>] Better, <span class="bld">concerning the times and the seasons</span>. The Greek word for “times” denotes <span class="ital">stretches of time</span>, that for seasons <span class="ital">particular times</span>; the question as to the former was, “How long before the Lord comes? what periods will elapse before the final establishment of His kingdom?” as to the second, “What events will transpire meanwhile? how will the course of history shape itself?” These enquiries our Lord put aside. “It is not for you,” said He, “to know times or seasons, which the Father has put within His own province” (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>); and previously Jesus had declared respecting the end of the world, “Of that day and hour knoweth no man, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son,—only the Father” (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>). Such knowledge, it appears, is outside the province of human thought. Speculations of this nature have been repeatedly ventured on since the Apostle’s day; they have proved invariably worthless, and afford so many confirmations of the Lord’s warning. Chrysostom remarks on this passage somewhat severely: “Our nature is officious and greedy for the knowledge of things invisible and hidden from us. This comes of our conceit, and from having nothing to do. Often therefore is the mind in haste to learn and understand these things before the time.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye have no need that</span> I <span class="ital">write unto you</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">that aught he written to you</span> (R. V.). The phrase is a repetition of that of ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>, except that there the emphasis lies on <span class="ital">you</span> as persons not needing this instruction, here upon the <span class="ital">writing</span> as a thing in itself needless. On the topic of the last paragraph, viz. the position of Christians dying before the Lord’s return, it <span class="ital">was</span> needful that something should be written; as to the “times and seasons” nothing need be <span class="ital">written</span>, for the readers already <span class="ital">knew</span> so much as could be known (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Section VI. (continued): <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you....">1 Thessalonians 5:1-11</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first part of this Chapter stands in close connection with the last six verses of ch. 4. Together they form the most distinctive and the weightiest section of the Epistle. The two paragraphs of the section touch upon two different aspects of our Lord’s Coming, viewed first <span class="ital">as it concerns departed Christians</span>, and then <span class="ital">in its relation to men living on the earth</span>. The former passage supplies comfort respecting the dead in Christ, the latter enjoins watchfulness and preparedness upon the living. See note introductory to ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you....">1 Thessalonians 5:1-2</a></span> it appears likely that the Thessalonians had been enquiring from St Paul “about the times and the seasons” of Christ’s return and the Day of Judgement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1 Thessalonians 5:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περὶ τῶν χρόνων</span>, <span class="ital">of the times</span>) When these things shall happen, which I have mentioned. <span class="greekheb">Καιροί</span>, <span class="ital">seasons</span>, are parts <span class="greekheb">χρόνων</span>, of the <span class="ital">times</span>.[24]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΧΡΕΊΑΝ ἜΧΕΤΕ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">ye have no need</span>) Those who watch do not require to be told when the hour will come; for they are always ready.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[24] <span class="greekheb">Χρόνος</span> gives the notion of indefinite time; <span class="greekheb">Καιρός</span>, <span class="ital">the</span> time, the opportune point of time, when a thing should be done.

The apostle was comforting the Thessalonians under the loss of their deceased friends by the assurance that both the living and the dead would be gathered together at the advent. The question would naturally arise, "When shall these things be?" (<a href="/luke/21-7.htm">Luke 21:7</a>); and it would appear that the Thessalonians expected an immediate advent. The apostle represses their curiosity on this point by reminding them of the uncertainty of the time of the Lord's coming. <span class="cmt_word">But of the times and the seasons, brethren</span>; that is, of the time and the precise period of the Lord's advent. "Times" and "seasons" are elsewhere united together (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). The word translated "times" denotes time absolutely without regard to circumstances; and the word rendered "seasons" denotes a definite point of time; not merely the day, but the hour (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have no need that I write unto you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that ought be written unto you</span> (R.V.); comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>. The reason why it was not needful for the apostle to write unto them was, not because he regarded the information unprofitable or superfluous, or because he knew it to be impossible, but because he had already informed them when at Thessalonica that the time of the advent was beyond the sphere of his teaching. The apostle mentions this to repress that vain curiosity which is natural to man, and which was the occasion of so much disorder among the Thessalonians. Our duty is, not to pry into the times and seasons which the Father hath put in his own power (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), but to exercise constant watchfulness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Times - seasons (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>. With special reference to the Lord's coming. The plural is used because Paul is thinking of a number of incidents attending the preparation and accomplishment of the second advent, and occurring at different times. The collocation times and seasons only here and <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; is the suitable time, &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; the time measured by duration. Hence &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; a juncture, an occasion, as <a href="/matthew/16-3.htm">Matthew 16:3</a>. The distinction is so well marked that have the phrases &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; the right moment of the time, and &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; the opportune moment.
