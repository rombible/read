It is their duty not only to give good counsel, but also to warn the flock of dangers, and reprove for whatever may be amiss. The people should honour and love their ministers, because their business is the welfare of men's souls. And the people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can to guard against any differences. But love of peace must not make us wink at sin. The fearful and sorrowful spirits, should be encouraged, and a kind word may do much good. We must bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and keep down anger, and this to all men. Whatever man do to us, we must do good to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See that none render evil for evil - See the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>. The meaning here is, that we are not to take vengeance; compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>, <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>. This law is positive, and is universally binding. The moment we feel ourselves acting from a desire to "return evil for evil," that moment we are acting wrong. It may be right to defend our lives and the lives of our friends; to seek the protection of the law for our persons, reputation, or property, against those who would wrong us; to repel the assaults of calumniators and slanderers, but in no case should the motive be to do them wrong for the evil which they have done us.<p>But ever follow that which is good - Which is benevolent, kind, just, generous; see the notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20-21</a>.<p>Both among yourselves, and to all men - The phrase "to all men," seems to have been added to avoid the possibility of misconstruction. Some might possibly suppose that this was a good rule to be observed toward those of their own number, but that a greater latitude in avenging injuries might be allowable toward their enemies out of the church. The apostle, therefore, says that the rule is universal. It relates to the pagan, to infidels, sceptics, and persecutors, as well as to the members of the church. To every man we are to do good as we are able - no matter what they do to us. This is the rule which God himself observes toward the evil and unthankful (notes, <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>), and is one of the original and beautiful laws of our holy religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

But it is to be understood of private revenge rising out of malice, not of public censures, either civil or ecclesiastical, or of seeking reparations for injuries received in courts of justice according to law and equity. This private revenge cannot consist with that patience that he required towards all men in the foregoing verse, nor is it conformable to the example of Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1 Peter 2:23</a></span>, nor to the Christian calling and profession, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1 Peter 2:21</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

And the word <span class="bld">follow</span> signifies an earnest following, which is sometimes taken in a bad sense, for persecution, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a></span>, and sometimes in a good sense, as <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm" title="Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:">Hebrews 12:14</a> <a href="/1_peter/3-11.htm" title="Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.">1 Peter 3:11</a></span>; and to follow good imports more than only to do good, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_peter/3-11.htm" title="Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.">1 Peter 3:11</a></span>, when the inward bent of the soul and the outward endeavours are towards doing good. And this ought to be <span class="ital">ever, </span> or always, that is, in all places, times, occasions, company. Man’s course of life ought in this to be uniform, though his outward condition vary; sometimes to do good to the souls, sometimes to the bodies of men, and that either in a privative or positive good; preventing evil, or bestowing that which is good. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Both among yourselves, and to all men:</span> <span class="ital">Do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a></span>. As they say of good, the commoner the better; but the contrary of evil. Christians stand in a special relation to one another, but in a common relation to all, and every relation ought to be filled up with good. As love is a common debt to all men, so the fruit of it, which is doing good. Our doing good should not be confined among Christians only of one way, opinion, or congregation; nor to men only under some limiting circumstances; but it should reach all men as we have ability, opportuniy, and call, even enemies themselves, as our Saviour requires, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a></span>. This is to act like God, and may commend religion to all men, and is not to be looked upon as commended by way of counsel, as the papists say, but commanded by precept. And it is not enough not to do evil, but we must do good: not to save a man’s life when we have power to do it, is to kill him, as Christ argues, <span class="bld"><a href="/mark/3-4.htm" title="And he said to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.">Mark 3:4</a></span>; so not to save a man’s estate when we may, is to steal from him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>See that none render evil for evil unto any man,....

Philoct.</span> 679; Jacobs, <span class="ital">ad Delect. Epigr.</span> p. 144) nor to that of Judaism (comp. <a href="/matthew/5-38.htm" title="You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:">Matthew 5:38</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-43.htm" title="You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.">Matthew 5:43</a>). But de Wette’s reason makes the prohibition appear as if it were something long known, something evident of itself. (2) Also the better disposed are not free from momentary thoughts of revenge; accordingly also upon them was that prohibition to be pressed. (3) The fulfilling of that command appertains to the individual life of every one; whereas to guard against the outbreaks of revenge among <span class="ital">others</span> is only rarely possible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κακὸν ἀντὶ κακοῦ τινι ἀποδοῦναι</span>] to render to any one evil for evil, comp. <a href="/romans/12-17.htm" title="Recompense to no man evil for evil.

The Thessalonian Christians were receiving much evil from the world; possibly some of its members were wronging others: there must be no retaliation. “Blows may fall on you; you must never return them.” This command is linked closely with the last; for while that bids each man restrain his own anger, this requires him to check the resentful spirit wherever it appears. It is a reproach to all, a discredit to the common faith, when a Christian gives back wrong for wrong.
