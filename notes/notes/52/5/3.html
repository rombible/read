<a href="/luke/12-20.htm" title="But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?">Luke 12:20</a>, margin; <a href="/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>, probably; <a href="/context/luke/23-29.htm" title="For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never gave suck.">Luke 23:29-31</a>). Of course, however, no <span class= "ital">Christian</span> could say so, for they are ever on the watch, so that “they” will mean “the world.” The word “for” at the beginning of the verse should (according to the best MSS.) be struck out—the abruptness helps to enforce the lesson.<p><span class= "bld">Peace and safety.</span>—Carrying on the thought suggested by the word “night; they are taking their repose in security, without dreaming of any interruption to their slumbers. Is it possible that there may here be a faint recollection of the parable related in <a href="/context/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1-13</a>?<p><span class= "bld">Destruction cometh upon them.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">stands over them;</span> or <span class= "ital">takes its stand over them; presents itself.</span> The present tense is used for the sake of a more vivid effect. The extreme similarity of this passage to <a href="/luke/21-34.htm" title="And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on you unawares.">Luke 21:34</a> (with other indications) inclines Bishop Wordsworth to think that the Thessalonians had the Gospel of St. Luke to refer to.<p><span class= "bld">As travail.</span>—A common Oriental simile to express not only suddenness, but horror also. Theodoret fairly says, “The woman with child knows that she has the child to bear, but knows not the exact time for her pangs; so we also know that the Lord of all will appear, but the moment itself we have by no means been explicitly taught.” The comment, however, hardly suits this passage, as the persons on whom the destruction will thus burst are not persons who live in <span class= "ital">any</span> expectation of such a judgment.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 It is needless or useless to ask about the particular time of Christ's coming. Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, and guard against our spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For when they shall say, Peace and safety - That is, when the wicked shall say this, for the apostle here refers only to those on whom "sudden destruction" will come; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36-42</a> notes; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3-4</a> notes. It is clear from this:<p>(1) that when the Lord Jesus shall come the world will not all be converted. There will be some to be "destroyed." How large this proportion will be, it is impossible now to ascertain. This supposition, however, is not inconsistent with the belief that there will be a general prevalence of the gospel before that period.<p>(2) the impenitent and wicked world will be sunk in carnal security when he comes. They will regard themselves as safe. They will see no danger. They will give no heed to warning. They will be unprepared for his advent. So it has always been. it seems to be a universal truth in regard to all the visitations of God to wicked people for punishment, that he comes upon them at a time when they are not expecting him, and that they have no faith in the predictions of his advent. So it was in the time of the flood; in the destruction of Sodom Gomorrah, and Jerusalem; in the overthrow of Babylon: so it is when the sinner dies, and so it will be when the Lord Jesus shall return to judge the world. One of the most remarkable facts about the history of man is, that he takes no warning from his Maker; he never changes his plans, or feels any emotion, because his Creator "thunders damnation along his path," and threatens to destroy him in hell.<p>Sudden destruction - Destruction that was unforeseen (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  aiphnidios) or unexpected. The word here rendered "sudden," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>, "Lest that day come upon you unawares." The word rendered "destruction" - &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  olethros - occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>, in all of which places it is correctly translated destruction. The word destruction is familiar to us. It means, properly, demolition; pulling down; the annihilation of the form of anything, or that form of parts which constitutes it what it is; as the destruction of grass by eating; of a forest by cutting down the trees; of life by murder; of the soul by consigning it to misery. It does not necessarily mean annihilation - for a house or city is not annihilated which is pulled down or burnt; a forest is not annihilated which is cut down; and a man is not annihilated whose character and happiness are destroyed. In regard to the destruction here referred to, we may remark:<p>(1) it will be after the return of the Lord Jesus to judgment; and hence it is not true that the wicked experience all the punishment which they ever will in the present life;<p>(2) that it seems fairly implied that the destruction which they will then suffer will not be annihilation, but will be connected with conscious existence; and,<p>(3) that they will then be cut off from life and hope and salvation.<p>How can the solemn affirmation that they will be "destroyed suddenly," be consistent with the belief that all people will be saved? Is it the same thing to be destroyed and to be saved? Does the Lord Jesus, when he speaks of the salvation of his people, say that he comes to destroy them?<p>As travail upon a woman with child - This expression is sometimes used to denote great consternation, as in <a href="/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9-10</a>; great pain, as <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>; <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>; or the suddenness with which anything occurs; <a href="/jeremiah/13-21.htm">Jeremiah 13:21</a>. It seems here to be used to denote two things; first, that the coming of the Lord to a wicked world will be sudden; and, secondly, that it will be an event of the most distressing and overwhelming nature.<p>And they shall not escape - That is, the destruction, or punishment. They calculated on impunity, but now the time will have come when none of these refuges will avail them, and no rocks will cover them from the "wrath to come." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. they&#8212;the men of the world. 1Th 5:5, 6; 1Th 4:13, "others," all the rest of the world save Christians.<p>Peace&#8212;(Jud 18:7, 9, 27, 28; Jer 6:14; Eze 13:10).<p>then&#8212;at the very moment when they least expect it.

Or men shall say, that is, wicked and ungodly men, persons in a state of unregeneracy: <p>peace and safety; when they shall sing a requiem, to themselves, promise themselves much ease and peace for years to come, and imagine their persons and property to be very secure from enemies and oppressors, and shall flatter themselves with much and long temporal happiness: <p>then sudden destruction cometh upon them; as on the men of the old world in the times of Noah, and on the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah in the days of Lot; for as these, will be the days of the Son of man, as at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, so at the last day; see <a href="/luke/17-26.htm">Luke 17:26</a> and as was the destruction of literal Babylon, so of Babylon in a mystical sense, or antichrist and his followers: and which will be <p>as travail upon a woman with child; whose anguish and pains are very sharp, the cause of which is within herself, and which come suddenly upon her, and are unavoidable; and so the metaphor expresses the sharpness and severity of the destruction of the wicked, thus the calamities on the Jewish nation are expressed by a word which signifies the sorrows, pangs, and birth throes of a woman in travail, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>, and likewise that the cause of it is from themselves, their own sins and transgressions; and also the suddenness of it, which will come upon them in the midst of all their mirth, jollity, and security; and moreover, the inevitableness of it, it will certainly come at the full and appointed time, though that is not known: <p>and they shall not escape; the righteous judgment of God, the wrath of the Lamb, or falling into his hands; to escape is impossible, rocks, hills, and mountains will not cover and hide them; before the judgment seat of Christ they must stand, and into everlasting punishment must they go. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>. Paul carries on in a vivid manner (therefore <span class="ital">asyndetically</span>) the description of the sudden and unexpected nature in which the advent is to break in, whilst he indicates that precisely at the time when man fancies himself in the greatest security, the advent will occur. But with this thought is the wider and more special thought blended, that they who dream of security and serve earthly things will reap the fruit of their carelessness, namely, destruction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅταν λέγωσιν</span>] <span class="ital">when they shall say, when it is said</span>. As the subject of the verb, the apostle naturally thinks not on the inhabitants of Jerusalem (Harduin), but, as is evident from the nature of the expression of opinion added, and from the apodosis, unbelievers and merely nominal Christians, the children of this world; comp. <a href="/matthew/24-38.htm" title="For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,">Matthew 24:38</a> ff.; <a href="/luke/17-26.htm" title="And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.">Luke 17:26</a> ff. For the pious and true Christian never abandons himself to the feeling of security, but is always mindful of his salvation with fear and trembling; comp. <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια</span>] <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span>; comp. <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm" title="Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, see, others daubed it with untempered mortar:">Ezekiel 13:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐφίσταται</span>] imminet, or <span class="ital">it surprises them</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκφύγωσιν</span>] stands absolutely.

Moreover, de Wette justly remarks, that in the comparison of the pangs of a pregnant woman, the supposition is contained that the advent is close at hand; for although the day and the hour, indeed, is not known to her, yet the period of her bearing is proximately known. Comp.

Lastly, it is evident from the context that it is by no means the design of the apostle to explain that the day of the Lord will befall <span class="ital">Christians prepared</span>, but <span class="ital">unbelievers unprepared</span>; but he purposes to remind them only of the <span class="ital">sudden and unexpected entrance of the advent itself</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>-3<a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief....">1 Thessalonians 5:4-11</a>.

A reminiscence of <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm" title="Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, see, others daubed it with untempered mortar:">Ezekiel 13:10</a>, “Saying Peace, and there was no peace!” Such times of security are pregnant with judgement to the wicked, and premonitory of some “day of the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">then sudden destruction cometh upon them</span>] Or, in the vivid order of St Paul’s Greek, <span class="bld">then suddenly over them stands destruction</span>. Without a moment’s warning ruin comes,—not seen approaching, but first visible <span class="ital">hanging over</span> the doomed transgressors! We hear again Christ’s warning of <a href="/luke/21-34.htm" title="And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on you unawares.">Luke 21:34</a>, “lest that day come upon you <span class="ital">suddenly</span> (a Greek word found only in these two places in the N. T.), as a snare; for so will it come on all them that dwell on the face of all the earth.” Christ compares His advent to the coming of the Flood “in the days of Noah” (<a href="/context/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only....">Matthew 24:36-39</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle describes the calamity under another figure, frequently applied in the O.
