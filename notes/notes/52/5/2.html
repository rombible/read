and this day can mean nothing else than the great day of His return to judgment. The expression is taken from the Old Testament, where, of course, it does not primarily mean what we call “the Day of Judgment,” but the set time which God has fixed for any great visitation. Thus in <a href="/joel/2-1.htm" title="Blow you the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD comes, for it is near at hand;">Joel 2:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq., </span>it means the time appointed for the plague of locusts; in <a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm" title="You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:5</a>, generally, any day when God visits His people; in <a href="/joel/3-14.htm" title="Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.">Joel 3:14</a>, the fixed time for vengeance to be taken upon the heathen for persecuting the Church; which, in <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a> (a passage largely influenced by recollections of Joel), seems to widen into a general day of judgment for mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh.</span>—Not merely, <span class= "ital">will come; </span>it is an absolute certainty that the time is on its way to come. (See Note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1Thessalonians 1:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">As a thief in the night</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> unexpectedly (<a href="/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>), and under cover of darkness. The frequency of the simile (see references) throws light on the words “know perfectly,” making it apparent that it was the ordinary formula in which the doctrine was universally taught by the Apostles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night....">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>. </span><span class="ital">For yourselves know perfectly </span>— It being a matter plainly revealed both by Christ and his apostles; <span class="ital">that the day of the Lord </span>— That great decisive day, to which our eyes and hearts are so much directed; <span class="ital">so cometh as a thief in the night — </span>Cometh suddenly and unexpectedly; and will occasion the greatest consternation to the ungodly. This comparison is used by our Lord himself to illustrate the unexpectedness of his coming, <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>. It is used by St. Peter also, <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a>; see likewise <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm" title="Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore you shall not watch, I will come on you as a thief, and you shall not know what hour I will come on you.">Revelation 3:3</a>. The ancients, from this comparison, and from the parable of the virgins, fancying that Christ’s coming to judgment would be in the night, instituted their vigils, in order that at his coming he might find them watching. But the true meaning of the comparison is, that, like the coming of a thief in the night, on those who are asleep and unarmed, the coming of Christ will be unexpected, and full of terror to the wicked; without determining whether it will be in the daytime or in the night. <span class="ital">For when they </span>— The men of the world; <span class="ital">shall say — </span>Shall promise to one another; <span class="ital">peace and safety — </span>And shall fear no evil of any kind; <span class="ital">then sudden destruction cometh upon them </span>— And a destruction of the most terrible kind; <span class="ital">as travail upon a woman with child </span>— “Nothing can be conceived more forcible to represent the anguish and torment of the wicked, occasioned by the stinging of their own consciences, and by the horrid fears which shall be excited in them, when they find themselves over-taken by the judgment, than to compare it to the pains of child- bearing.” <span class="ital">And they shall not escape </span>— Condemnation and punishment at that terrible day.

Christ did not reveal this to the apostles. There are times and seasons for us to work in, and these are our duty and interest to know and observe; but as to the time when we must give up our account, we know it not, nor is it needful that we should. The coming of Christ will be a great surprise to men. Our Lord himself said so. As the hour of death is the same to each person that the judgment will be to mankind in general, so the same remarks answer for both. Christ's coming will be terrible to the ungodly. Their destruction will overtake them while they dream of happiness, and please themselves with vain amusements. There will be no means to escape the terror or the punishment of that day. This day will be a happy day to the righteous. They are not in darkness; they are the children of the light. It is the happy condition of all true Christians. But how many are speaking peace and safety to themselves, over whose heads utter destruction is hovering! Let us endeavour to awaken ourselves and each other, and guard against our spiritual enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For yourselves know perfectly - That is, they had been fully taught this. There could be no doubt in their minds respecting it.<p>The day of the Lord so cometh - Of the Lord Jesus - for so the word "Lord" in the New Testament commonly means; see the notes, <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>. The "day of the Lord" means that day in which he will be manifested, or in which he will be the prominent object in view of the assembled universe.<p>As a thief in the night - Suddenly and unexpectedly, as a robber breaks into a dwelling. A thief comes without giving any warning, or any indications of his approach. He not only gives none, but he is careful that none shall be given. It is a point with him that, if possible, the man whose house he is about to rob shall have no means of ascertaining his approach until he comes suddenly upon him; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-43</a> notes; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39-40</a> notes. In this way the Lord Jesus will return to judgment; and this proves that all the attempts to determine the day, the year, or the century when he will come, must be fallacious. He intends that his coming to this world shall be sudden and unexpected, "like that of a thief in the night;" that there shall be no such indications of his approach that it shall not be sudden and unexpected; and that no warning of it shall be given so that people may know the time of his appearing. If this be not the point of the comparison in expressions like this, what is it? Is there anything else in which his coming will resemble that of a thief? And if this be the true point of comparison, how can it be true that people can ascertain when that is to occur? Assuredly, if they can, his coming will not be like that of a thief; comp. notes on <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. as a thief in the night&#8212;The apostles in this image follow the parable of their Lord, expressing how the Lord's coming shall take men by surprise (Mt 24:43; 2Pe 3:10). "The night is wherever there is quiet unconcern" [Bengel]. "At midnight" (perhaps figurative: to some parts of the earth it will be literal night), Mt 25:6. The thief not only gives no notice of his approach but takes all precaution to prevent the household knowing of it. So the Lord (Re 16:15).

In the O.T. therefore, the Day of the Lord has chiefly, if not exclusively, a judicial aspect. This meaning the expression carries over into the N.T.; and “the day of the Lord” is synonymous with “the day of Judgement” (<a href="/matthew/11-22.htm" title="But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.">Matthew 11:22</a>, &c.)—often called simply “that day” (<a href="/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a>; <a href="/luke/17-31.htm" title="In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.">Luke 17:31</a>; &c.), also “the last day” (<a href="/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39</a>, &c.). Moreover Christ ascribes to Himself, “the Son of Man” (<a href="/luke/17-24.htm" title="For as the lightning, that lightens out of the one part under heaven, shines to the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.">Luke 17:24</a>; <a href="/luke/17-26.htm" title="And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.">Luke 17:26</a>; <a href="/luke/17-30.htm" title="Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.">Luke 17:30</a>), what the O. T. in this connection predicts of “the Lord” (Jehovah). Hence St Paul describes the same Day of the Lord as “the day of Jesus Christ” (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm" title="Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:">Php 1:6</a>, &c.). But our Apostle loves to regard the Day on its brighter side, as the time when Christ’s glory will be revealed in His people (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.">2 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Php 2:16</a>; &c.), “when He comes to be glorified in His saints and wondered at in all that believed.” Now the world is having its day; “this is your hour,” said Jesus to those who seized Him, “and the reign of darkness” (<a href="/luke/22-53.htm" title="When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.">Luke 22:53</a>). But that will be <span class="ital">the Lord’s</span> day, when the Lord and His Christ will be manifested, and vindicated whether in salvation or judgement,—when “the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together” (<a href="/isaiah/40-5.htm" title="And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.">Isaiah 40:5</a>). Afterwards the weekly day of Christ’s resurrection came to be called “the Lord’s Day,” as we call it now (<a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>)—this also a day of Divine vindication, and a pledge and foretaste of the final and perfect Day of the Lord: comp. the connection of the resurrection of Jesus with the Last Judgement in ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a> and <a href="/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have already observed a tacit reference under the words “as a thief in the night” to our Lord’s discourse on the Judgement; and we shall find others in the sequel. These allusions make one think that the Apostle in his preaching at Thessalonica had surely quoted from Christ’s words on this solemn theme. Otherwise, how would the Thessalonians “precisely know” that “the Day comes as a thief in the night”? While in regard to the state of the sainted dead a new revelation was needed (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>), on the question of the time of His coming His own well-remembered words were sufficiently explicit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὡς κλέπτης</span>, <span class="ital">as a thief</span>) <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2 Peter 3:10</a>.

"The day of the Lord" is a common Old Testament expression, denoting the coming of the Divine judgments (<a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>); and by the phrase here is meant, not the destruction of Jerusalem, nor the day of one's death, but the day of the Lord's advent, when Christ shall descend from heaven in glory for the resurrection of the dead and the judgment of the world. The idea of judgment is contained in the term "day." <span class="cmt_word">So cometh as a thief in the night</span>. The same comparison is used by our Lord himself (<a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>), and the very words are employed by Peter (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). The point of resemblance is evidently the unexpectedness and suddenness of the coming. The thief comes upon people in the night season, when they are asleep and unprepared; so, in a similar manner, when Christ comes, he will find the world unprepared and not expecting his advent. The ancient Fathers inferred from this passage that Christ would come to judgment in the night season, and hence they instituted vigils, or night watches. Some, still more precisely, fixed the coming on Easter night, from the analogy of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt on the paschal evening. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Perfectly (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>.<p>The day of the Lord (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>The day of Christ's second coming.

These expressions refer to a definite time when the Lord is expected to appear, and Paul expects this appearance soon. Attempts to evade this by referring such expressions to the day of death, or to the advance toward perfection after death until the final judgment, are forced, and are shaped by dogmatic conceptions of the nature of Biblical inspiration. In the O.T. the phrase day of the Lord denotes a time in which God will conspicuously manifest his power and goodness or his penal justice.

This gave rise to the custom of vigils. Jerome, on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/25-6.htm">Matthew 25:6</a>, says: "It is a tradition of the Jews that Messiah will come at midnight, after the likeness of that season in Egypt when the Passover was celebrated, and the Destroyer came, and the Lord passed over the dwellings. I think that this idea was perpetuated in the apostolic custom, that, on the day of vigils, at the Pascha, it was not allowed to dismiss the people before midnight, since they expected the advent of Christ." It is noteworthy how many of the gospel lessons on watchfulness are associated with the night and a visit by night.
