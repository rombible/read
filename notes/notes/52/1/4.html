The tense of the word “beloved” represents not only God’s attitude to them in the present, but the long continuance of it in the past, especially as proved by His election of them.

St. Paul rejoices, because the continued possession of spiritual privileges, used or abused, is an assurance of God’s continued “favour and goodness towards us.” Of course, however, this observation does not much affect the mysterious doctrine of predestination. The question must still remain why God brings some in this life to the knowledge of His truth, and others not; but the observation, at any rate, destroys the notion of an arbitrary damnation and salvation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by sinners, but from God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from God, as our Father, for the sake of Christ. We should pray, not only for ourselves, but for others also; remembering them without ceasing. Wherever there is a true faith, it will work; it will affect both the heart and life. Faith works by love; it shows itself in love to God, and love to our neighbour. And wherever there is a well-grounded hope of eternal life, this will appear by the exercise of patience; and it is a sign of sincerity, when in all we do, we seek to approve ourselves to God. By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the truth of it, so as not to be shaken in mind by objections and doubts; and they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their souls and everlasting condition upon the truth of the gospel revelation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God - The margin here reads, "beloved of God, your election." The difference depends merely on the pointing, and that which would require the marginal reading has been adopted by Hahn, Tittman, Bloomfield, and Griesbach. The sense is not materially varied, and the common version may be regarded as giving the true meaning. There is no great difference between "being beloved of God," and "being chosen of God." The sense then is, "knowing that you are chosen by God unto salvation;" compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>. The word "knowing" here refers to Paul himself, and to Silas and Timothy, who united with him in writing the Epistle, and in rendering thanks for the favors shown to the church at Thessalonica. The meaning is, that they had so strong confidence that they had been chosen of God as a church unto salvation, that they might say they knew it.<p>The way in which they knew it seems not to have been by direct revelation or by inspiration, but by the evidence which they had furnished, and which constituted such a proof of piety as to leave no doubt of the fact. Calvin. What this evidence was, the apostle states in the following verses. I was shown by the manner in which they embraced the gospel, and by the spirit which they had evinced under its influence The meaning here seems to be, not that all the members of the church at Thessalonica were certainly chosen of God to salvation - for, as in other churches, there might have been those there who were false professors - but that the church, as such, had given evidence that it was a true church - that it was founded on Christian principles - and that, as a church, it had furnished evidence of its "election by God." Nor can it mean, as Clarke and Bloomfield suppose, that God "had chosen and called the Gentiles to the same privileges to which he chose and called the Jews; and that as they (the Jews) had rejected the gospel, God had now elected the Gentiles in their stead;" for a considerable portion of the church was composed of Jews (see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4-5</a>), and it cannot, therefore, mean that the Gentiles had been selected in the place of the Jews. Besides, the election of the Gentiles, or any portion of the human family, to the privileges of salvation, to the neglect or exclusion of any other part, would be attended with all the difficulties which occur in the doctrine of personal and individual election. Nothing is gained on this subject in removing the difficulties, by supposing that God chooses masses of people instead of individuals. How can the one be more proper than the other? What difficulty in the doctrine of election is removed by the supposition? Why is it not as right to choose an individual as a nation? Why not as proper to reject an individual as a whole people? If this means that the church at Thessalonica had shown that it was a true church of Christ, chosen by God, then we may learn:<p>(1) that a true church owes what it has to the "election of God." It is because God has chosen it; has called it out from the world; and has endowed it in such a manner as to he a true church.<p>(2) a church may give evidence that it is chosen of God, and is a true church. There are things which it may do, which will show that it is undoubtedly such a church as God has chosen, and such as he approves. There are just principles on which a church should be organized, and there is a spirit which may be manifested by a church which will distinguish it from any other association of people.<p>(3) it is not improper to speak with strong confidence of such a church as undoubtedly chosen of God. There are churches which, by their zeal, self-denial, and deadness to the world, show beyond question their "election of God," and the world may see that they are founded on other principles and manifest a different spirit from other organizations of people.<p>(4) every church should evince such a spirit that there may be no doubt of its "election of God." It should be so dead to the world; so pure in doctrine and in practice, and so much engaged in spreading the knowledge of salvation, that the world will see that it is governed by higher principles than any worldly association, and that nothing could produce this but the influence of the Holy Spirit of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

By the manner of their receiving the gospel, and the evident operation of the graces of God’s Spirit, the apostle knew their election of God. We cannot know election as in God’s secret decree, but as made manifest in the fruits and effects of it. As there is a knowledge of things <span class="ital">a priori, </span> when we argue from the cause to the effect, so <span class="ital">a posteriori, </span> when we argue from the effects to the cause. And thus the apostle came to know their election. Not, we hope it, or conjecture it, but we know it; and not by extraordinary revelation, but by evident outward tokens. And if the apostle knew this, why should we think they themselves might not know it also; and the words may be read: Ye knowing your election of God. And election imports the choosing of some out of others; for election cannot comprehend all.

So in <a href="/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1 John 3:1</a> : “Behold what manner of love the Father <span class="ital">hath given</span> us, that we should be called sons of God!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Christian excellence of the Thessalonians, therefore, moved the Apostle and his companions to thanksgiving (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;...">1 Thessalonians 1:2-3</a></span>), not simply on its own account, but because it marked them out as <span class="ital">the objects of God’s loving choice</span>. The word <span class="bld">election</span>, here occurring for the first time in St Paul’s Epistles, and expressing one of his most important doctrines, needs to be carefully studied. The N. T. use of the word originates in the O. T. idea of Israel as God’s “peculiar possession,” “the people whom He chose for His inheritance” (see <a href="/psalms/33-12.htm" title="Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.">Psalm 33:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-4.htm" title="For the LORD has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.">Psalm 135:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/43-1.htm" title="But now thus said the LORD that created you, O Jacob, and he that formed you, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name; you are mine....">Isaiah 43:1-7</a>; &c.). Such “election” implies two things—(1) <span class="ital">selection out of others</span>, nations or men, who are not thus chosen—“the rest” (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>); and (2) <span class="ital">appropriation by God</span> for His own love and service. Since Israel as a people now rejected Christ, St Paul was compelled to distinguish between national Israel and the true “election,” the spiritual kernel of the chosen people, who were the real objects of God’s favour: “the election obtained what Israel seeks after, but the rest were hardened” (<a href="/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7</a>). With this true election, through Christ all believing Gentiles are identified—“wild olive shoots, grafted into the good olive-tree” (<a href="/context/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;...">Romans 11:17-24</a>). So the national gives place to a <span class="ital">spiritual election</span>—the “Israel of God” (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>); and the Apostle Paul applies the term, as in this place, to Jewish and Gentile members of the Church indiscriminately. This transference is strikingly expressed in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm" title="But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;">1 Peter 2:9</a> : “You (who believe in Christ) are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.” God’s election no longer marks out a nation or body of men as such, but it concerns <span class="ital">individuals</span>, each believer in Christ being the personal object of this loving choice—the “election of grace” (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm" title="Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.">Romans 11:5</a>). The <span class="ital">end</span> for which God in His grace so chooses men, appears in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, “God chose yon unto salvation,” i.e. final deliverance from death and all evil, to be brought about by the return of Christ from heaven (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>): the same end is set forth in the words of <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" title="For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,...">1 Thessalonians 5:9-10</a>—“God calleth you to His own kingdom and glory;” He “appointed you not to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him.” And the <span class="ital">means</span> toward this end are stated in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>,—“in sanctification of spirit and faith in the truth” (see note <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>). Similarly in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>, “He chose us to be holy and without blemish before Him.” In later Epistles (<a href="/context/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose....">Romans 8:28-30</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:...">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>) St Paul’s teaching on this subject receives two further extensions: (1) it is to <span class="ital">sonship</span> toward God that Christian believers are predestined; and (2) their election is carried back <span class="ital">to eternity</span>, “before the foundation of the world.” It is questionable whether “from the beginning” in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a> points back so far as this (see note <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>) The “election” of Thessalonian believers goes back at any rate as far as the Divine love of which they are the objects—“beloved by God.” But the Apostle’s mind is occupied with the event of the conversion of his readers, when God’s love to them and choice of them were practically manifest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God’s</span> choice of men for His purposes must, of course, precede <span class="ital">their</span> choice of Him and of His salvation; but it in no way precludes human choice and freedom of will—nay rather anticipates and prepares for our free volition (comp. <a href="/context/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose....">Romans 8:28-30</a>), and invites us to be “workers together” with it for our salvation: “work out your own salvation, … for it is God that worketh in you” (<a href="/context/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling....">Php 2:12-13</a>). It rests on the Divine <span class="ital">foreknowledge</span> of men (“whom He foreknew, He foreordained”), and seeks from their coming into life its destined objects (see <a href="/context/galatians/1-15.htm" title="But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,...">Galatians 1:15-16</a>). But “Prescience, as prescience, hath in itself no causing efficacy” (Hooker). Observe that Scripture does not speak of any <span class="ital">choice of men to believe in Christ</span>, but of <span class="ital">the choice of</span> (assumed) <span class="ital">believers to receive salvation</span>. The consistency of man’s free-will with God’s sovereignty forms an insoluble mystery, which does not belong to the doctrine of election alone, but runs through the whole of life and religion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle writes “<span class="ital">knowing</span> your election,” not that he is absolutely sure of the final salvation of every one to whom he writes—ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a> speaks otherwise; but from what he knows and remembers of them, he is practically certain that the circle of his readers belongs to God’s elect and that they will attain Christ’s heavenly kingdom (see ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" title="But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation....">1 Thessalonians 5:8-11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm" title="Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it.">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The evidence of this to his mind was twofold, lying (1) in <span class="ital">the power</span> given to himself and his companions in preaching at Thessalonica (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>), and (2) in <span class="ital">the zeal and devotion</span> with which the Thessalonians had embraced the gospel (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰδότες</span>, [we] <span class="ital">knowing</span>) Construed with <span class="ital">we give thanks</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοὶ ἠγαπήμενοι ὑπὸ Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">brethren beloved by God</span>) Comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκλογὴν</span>, <span class="ital">election</span>) <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, note.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span>; that is, not the Thessalonians themselves, but we, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; knowing, being well assured cf. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren beloved</span>, your election of God; or rather, as it is in the margin and in the R.V., <span class="accented">Knowing brethren, beloved of God, your election.</span> By election is meant that act of free grace by which God destines individuals to become believers in Christ.

The sense in this passage appears to be defined by the succeeding context. The Thessalonians had been chosen to be members of the Christian church, and their conduct had justified the choice.
