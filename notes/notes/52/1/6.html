The apostle mentions <span class="ital">Macedonia and Achaia, </span>because he had just been travelling through these parts before he came to Corinth, from whence, as has been observed in the preface, he wrote this epistle. <span class="ital">For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord </span>— Was echoed, as it were, from you; <span class="ital">not only in </span>your own borders of <span class="ital">Macedonia and Achaia </span>— With which you could easily have correspondence; <span class="ital">but also in every place </span>— That is, far beyond these countries; <span class="ital">your faith to God-ward</span> — The report of your embracing the gospel, and of consequence believing in the living and true God; <span class="ital">is spread abroad </span>— Is become notorious; <span class="ital">so that we need not to speak any thing </span>— Concerning it. The apostle does not mean that the Thessalonian brethren sent persons to preach the gospel in the countries here mentioned, but that their relinquishing idolatry had occasioned the preaching of the gospel at Thessalonica to be much talked of in these provinces, and in many other places. Grotius observes, that many of the Thessalonians being merchants, who travelled into foreign countries for the sake of commerce, the news of their fellow-citizens having renounced the worship of the heathen gods must have been spread abroad widely by their means, as the apostle here affirms. And as this was a very extraordinary event, it would naturally occasion much discourse among them to whom it was reported. <span class="ital">For they themselves </span>— The faithful, wherever we come; <span class="ital">show of us what manner of entering in, </span>&c. — Are able to give an account of the success of our ministry among you, and what entertainment it found with you; <span class="ital">and how ye turned to God from idols </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the worship of which ye had been brought up; <span class="ital">to serve the living and true God — </span>The epithet <span class="ital">living </span>is given to God to distinguish him from the heathen idols, which were destitute of life. And he is called the <span class="ital">true God, </span>in opposition to the fictitious deities worshipped by the heathens, who, though some of them may have formerly lived, or are now living, are not true gods; such as demons and the souls of men departed. <span class="ital">And to wait for his Son from heaven </span>— To raise the dead and judge the world; <span class="ital">whom he raised from the dead </span>— In proof of his future coming for these purposes. “Christ himself, on two different occasions, promised that he would return from heaven, <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>.

And as the great design of his return is to punish his enemies, and reward his faithful servants, his second coming was always a principal topic on which the apostles insisted in their discourses; consequently it was a principal article of the faith and hope of the first Christians, a frequent subject of their conversation, and a powerful source of consolation to them in all their afflictions and troubles. May it ever be the object of our faith and hope, and the source of our consolation, especially at death!” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Even Jesus, who delivered </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ρυομενον</span>, rather, <span class="ital">delivereth; us from the wrath to come </span>— He hath redeemed us once, he delivers us continually; and will deliver all that believe in him from the wrath, the eternal vengeance, which will then come upon the ungodly. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-10 When careless, ignorant, and immoral persons are turned from their carnal pursuits and connexions, to believe in and obey the Lord Jesus, to live soberly, righteously, and godly, the matter speaks for itself. The believers under the Old Testament waited for the coming of the Messiah, and believers now wait for his second coming. He is yet to come. And God had raised him from the dead, which is a full assurance unto all men that he will come to judgment. He came to purchase salvation, and will, when he comes again, bring salvation with him, full and final deliverance from that wrath which is yet to come. Let all, without delay, flee from the wrath to come, and seek refuge in Christ and his salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And ye became followers of us - "You became imitators - &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  mime&#772;tai - of us." This does not mean that they became followers of Paul, Silas, and Timothy, in the sense that they had set themselves up as teachers, or as the head of a sect, but that they imitated their manner of living; see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/4-16.htm">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>.<p>And of the Lord - The Lord Jesus. You also learned to imitate him. From this it is evident that the manner in which the Saviour lived was a prominent topic of their preaching, and also that it was one of the means of the conversion of the Thessalonians. It is probable that preaching on the pure and holy life of the Lord Jesus might be made a much more important means of the conversion of sinners than it is. Nothing is better adapted to show them the evil of their own guilty lives than the contrast between their lives and his; and nothing can be conceived better fitted to win them to holy living than the contemplation of his pure and holy deportment.<p>Having received the word in much affliction - That is, amidst much opposition from others; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-8</a>. It was in the midst of these trials that they had become converted - and they seem to have been all the better Christians for them. In this they were imitators of the Saviour, or shared the same lot with him, and thus became his followers. Their embracing and holding fast the truths of religion amidst all this opposition, showed that they were controlled by the same principles that he was, and that they were truly his friends.<p>With joy of the Holy Ghost - With happiness produced by the Holy Ghost. Though they were much afflicted and persecuted, yet there was joy. There was joy in their conversion - in the evidence of pardoned sin - in the hope of heaven; see the notes, <a href="/acts/8-8.htm">Acts 8:8</a>. However great may be the trials and persecutions experienced in receiving the gospel, or however numerous and long the sufferings of the subsequent life in consequence of having embraced it, there is a joy in religion that more than overbalances all, and that makes religion the richest of all blessings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

In reality, it is not to be distinguished from <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν ἐν κυρίῳ</span> (see Meyer on <a href="/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

In view of <a href="/context/psalms/51-13.htm" title="Then will I teach transgressors your ways; and sinners shall be converted to you....">Psalm 51:13-14</a> it is hardly correct to say, with Gunkel (<span class="ital">Wirkungen des heiligen Geistes</span>, 71), that this connection of joy and the Spirit was entirely foreign to Judaism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord</span>] <span class="bld">imitators of us</span> &c.

(2) How bold in the Apostle, and what a good conscience he kept, that he could identify following himself with following <span class="ital">Christ</span>.

Persecution marked out the path in which the Thessalonians were called to follow Christ, and gave them an immediate opportunity of showing the genuineness of their faith. So with the kindred Philippian Church: “To you it was granted as a favour on Christ’s behalf, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake” (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Php 1:29</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with joy of the Holy Ghost</span>] i.e. <span class="bld">coming of</span> (or <span class="ital">inspired by</span>) <span class="bld">the Holy Spirit</span>. Joy constantly attends suffering for the truth’s sake, and for the word of God. Of this St Paul was an eminent example—“sorrowing, yet alway rejoicing” (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-10.htm" title="As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>, &c.); and Christ Himself, Who promises His disciples “My joy” amidst the sorrows of His passion (<a href="/john/15-11.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.">John 15:11</a>); the Thessalonians were “imitators.” At a later time the Apostle notes in the Macedonian Churches, “in much proof of affliction, the abundance of their joy” (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>).
