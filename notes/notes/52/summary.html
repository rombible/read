This relentless enemy of Christians (Acts 8:3; 22:5, 19; 26:11; Gal. 1:13) would, following his conversion (Acts 9:3-9), become the greatest missionary, church planter, soul winner, and theologian in church history, authoring nearly half of the New Testament books! <p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What? The books of Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon.<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> When and where?

Of the six, only the church at Corinth and the one in Thessalonica were blessed with two inspired letters. <p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> The church at Thessalonica was founded by Paul during his second missionary journey. (See Acts 17:1-10.)<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> Paul spent at least three weeks in Thessalonica in the home of Jason (possibly a kinsman, see Rom. 16:21) organizing the church, working all the while as a tentmaker, that he might not be a burden to the believers. (See 1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess. 3:7-12.)<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> His visit there is short lived, for the gospel is opposed by some unbelieving Jews.

Carey in India, Judson in Burma, Morrison in China, and Moffat in Africa waited each seven years for his first convert.
