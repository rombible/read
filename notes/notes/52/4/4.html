that in this context, “a vessel,” or “instrument,” is an expressive and natural metaphor; that the word was familiar to Hebrew speakers in that sense (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Ahasuerus says of Vashti, in one of the Targums, “My vessel which I use is neither Median nor Persian, but Chaldee”); that St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>) uses the word of the wife. But it may be answered that this interpretation does not suit our context; first, because it would be laying an emphatic and binding veto upon celibacy, if “each one” is “to acquire a wife of his own;” secondly, because of the verb “to know,” it certainly being no part of a religious man’s duty “to <span class= "ital">know how</span> to procure a wife;” thirdly, because the Greek cannot be translated “<span class= "ital">a</span> vessel (or <span class= "ital">wife</span>) of his own,” but “<span class= "ital">his own</span> vessel” (or <span class= "ital">wife</span>)—literally, <span class= "ital">the vessel of himself</span>—and to speak of “procuring” the wife who is already one’s own seems unmeaning. Furthermore, although the quotations from the Targums are certainly to the point, that from St. Peter distinctly points the other way, inasmuch as the wife is called “the weaker vessel of the two,” evidently meaning that the husband is also “a vessel.” Thus we are driven to suppose that (2) the “vessel” is the man’s own self. This usage also is well supported. In <a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm" title="And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.">1Samuel 21:5</a>, it is used in precisely this sense, and in the same context, as well as in <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>. The passages, however, usually quoted in support of this interpretation from <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2Corinthians 4:7</a>, Philo, Barnabas, Lucretius, &c, do not seem quite parallel; for there the word signifies a “vessel,” in the sense of a receptacle for <span class= "ital">containing</span> something; here it is rather “an instrument” or “implement “for <span class= "ital">doing</span> something. Hence it approaches more nearly to the use in such phrases as <a href="/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>, “a vessel of choice,” or even (though the Greek word is different) to <a href="/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>. “The vessel of himself” (the “himself” being in the Greek strongly emphasised) means, not “the vessel which is his own,” but “the vessel or instrument which consists of himself.” Thus the body, which of course is chiefly meant here, is not dissociated from the man’s personality, as in the fanciful Platonism of Philo, but almost identified with it: the Incarnation has taught us the true dignity of the body. Thus it becomes easy to understand what is meant by “knowing how to gain possession of” such an instrument as the body with its many faculties, rescuing it from its vile prostitution, and wielding it wisely for its proper uses. So the same Greek verb is used, and mistranslated in our version, in <a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>, “In your patience possess ye your souls.”<p><span class= "bld">In sanctification and honour.</span>—The circumstances <span class= "ital">in</span> which—almost the means <span class= "ital">by</span> which—the man may acquire and keep this skilful power over his instrument:—“<span class= "ital">in a course</span> of self-purification and of self-reverence.” The reverence due to the instrument is brought out in a passage of St. Peter evidently modelled upon this (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm" title="Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.">1Peter 3:7</a>). (Comp. also <a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2Timothy 2:21</a>, “an instrument for honourable purposes, and to be honourably treated, consecrated, and handy for its owner’s use.”)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 To abide in the faith of the gospel is not enough, we must abound in the work of faith. The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel - The word "vessel" here (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  skeuos), probably refers to the body. When it is so used, it is either because the body is frail and feeble, like an earthen vessel, easily broken <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>, or because it is that which contains the soul, or in which the soul is lodged. Lucret. Lib. iii. 441. The word vessel also (Greek &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  skeuos) was used by the latter Hebrews to denote a wife, as the vessel of her husband. Schoettg. Hor. Heb. p. 827. Compare Wetstein in loc. Many, as Augustine, Wetstein, Schoettgen, Koppe, Robinson (Lex.), and others, have supposed that this is the reference here; compare <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>. The word body, however, accords more naturally with the usual signification of the word, and as the apostle was giving directions to the whole church, embracing both sexes, it is hardly probable that he confined his direction to those who had wives. It was the duty of females, and of the unmarried among the males, as well as of married men, to observe this command. The injunction then is, that we should preserve the body pure; see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>.<p>In sanctification and honour - Should not debase or pollute it; that is, that we should honor it as a noble work of God, to be employed for pure purposes; notes, <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. know&#8212;by moral self-control.<p>how to possess his vessel&#8212;rather as Greek, "how to acquire (get for himself) his own vessel," that is, that each should have his own wife so as to avoid fornication (1Th 4:3; 1Co 7:2).

By which may be meant, either a man's wife, or his body, and it is not very easy to determine which, for the Jews call both by this name. Sometimes they call (p) a woman  which the gloss says is a "vessel" unfinished. It is reported (q), that when R. Eleazar died, Rabbenu Hakkadosh would have married his widow, and she would not, because she was  , "a vessel of holiness", greater than he. Moreover, it is said (r), that <p>"he that forces (a young woman) must drink  "in his own vessel" how drink in his own vessel? though she be lame, though she be blind, and though she is stricken with ulcers.'' <p>The commentators (s) on the passage add, <p>"in the vessel which he has chosen; that is to say, whether he will or not, he must marry her;'' <p>see <a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15</a>. And again, they sometimes call a man's wife his tent: hence that saving (t), <p>"wtva ala wlha Nya "there is no tent but his wife", as it is said, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-30.htm">Deuteronomy 5:30</a>, go, say to them, get you into your tents again.'' <p>And certain it is, that the woman is called the "weaker vessel" in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, between which passage and this there seems to be some agreement. The same metaphor of a "vessel" is made use of in both; and as there, honour to be given to the weaker vessel, so here, a man's vessel is to be possessed in honour; and as there, husbands are to dwell with their wives according to knowledge so here, knowledge is required to a man's possessing his vessel aright. Now for a man to possess his vessel in this sense, is to enjoy his wife, and to use that power he has over her in a becoming manner; see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-4.htm">1 Corinthians 7:4</a>, and which is here directed to "in sanctification and honour"; that is, in a chaste and honourable way; for marriage is honourable when the bed is kept undefiled; and which may be defiled, not only by taking another into it, and which is not possessing the wife in sanctification and honour, it is the reverse, for it is a breaking through the rules of chastity and honour; but it may even be defiled with a man's own wife, by using her in an unnatural way, or by any unlawful copulation with her; for so to do is to use her in an unholy, unchaste, wicked, and dishonourable manner; whereas possessing of her according to the order and course of nature, is by the Jews, in agreement with the apostle, called (u), , "a man's sanctifying himself", and is chaste, and honourable. And it may be observed, that the Jews use the same phrase concerning conjugal embraces as the apostle does here. One of their canons runs thus (w): <p>"though a man's wife is free for him at all times, it is fit and proper for a disciple of a wise man to use himself  "in", or "to sanctification".'' <p>When these thing's are observed, this sense of the words will not appear so despicable as it is thought by some. The body is indeed called a "vessel"; see <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>, because in it the soul is contained, and the soul makes use of it, and its members, as instruments, for the performance of various actions; and, with Jewish writers, we read of , "the vessel of his body" (x); so then, for a man to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour, is to keep under his body and bring it into subjection, and preserve it in purity and chastity; as the eyes from unchaste looks, the tongue from unchaste words, and the other members from unchaste actions; and to use it in an honourable way, not in fornication, adultery, and sodomy; for, by fornication, a man sins against his own body; and by adultery he gets a wound, and a dishonour, and a reproach that will not be wiped away; and by sodomy, and such like unnatural lusts, men dishonour their own bodies between themselves: particularly by "his vessel", as Gataker thinks, may be meant the "membrum virile", or the genital parts, which, by an euphemism, may he so called; see <a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a><p>(p) T.

All the passages which are usually brought forward do not prove the contrary; <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Barnabas, <span class="ital">Ep.</span> vii. and xi.: <span class="greekheb">τὸ σκεῦος τοῦ πνεύματος</span> (<span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>), where <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> has its usual meaning, and only <span class="ital">the full expression</span> serves as a circumlocution for the body of Christ. Philo, <span class="ital">quod deter. pot. ins.</span> p. 186: <span class="greekheb">τὸ τῆς ψυχῆς ἀγγεῖον τὸ σῶμα</span>, and <span class="ital">de migr. Abrah.</span> p. 418: <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἀγγείοις τῆς ψυχῆς σώματι καὶ αἰσθήσει</span>. Cicero, <span class="ital">disput. Tusc.</span> i. 22: <span class="ital">corpus</span> quidem <span class="ital">quasi</span> vas est aut aliquod <span class="ital">animi</span> receptaculum. Lucretius, iii. 441: <span class="ital">corpus</span>, quod vas <span class="ital">quasi</span> constitit <span class="ital">ejus</span> (<span class="ital">sc.</span> animae). How different also from our passage is <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>, by the addition <span class="greekheb">ὀστρακίνοις</span>, according to which the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> is only <span class="ital">compared</span> with a <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος ὀστράκινον</span>! (3) The position of the words <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σκεῦος</span> is against it. For <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῦ</span> can only be placed first, because the emphasis rests on it; but a reference to the <span class="ital">body</span> of an individual cannot be emphatic; it would require to be written <span class="greekheb">τὸ σκεῦος ἑαυτοῦ</span>. Olshausen certainly finds in <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῦ</span> a <span class="ital">support</span> for the opposite view; but how arbitrary is his assertion, that by the genitive “the subjectivity, the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span>, is distinguished from the <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span>,” as only the <span class="ital">belonging</span>, the <span class="ital">private possession</span>, can be designated by <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῦ</span>! (4) The context also does not lead us to understand <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> of the body. Paul, namely, has brought forward the <span class="greekheb">ἁγιασμός</span> of his readers as the will of God, and has further explained this <span class="greekheb">ἁγιασμός</span>, first, <span class="ital">negatively</span> as an <span class="ital">abstinence from fornication</span>. If, now, this <span class="ital">negative</span> specification is still further explained by a <span class="ital">positive</span> one, this further <span class="ital">positive</span> addition can only contain the reverse, that is, the requirement <span class="ital">to satisfy the sexual impulse in chastity and honour</span>. The words import this, if <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> is understood in its original meaning, “<span class="ital">retain a vessel</span>,” and the expression as a <span class="ital">figurative</span> designation of <span class="ital">wife</span>. So, in essentials, Theodore Mopsuestius (ed. Fritzsche, p. 145: <span class="greekheb">Σκεῦος τὴν ἰδίαν ἑκάστου γαμετὴν ὀνομάζει</span>); <span class="greekheb">τίνες</span> in Theodoret (<span class="greekheb">τὴν ὁμόζυγα</span>); Augustin, <span class="ital">contra Julian</span>, iv. 10, v. 9; <span class="ital">de nupt. et concup</span>. i. 8; Thomas Aquinas, Zwingli, Estius, Balduin, Heinsius, Seb. Schmid, Wetstein, Schoettgen, Michaelis, Koppe, Schott, de Wette, Koch, Bisping, Ewald, Alford, Hofmann, Riggenbach, and others. How suitably does the emphatic <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτοῦ</span> become through this interpretation, the apostle, in contrast to the <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span>, the <span class="ital">Venus vulgivaga</span>, urging that every one should acquire his own vessel or means to appease the sexual impulse—that is, should enter into marriage, ordained by God for the regulation of fleshly lusts; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>, where the same principle is expressed. To regard the expression <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> as a figurative designation of wife is the less objectionable, as this figurative designation is besides supported by Jewish usage. Thus it is said in <span class="ital">Megilla Esther</span>, i. 11: In convivio illius impii aliqui dixerunt: mulieres Medicae sunt pulchriores, alii vero: Persicae sunt pulchriores.

Paul demands chastity from men; it is not simply a feminine virtue. Contemporary ethics, in the Roman and Greek world, was often disposed to condone marital unfaithfulness on the part of husbands, and to view prenuptial unchastity as <span class="greekheb">ἀδιάφορον</span> or at least as a comparatively venial offence, particularly in men (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Lecky’s <span class="ital">History of European Morals</span>, i. 104 f., ii. 314 f.). The strict purity of Christ’s gospel had to be learnt (<span class="greekheb">εἰδέναι</span>).—<span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> (lit. “vessel”) = “wife;” the rendering “body” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Barn. vii. 3) conflicts with the normal meaning of <span class="greekheb">κτᾶσθαι</span> (“get,” “acquire;” of marriage, LXX. <a href="/ruth/4-10.htm" title="Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.">Ruth 4:10</a>; Sir. 36:29, Xen., <span class="ital">Symp.</span>, ii. 10). Paul views marriage on much the same level as he does in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>; in its chaste and religious form, it is a remedy against sensual passion, not a gratification of that passion.

The two latter words tend to raise the current estimate, presupposed here and in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>, of a wife as the <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span> of her husband; this in its turn views adultery primarily as an infringement of the husband’s rights or an attack on his personal property. Paul, however, closes by an emphatic word on the religious aspect (<a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified....">1 Thessalonians 4:6-8</a>) of the question; besides, as Dr. Drummond remarks, “is it not part of his greatness that, in spite of his own somewhat ascetic temperament, he was not blind to social and physiological facts?” It is noticeable that his eschatology has less effect on his view of marriage here than in 1 Corinthians 7. Even were <span class="greekheb">κτᾶσθαι</span> taken as = “possess,” a usage not quite impossible for later Greek (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Field, 72), it would only extend the idea to the duties of a Christian husband. The alternative rendering (“acquire mastery of,” <a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>) does not justify the “body” sense of <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel</span> (R.

The “vessel” we take to be <span class="ital">the body</span>, regarded as the vehicle and instrument of the inner self—“the vessel of himself.” What the tool is to the hand, or vase to the essence it holds, that the body is to the man’s self. Comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm" title="But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>, “this treasure in earthen vessels”; similarly in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens....">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a> the body is “the earthly <span class="ital">house</span> of our tabernacle,” the <span class="ital">clothing</span> without which we should be “found naked.” The victim of sensual passion ceases to be master of his own person—he is <span class="ital">possessed</span>; and those who formerly lived in heathen uncleanness, had now as Christians to <span class="ital">possess themselves</span> of their bodies, to “win” the “vessel” of their spiritual life and make it truly their own, and a fit receptacle for the redeemed and sanctified self (comp. <a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>, “In your patience ye shall <span class="ital">win</span> your souls,” R. V.,—the same Greek verb). This they must “know how” (i.e. <span class="ital">have skill</span>) to do—a skill for which there was continual need. The Greek expression for Temperance—<span class="ital">enkrateia</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">continence, self-control</span>—expresses a similar thought; so the simile of <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, “I buffet my body, and make it my slave.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in sanctification</span>] For it was under this idea, and within the sphere of the new, consecrated life that such mastery of the body was to be gained (see notes on <span class="ital"><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a></span>).

Especially two meanings have been given to it. By some it is supposed to be a figurative expression for "wife," in which sense the word is used, though rarely, by Hebrew writers. Peter speaks of the wife "as the weaker vessel" (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). This is the meaning adopted by Augustine, Schott, Do Wette, Koch, Hofmann, L&uuml;nemann, Riggenbach; and, among English expositors, by Alford, Jowett, Ellicott, and Eadie. This meaning is, however, to be rejected as unusual and strange, and unsuitable to what follows in the next verse. The other meaning - "one's own body" - is more appropriate. Thus Paul says, "We have this treasure," namely, the gospel, "in earthen vessels" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>). The body may well be compared to a vessel, as it contains the soul. This meaning is adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Grotius, Bengel, Olshausen, Meyer; and, among English expositors, by Macknight, Conybeare, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Yaughan. <span class="cmt_word">In sanctification and honor.</span> What the apostle here requires is that every one should obtain the mastery over his own body, and that whereas, as Gentiles, they had yielded their members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, they should now, as Christians, yield their members servants to righteousness unto holiness (<a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel, etc. (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The interpretation of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-6</a> usually varies between two explanations: 1. making the whole passage refer to fornication and adultery: 2. limiting this reference to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>, and making <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a> refer to honesty in business. Both are wrong. The entire passage exhibits two groups of parallel clauses; the one concerning sexual, and the other business relations. Thus: 1. Abstain from fornication: deal honorably with your wives. 2. Pursue your business as holy men, not with covetous greed as the heathen: do not overreach or defraud.

Here, metaphorically, for wife; comp. <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>. It was used for wife in the coarse and literal sense by Rabbinical writers. The admonition aptly follows the charge to abstain from fornication. On the contrary, let each one treat honorably his own wife. The common interpretation is, "as a safeguard against fornication let every one know how to procure his own wife." It is quite safe to say that such a sentence could never have proceeded from Paul. He never would have offset a charge to abstain from fornication with a counsel to be well informed in the way of obtaining a wife. When he does touch this subject, as he does in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>, he says, very simply, "to avoid fornication let every man have (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;) his own wife"; not, know how to get one. &#x395;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; know, as usually interpreted, is both superfluous and absurd. Besides, the question was not of procuring a wife, but of living honorably and decently with her, paying her the respect which was her right, and therefore avoiding illicit connections.<p>That he pursue his gain-getting in sanctification and honor (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)<p>As a holy and honorable man. The exhortation now turns to business relations. &#x39a;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; cannot mean possess, as A.V. That would require the perfect tense. It means procure, acquire.
