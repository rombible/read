The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness - When he called us to be his followers, it was not that we should lead lives of impurity, but of holiness.

The first is taken from their Christian calling, which is <span class="bld">not to uncleanness, but to</span> chastity, called <span class="bld">holiness.</span> When they were Gentiles in state, they lived in the lust of uncleanness, but they were now called by the power of the gospel, and brought to such a profession that did forbid and condemn it. And the author of their call is <span class="bld">God</span> himself, though the apostles and other ministers were the instruments. Whence he fetcheth this second argument, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a></span>, that if this chastity he despised, or rejected, as we may read the text, it is not man, but God, that is despised.

Or, that the apostle was despised by some because of the outward meanness of his person, or questioning his authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit:</span> this he adds as a third argument; so that what he had preached to them, was not from himself, but from the Holy Spirit. Or if by <span class="bld">us</span> he means these Thessalonians also, as some copies read it, he hath given you, &c., then he argues from the gift of the Holy Spirit they had received against living in the sin of uncleanness. This would be very disagreeable, not only to their holy calling, but the Holy Spirit God had given them. Or else these arguments of the apostle are to persuade to universal holiness, taking sanctification and holiness in a larger sense; and uncleanness, for all sin in general standing opposite thereunto. Sin is often spoken of in Scripture under the notion of filth, defilement, pollution, &c., and so was typed forth under the law; and to be cleansed from sin is a cleansing man from filthiness, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2 Corinthians 7:1</a></span>; so that to live in sin, as the apostle argues, is to live in uncleanness, to contradict our holy calling, to despise God, and to walk contrary to the nature and dictates of his Holy Spirit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For God hath not called us,....

Certainly He never intended them to live impure lives, when He “called them to His own kingdom and glory” (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>); the understanding on which that call was received was the opposite of this.

True believers in Christ are necessarily “saints;” so the Apostle commonly addresses all Christians to whom he writes (see <a href="/romans/1-7.htm" title="To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 1:7</a>, &c.—“called saints,” i.e. “saints in virtue of your calling”); and their sainthood excludes impurity and wrong-doing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe that <span class="ital">God’s call</span> is the starting-point of a Christian’s life.
