The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not in the lust of concupiscence - In gross gratifications.<p>Even as the Gentiles - This was, and is, a common vice among the pagan; see the <a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a> note; <a href="/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a> note; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm">Ephesians 4:17-18</a> notes, and the reports of missionaries everywhere.<p>Which know not God - See the <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>, <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a> notes; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. in the lust&#8212;Greek, "passion"; which implies that such a one is unconsciously the passive slave of lust.<p>which know not God&#8212;and so know no better.

But these Thessalonians now, since their conversion by the gospel, were come to this knowledge of God, which they had not before, and therefore were not to live as before they did.
