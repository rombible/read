therefore, the words as far as “trump of God” are logically <span class= "ital">parenthetical; </span>and the proof only begins at “<span class= "ital">They</span> shall rise <span class= "ital">first: then</span> we shall be caught up.”<p><span class= "bld">With a shout.</span>—The Greek word means a <span class= "ital">shout of</span> <span class= "ital">command or encouragement, </span>such as a captain gives to his soldiers, or a boatswain to his crew. It is not necessary to inquire <span class= "ital">what</span> the command may be, or <span class= "ital">to whom</span> issued, inasmuch as the word does not always imply any particular <span class= "ital">orders;</span> nor <span class= "ital">who</span> is represented as uttering it: the intention is only to convey the notion of the stirring noise, in the midst of which (for the original has “in,” not “with”) the Lord will descend. It is, however, somewhat particularised by what follows: two notes amid those sounds of mystery strike the ear—the archangel’s voice, and the trump of God. Probably, therefore, the “shout of command” is uttered by the “leader of the angels;” and the trump (called “the trump of God” because used for God’s purposes) is blown to summon the mustering hosts. In favour of supposing the Lord Himself to utter the cry, may be adduced <a href="/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>; but, on the other hand, it suits the dignity of the scene better to imagine the loud sound to come rather from one of the heralds of the great army. The preposition “in” is more effective than “with:” it calls attention to the <span class= "ital">long</span> blast. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/19-19.htm" title="And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.">Exodus 19:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Shall rise first.</span>—Not as meaning “shall be the first to rise,” as contrasted with non-members of the Church who are to rise later; though that is a scriptural thought (<a href="/context/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5-6</a>), the Greek here refuses to be so explained. Rather, “the first thing will be the rising of the dead in Christ,” contrasted with what follows—“<span class= "ital">then, </span>and not till then, shall we be caught up.” The same order is carefully observed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1Corinthians 15:52</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:...">1 Thessalonians 4:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord himself </span>— The Lord Christ, arrayed in all his own glory, and in that of his Father; <span class="ital">shall descend from heaven </span>— “This expression does not imply that the Lord Jesus will fix his tribunal on the earth; but that he will descend so as to fix his seat in the air, at such distance from the earth that every eye shall see him, and every ear shall hear his voice, when he passes the awful sentence by which their state shall be unchangeably fixed. This conjecture is confirmed by <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>, where we are told that, after the judgment, the righteous <span class="ital">shall be caught up in clouds to join the Lord in the air.” </span>— Macknight. <span class="ital">With a shout — </span>Raised by millions of happy attendant spirits. The word <span class="greekheb">κελευσματι</span>, so rendered, denotes the shout which the soldiers of an army used to make at their first onset to encourage one another in the attack; it is therefore used with great propriety to express the loud acclamation which the whole angelical hosts will utter to express their joy at the coming of Christ to raise the dead and judge the world. <span class="ital">The voice of the, </span>or rather, (as the article is wanting in the original,) <span class="ital">an archangel </span>— He, probably, who will preside over that innumerable company of angels who are to attend Christ when he comes to judge the world. <span class="ital">And the trump of God </span>— Sounding, doubtless, with more loud and terrible blasts than those uttered on mount Sinai when the law was given. Perhaps the voice of God himself is meant, or a great and terrible sound made by attendant angels, analogous to that of a trumpet. This circumstance is mentioned likewise <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>, where see the note. And as Theodoret remarks, If the loud sound of the trumpet, when the law was given from mount Sinia, especially when it sounded long, and waxed continually louder and louder, was so dreadful to the Israelites, that they said to Moses, <span class="ital">Let not the Lord speak to us lest we die; </span>how terrible must the sound of this trumpet be, which calls all men to that final judgment that will determine their lot for ever! <span class="ital">And the dead in Christ</span> — Those that had departed this life in a state of union with, and conformity to him; who had received his Spirit in its various graces, and imitated his example; <span class="ital">shall rise first </span>— Shall spring forth out of their graves in forms of glory, to the infinite astonishment of the surviving world, before the rest of the dead are raised, or the living saints are changed. <span class="ital">Then we who are alive</span> — Those in Christ who are found living at his coming; <span class="ital">shall be caught up</span> — That is, after their bodies are changed and rendered glorious and immortal; <span class="ital">together with them </span>— Namely, with the saints now raised, while the wicked remain beneath. What is intended by the expression <span class="ital">caught up, </span>Dr. Scott (<span class="ital">Christ. Life, </span>vol. 3. pp. 1, 204) thinks shall be effected by the activity of the glorified bodies of the righteous. But this opinion does not seem consistent with the original word, <span class="greekheb">αρπαγησομεθα</span>, here used, which implies the application of an external force. Doubtless they shall be caught up by a mighty and instantaneous operation of the divine power; <span class="ital">to meet the Lord in the </span>region of the <span class="ital">air </span>— Where his throne shall then be erected; and there, having been openly acknowledged and acquitted by him, they shall be assessors with him in that judgment to which wicked men and angels are there to be brought forth; and when the final sentence is passed upon them, shall accompany their re-ascending Saviour. <span class="ital">And so shall we ever be with the Lord </span>— Where we shall spend a blissful eternity ill the sight and participation of his glory. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— Make these grand events the subject of your frequent meditation; and when your hearts are distressed with grief for the loss of your pious friends, or on any other occasion which can arise in this mortal life; <span class="ital">comfort one another with these words </span>— The tenor of which is so important, and the truth contained in them so certain, as being taught by the infallible dictates of the Spirit of God, and revealed to us by him, from whose fidelity, power, and grace, we expect this complete salvation. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven - notes, <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.<p>With a shout - The word here used (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  keleusma), does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It properly means a "cry' of excitement, or of arging on; an outcry, clamor, or shout, as of sailors at the oar, Luc. Catapl. 19; of soldiers rushing to battle, Thuc. 3:14; of a multitude of people, Diod. Sic. 3:15; of a huntsman to his dogs, Xen. Ven. 6:20. It does not mean here, that the Lord would himself make such a shout, but that he would be attended with it; that is, with a multitude who would lift up the voice like that of an army rushing to the conflict.<p>With the voice of the archangel - The word archangel occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in Jde 1:9, where it is applied to Michael. It properly means a chief angel; one who is first, or who is over others - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  archo&#772;n. The word is not found in the Septuagint, and the only archangel, therefore, which is named in the Scriptures, is Michael; Jde 1:9; compare <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>. Seven angels, however, are referred to in the Scriptures as having an eminence above others, and these are commonly regarded as archangels. <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/8-2.htm">Revelation 8:2</a>, "and I saw the seven angels which stood before God." One of these is supposed to be referred to in the Book of Tobit, 12:15, "I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." The names of three only of the seven are mentioned in the Jewish writings: Michael, the patron of the Jewish nation, <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, <a href="/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>.<p>Gabriel, <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>, <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>. Raphael, Tobit 3:17; 5:4; 8:2; 9:1, 5; 12:15. The Book of Enoch adds that of Uriel, pp. 187, 190, 191, 193. Michael is mentioned as one "of the chief princes," <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>; and as "the great prince," <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>; compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, and see an article by Prof. Stuart in the Bibliotheca Sacra. No. 1, on Angelology. It seems evident from the Scriptures, that there is one or more among the angels to whom the name archangel properly belongs. This view is in accordance with the doctrine in the Scriptures that the heavenly beings are divided into ranks and orders, for if so, it is not unreasonable to suppose that there should be one or more to whom the most exalted rank pertains; compare <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>. Whether there is more than one to whom this name appropriately belongs, it is impossible now to determine, and is not material. The word here (in Greek) is without the article, and the phrase might be rendered, "with the voice of an archangel."<p>The Syriac renders it, "with the voice of the prince of the angels." On an occasion so august and momentous as that of the coming of the final Judge of all mankind; the resurrection of the dead, and the solemn transactions before the tribunal of the Son of God deciding the destiny of countless million for ever, it will not be inappropriate that the highest among the heavenly hosts should be present and take an important part in the solemnities of the day. It is not quite certain what is meant here by "the voice of the archangel," or for what purpose that voice will be heard. It cannot be that it will be to raise the dead - for that will be by the "voice of the Son of God" <a href="//biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>, and it seems most probable that the meaning is, that this will be a part of the loud shout or cry which will be made by the descending hosts of heaven; or perhaps it may be for the purpose of summoning the world to the bar of judgment; compare <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>.<p>And with the trump of God - The trump which God appoints to be sounded on that solemn occasion. It does not mean that it will be sounded by God himself; see the notes on <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>.<p>And the dead in Christ - Christians.<p>Shall rise first - That is, before the living shall be changed. A doctrine similar to this was held by the Jews. "Resch Lachisch said, Those who die in the land of Israel shall rise first in the days of the Messiah." See Wetstein, in loc. It is implied in all this description, that the interval between their resurrection and the change which will occur to the living, will be brief, or that the one will rapidly succeed the other compare notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. himself&#8212;in all the Majesty of His presence in person, not by deputy.<p>descend&#8212;even as He ascended (Ac 1:11).<p>with&#8212;Greek, "in," implying one concomitant circumstance attending His appearing.<p>shout&#8212;Greek, "signal shout," "war shout."

That reference occurs elsewhere (Mt 13:41, 42, 50; Joh 5:29; 1Co 15:23, 24; Re 20:5, 6); it simply stands in opposition to "then," 1Th 4:17. FIRST, "the dead in Christ" shall rise, THEN the living shall be caught up.

Not by proxy, or by representatives; not by the ministry of angels, as on Mount Sinai; nor by the ministers of the word, as under the Gospel dispensation; nor by his spirit, and the discovery of his love and grace, in which sense he descends in a spiritual manner, and visits his people; but in person, in his human nature, in soul and body; in like manner as he went up to heaven will he descend from thence, so as to be visible, to be seen and heard of all: he will come down from the third heaven, whither he was carried up, into which he was received, and where he is retained until the time of the restitution of all things, and from whence the saints expect him: and this descent will be <p>with a shout; the word here used is observed by many to signify such a noise or shout as is made either by mariners, when they pull and row together; and shout to direct and encourage one another; or to an army with the general at the head of it, when about to undertake some considerable action, to enter on a battle, and make the onset; Christ will now appear as the King of kings, and Lord of lords, as the Judge of the whole earth, attended with the host, or armies of heaven, and the shout of a king will be among them: perhaps the same is intended, as by the voice of a great multitude, as the voice of many waters, and of mighty thunderings upon the coming of Christ, the destruction of antichrist, and the marriage of the Lamb, in <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a>. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions render it, "in", or "with command"; and the Arabic version, "with his own government", or "authority"; that is, he shall descend, either by the command of his Father, as man and Mediator, having authority from him, as the son of man, to execute judgment; or with his commanding power and authority over the mighty angels, that shall descend with him: it follows, <p>with the voice of the archangel; so Michael is called, in Jde 1:9 with which compare <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and who perhaps is no other than Christ himself, who is the head of all principality and power; and the sense be, that Christ shall descend from heaven with a voice, or shall then utter such a voice, as will show him to be the archangel; or as the Syriac version renders it, "the head", or "prince of angels"; and which whether, it will be an articulate voice, such as was expressed at the grave of Lazarus; or a violent clap of thunder, which is the voice of God; or the exertion of the power of Christ, is not certain: it is added, <p>and with the trump of God; called "the last trump", <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a> because none will be blown after it, and may be the same with the seventh trumpet, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a> and here the trump of God, because blown by his order; or by Christ himself, who is God, and so be the same with the voice of the archangel; and these figurative expressions are used, to set forth the grandeur and magnificence in which Christ will come; not in that low, mean, and humble form in which he first came, but with great glory, and marks of honour and respect; with angels shouting, trumpets blowing, and saints rejoicing. This is said in allusion to the trumpet which was heard on Mount Sinai at the giving of the law, and of which the Jews say (d), that it  "quickened the dead"; for they have a notion, that, when the Israelites first heard the voice of the Lord, they died; but upon hearing it the second time, they returned to life (e): and they suppose also in the time, to come, at the resurrection of the dead, a trumpet will be blown, which will quicken the dead (f), and the day of judgment (g); and this is reckoned by them as one of the signs of the Messiah's coming (h): <p>"Michael shall shout with a great shout, and the graves of the dead shall be opened at Jerusalem, and the holy blessed God will restore the dead to life, and Messiah the son of David shall come,'' &amp;c. <p>And the dead in Christ shall rise first; the same with those that are asleep in Jesus, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a> not only the martyrs that died for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel; nor merely those who die in the lively exercise of faith in Christ; but all that die interested in him, and in union with him: and these shall "rise", in consequence of their being his; being given to him, made his care and charge, and engaged for by him, and in virtue of their union to him; and shall rise to an entire conformity to his glorious body, and in order to enjoy eternal life and glory with him: and these will rise "first", before the wicked, which is the first resurrection, <a href="/revelation/20-5.htm">Revelation 20:5</a> even a thousand years before them; the righteous will rise in the morning of the resurrection, and so will have the dominion in the morning, <a href="/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a> even at the beginning of the thousand years, as soon as Christ will come; but the wicked will not rise till the evening of that day, or till the close of the thousand years: and this agrees with the notions of the Jews, who thought that some will rise before others; <p>"Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection.'' (2 Esdras 2:23) <p>Having mentioned those words in <a href="/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a> "I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living", it is asked (i), <p>"is there no land of the living but Tyre and its neighbours, and Caesarea, and its neighbours, where is cheapness and fulness? says R. Simeon ben Lekish, in the name of Bar Kaphra, the land in which the dead live,  "first", in the days of the Messiah:'' <p>and on the same place elsewhere (k) they observe, that <p>"our Rabbins say two things, or give two reasons, why the fathers loved to be buried in the land of Israel, because the dead in the land of Israel , "live", or "rise first", in the days of the Messiah, and shall enjoy the years of the Messiah:'' <p>and in another place (l) they take notice of what is written in <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a> "and the earth shall cast out the dead": says R. Jochanan, <p>"the dead which are in the land (i.e. of Israel), they shall "live first"; as it is said, "thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise": these are they that are without the land; "awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust", these are they that die in the wilderness:'' <p>and again (m), <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</span><p>(h) The word which the apostle uses here, properly signifies that encouragement which mariners give to one another, when they altogether with one shout put forth their oars and row together.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>.

Thucyd. ii. 92; Xen. <span class="ital">de venat.</span> vi. 20; Lucian, <span class="ital">Catapl.</span> 19. Here the <span class="greekheb">κέλευσμα</span> might be referred to God. Only then we must not, as Hunnius does, identify it with the <span class="greekheb">σάλπιγξ Θεοῦ</span>, and find represented in the two expressions the “horribilis fragor inclarescentium tonitruum;” but, in conjunction with the statement that God only knows beforehand the time and hour of the advent (<a href="/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>), it must refer to the imperative call to bring about the advent. So recently Bisping. This interpretation is, however, to be rejected, because the three sentences introduced with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> are evidently similar, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> all three are a statement of the mode of <span class="greekheb">καταβαίνειν</span>, accordingly contain the description of the circumstances with which the descent during the course of its completion will be accompanied. But, understood in the above manner, <span class="greekheb">ἐν κελεύσματι</span> would denote an act <span class="ital">preceding</span> the <span class="greekheb">καταβαίνειν</span>, and thus another preposition instead of <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> would necessarily be chosen. Others, as Theodoret, Oecumenius, Grotius, and Olshausen, refer <span class="greekheb">ἐν κελεύσματι</span> to Christ. But in this case we would be puzzled so to define the <span class="ital">contents</span> of the <span class="greekheb">κέλευσμα</span>, as to prevent them coming into collision with the <span class="greekheb">φωνεῖν</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχάγγελος</span>. For that we are not justified, with Theodoret, in distinguishing the <span class="greekheb">κέλευσμα</span> and the <span class="greekheb">φωνή</span> by a <span class="ital">prius</span> and <span class="ital">post</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος</span> … <span class="greekheb">κελεύσει μὲν ἀρχάγγελον βοῆσαι</span>) is evident, as both are simultaneous—both in a similar manner are represented as accompanying the <span class="greekheb">καταβαίνειν</span>. It is accordingly most probable that Paul places <span class="greekheb">ἐν κελεύσματι</span> first as a primary, and on that account absolute expression, and then, in an epexegetical manner, more fully developes it by <span class="greekheb">ἐν φωνῇ ἀρχαγγέλου καὶ ἐν σάλπιγγι Θεοῦ</span>. If this is the correct interpretation, the apostle considers the <span class="greekheb">κέλευσμα</span> as given by the archangel,[59] directly afterwards mentioned, who for the publication of it uses partly his voice and partly a trumpet; and, as the <span class="ital">contents</span> of the <span class="greekheb">κέλευσμα</span>, the imperative call which reaches the sleeping Christians to summon them from their graves (comp. also the following <span class="greekheb">καὶ οἱ νεκροὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), consequently the <span class="ital">resurrection-call</span> (Theodoret, John Damascenus, Calixt, and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν φωνῇ ἀρχαγγέλου καὶ ἐν σάλπιγγι Θεοῦ</span>] <span class="ital">with the call, namely, of an archangel, and with</span> (the sound) <span class="ital">of the trumpet of God</span>.

According to the post-exile Jewish notion, the angels were distinguished into different orders and classes, over each of which presided an <span class="greekheb">ἀρχάγγελος</span>. (See Winer’s <span class="ital">bibl. Realwörterb.</span> 2d ed. vol. I. p. 386 f.) One of these <span class="greekheb">ἀρχάγγελοι</span> (<span class="greekheb">שָׂרִים</span>)—whom Nicolas de Lyra, Hunnius, Estius (appealing to <a href="/judges/1-9.htm" title="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Judges 1:9</a> and Revelation 12), Bern, a Picon., Bisping suppose to be the archangel Michael; and Cornelius a Lapide, Michael or Gabriel; whilst Ambrosiaster and Olshausen, as well as Alphen and Honert (in Wolf), understand no angel at all, but the two first understand Christ (!), and the two last the Holy Ghost (!)—is considered as the <span class="ital">herald</span> at the commencement of the advent, who with a loud voice calls upon the dead, and arouses them by the sound of a trumpet. The Jews used trumpets for summoning the people together; comp. <a href="/numbers/10-2.htm" title="Make you two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shall you make them: that you may use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.">Numbers 10:2</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-6.htm" title="And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.">Numbers 31:6</a>, <a href="/joel/2-1.htm" title="Blow you the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD comes, for it is near at hand;">Joel 2:1</a>. Also the manifestations of God were considered as accompanied by the sound of a trumpet; comp. <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/47-6.htm" title="Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing praises.">Psalm 47:6</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-14.htm" title="And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.">Zechariah 9:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.">Isaiah 27:13</a>;—and as it was the opinion of the later Jews that God will use a powerful and far-sounding trumpet to raise the dead (comp. Eisenmenger’s <span class="ital">entdecktes Judenthum</span>, II. p. 929 f.), so in the N. T. mention is made of a <span class="greekheb">σάλπιγξ</span> in reference to Christ’s advent; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm" title="And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.">Matthew 24:31</a>. The trumpet is called <span class="greekheb">σάλπιγξ Θεοῦ</span>, either because it excels all human or earthly trumpets in the power of its sound (so Cornelius a Lapide, Calov, Wolf, Benson, Bengel, Baumgarten, Bolten, and several); or because it will be blown at the command of God (so Balduin, Jac. Laurentius, Pelt, Schott, Olshausen, and others); or, lastly, because it belongs to God and is used in His service (so de Wette, who refers to the expression “harps of God,” <a href="/1_chronicles/16-42.htm" title="And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God.

For if connected with <span class="greekheb">ἀναστήσονται</span>, then <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span> would receive an emphasis which, according to the context, it cannot have; as the apostle does not intend to bring forward the person <span class="ital">by whom</span> the resurrection is effected, which is evident of itself, but designs to show what relation it will have to those who sleep on the one hand, and to those who are alive on the other.

(<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="ital">DC</span>[33], ii. 766). The archangel is Michael, who in Jewish tradition not only summoned the angels but sounded a trumpet to herald God’s approach for judgment (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in <span class="ital">Apoc.

With such scenic and realistic details, drawn from the heterogeneous eschatology of the later Judaism, Paul seeks to make intelligible to his own mind and to that of his readers, in quite an original fashion (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Stähelin, <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. deut. Theol.</span>, 1874, pp. 199–218), the profound truth that neither death nor any cosmic, crisis in the future will make any essential difference to the close relation between the Christian and his Lord. <span class="greekheb">Οὕτω πάντοτε σὺν κυρίῳ ἐσόμεθα</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.">Php 1:20</a>): this is all that remains to us, in our truer view of the universe, from the naïve <span class="greekheb">λόγος κυρίου</span> of the apostle, but it is everything.

This verse, like the above passages of the Apocalypse, echoes the words of Christ in <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm" title="And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.">Matthew 24:31</a> : “He shall send forth His angels with a trumpet of great voice.” In <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1 Corinthians 15:52</a> the whole is described in one word: “The-<span class="ital">trumpet</span>-shall-sound, and the dead shall be raised.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the <span class="ital">military</span> trumpet, like “word of command” above, by which the Lord of Hosts musters and marshals His array.

This is the earliest example of the title <span class="ital">archangel</span>. In Judges 9 we read of “<span class="ital">Michael</span> the archangel”—an expression probably based on <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm" title="And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.">Daniel 12:1</a>, “Michael the great prince” (LXX: “the great angel;” comp. <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm" title="And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,">Revelation 12:7</a>, where “Michael and his angels” are arrayed against “the Dragon and his angels”). Of equal rank with Michael is <span class="ital">Gabriel</span>, the angel of comfort and good tidings in <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm" title="And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.">Daniel 8:16</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm" title="Yes, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.">Daniel 9:21</a>, and <a href="/luke/1-19.htm" title="And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to you, and to show you these glad tidings.">Luke 1:19</a>; <a href="/luke/1-26.htm" title="And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,">Luke 1:26</a>. The military style of this passage suits rather the character of Michael. Amongst the seven chief angels recognised at this time in Jewish teaching, <span class="ital">Raphael</span> stood nearest to the two that appear in the New Testament (<a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-15.htm" title="I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.">Tob 12:15</a>). St Paul probably ranged the Archangels amongst the Principalities (Greek <span class="ital">Archai</span>) to which he refers in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a> (<span class="ital">angels and principalities</span>), <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>.

Others strangely imagine that the Holy Ghost is here meant. Others fix on the archangel Michael (<a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>).

"We are to recognize three particulars, following each other in rapid succession - the commanding shout of the King himself, the voice of the archangel summoning the other angels, and the trump of God which awakens the dead and collects believers" (Riggen-bach). <span class="cmt_word">And the dead in Christ shall rise first.</span> Some suppose that the reference here is to the first resurrection; that the righteous, "the dead in Christ," shall rise before the wicked, "the dead not in Christ;" and that a thousand years, or the millennium, will intervene between the first and second resurrections (<a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4, 5</a>). But this is an entirely erroneous supposition. All that is here asserted is that the dead in Christ shall rise before the living in Christ shall be changed; there is no contrast between the dead in Christ and the dead not in Christ, nor any allusion to the resurrection of the wicked. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The word of the Lord<p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>, is apparently not intended to include the specific details which follow.
