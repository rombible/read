It does not mean “According to certain words which Christ spoke,” nor yet “<span class= "ital">By means</span> of a revelation from the Lord to me,” but “<span class= "ital">By way of</span> a divine revelation:” “I tell you this as a message straight from God.” In what way apostles and prophets became <span class= "ital">conscious</span> of supernatural inspiration we cannot tell; but elsewhere also St. Paul speaks of possessing the consciousness sometimes and not at others. (See <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1Corinthians 7:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm" title="But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.">1Corinthians 7:40</a>.) He means this declaration here to hold good of the <span class= "ital">details, </span>which are such as no one would <span class= "ital">invent</span> and teach with such solemnity; at the same time it must be remembered, with regard to the details, that it is the very idiom of prophecy (which St. Paul here uses) to express by material imagery spiritual facts.<p><span class= "bld">We which are alive and remain.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">We, </span>(<span class= "ital">that is</span>)<span class= "ital"> the quick, those who are left over.</span> There is not the least necessity for supposing from these words that St. Paul confidently <span class= "ital">expected</span> the Advent before his death. Very likely he did, but it cannot be proved from this passage. Had the “we” stood alone, without the explanatory participles, it might have amounted to a proof, but not so now. His converts are strongly under the impression that <span class= "ital">they</span> will be alive at the Coming, and that it will be the worse for the departed: therefore, St. Paul (becoming all things to all men) identifies himself with them—assumes that it will be as they expected—and proves the more vividly the fallacy of the Thessalonians’ fears. It would have been impossible, on the contrary, for St. Paul to have said “we which are dead” without definitely abandoning the hope of seeing the Return. Besides which, St. Paul is only <span class= "ital">picturing</span> to imagination the <span class= "ital">scene</span> of the Advent; and for any man it is far easier to imagine himself among the quick than among the dead at that moment.<p><span class= "bld">Shall not prevent</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“be before,” “get the start of.” If it were not for these words, we might have fancied that the Thessalonians had not been taught to believe in a resurrection at all; which would have been a strange departure from the usual apostolic gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> We here learn what was the exact nature of the Thessalonians’ anxiety concerning the dead. They were full of excited hopes of the coming of that kingdom which had formed so prominent a part of the Apostles’ preaching there (<a href="/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a>); and were afraid that the highest glories in that kingdom would be engrossed by those who were alive to receive them; and that the dead, not being to rise till afterwards, would have less blessed privileges. This would make them not only sorry for their dead friends, but also reluctant to die themselves. The negative in this clause is very emphatic in the Greek, and throws all its force upon the verb: “We shall certainly not get the <span class= "ital">start</span> of them that sleep;” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“if anything, we shall be <span class= "ital">behind</span> them; they will rise <span class= "ital">first.”</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord </span>— By a particular revelation from him. No words, as Dr. Doddridge observes, can more plainly assert that, in what follows, the apostle declares precisely what God revealed to him, and consequently that there can be no room for any such interpretation of this passage, as supposed him to be at all mistaken in any circumstance of the account he gives. <span class="ital">That we who are alive and remain </span>— This manner of speaking intimates the fewness of those who will be then alive, compared with the multitude of the dead. It is well observed, says Whitby, by the Greek scholiasts, that <span class="ital">the apostle speaks these words, not of himself, but of the Christians that should be found alive at the second coming of Christ: </span>so Chrysostom, Theodoret, Œcumenius, and Theophylact; for he well knew that he was not to live till the resurrection: yea, he himself expected a resurrection, saying to the Corinthians, <span class="ital">He that raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise up us also by Jesus, and present us with you, </span><a href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>. He <span class="ital">laboured that he might attain to the resurrection of the dead, </span><a href="/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Php 3:11</a>. Yet some divines have inferred, from this and some other places in the epistles, that the apostles themselves thought and taught, that they might live until the second coming of Christ; and that St. Paul afterward changed his opinion on this subject, and admonished the Thessalonians of it, <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand....">2 Thessalonians 2:2-6</a>. But this certainly is a dangerous mistake, and highly prejudicial to the authority of the apostles, and therefore to the Christian faith. Indeed, if the churches of Christ had once received this doctrine from them, and afterward had understood, even from their own confession, that it was a mistake, this would naturally have led them to conceive that the apostles might have been mistaken also in any other doctrine, and to suspect the truth of all that was contained in their epistles. This the apostle seems to insinuate, <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,...">2 Thessalonians 2:1-2</a>. But that this apostle taught no such doctrine in either of his epistles to the Thessalonians, will be exceeding evident, 1st, From the following words in that chapter, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>, <span class="ital">Let no man deceive you by any means, </span>declaring them deceivers who either taught this doctrine, or imposed it on them as taught by the apostles; and also having said, in opposition to such an opinion, that day was not to come till there was <span class="ital">a falling away first, </span>adding, <span class="ital">Remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things? </span>He therefore had taught them the contrary before he had written either of these epistles, and, of consequence, cannot rationally be supposed to contradict himself. 2d, From the very words used in proof of this opinion, which are introduced with this solemn declaration, <span class="ital">This we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, </span>&c., in which words he most plainly vouches the authority of Christ for the truth of what he says; and therefore, if he were mistaken, either our Lord himself must have erred with him, or the apostle must vouch Christ’s word, and his authority, when Christ had spoken no such word, and given him no authority to declare such doctrine in his name; both which assertions overthrow the certainty and truth of all St. Paul’s epistles. And hence it follows that the apostle could not deliver this assertion in any other of his epistles, for all the learned agree in this, that these epistles to the Thessalonians were the first epistles St. Paul wrote; whence it must follow that he could not deliver, in his following writings to that church, or any other churches, that doctrine which he had so industriously before confuted, and declared very dangerous, in his epistle to the church of Thessalonica.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The truth is, such expressions as these, <span class="ital">we who are alive, </span>(<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>,) <span class="ital">we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, </span>&c., (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>,) are not to be understood of the writers themselves: they are mere figures of speech used by the best authors to draw their readers’ attention, or to soften some harsh or disagreeable sentiment; without intending to represent themselves either as of the number, or of the character, of the persons with whom they class themselves. Thus Hosea says, (<a href="/hosea/12-4.htm" title="Yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us;">Hosea 12:4</a>,) <span class="ital">God spake with </span>US <span class="ital">in Bethel; </span>and the psalmist, (<a href="/psalms/66-6.htm" title="He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.">Psalm 66:6</a>,) WE <span class="ital">rejoiced, </span>namely, at the Red sea, when divided; and, (<a href="/psalms/81-5.htm" title="This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.">Psalm 81:5</a>,) <span class="ital">I heard a language I understood not, </span>that is, in Egypt, though neither were in existence at the times when the facts referred to happened. This figure in the mouth of Christ’s disciples has a singular propriety, because all of them making but one collective body, of which Christ is the Head, and which is united by the mutual love of all the members, individuals may consider every thing happening to the members of this body, as happening to themselves. We <span class="ital">shall not prevent </span>— Or anticipate; <span class="ital">them who are asleep </span>— Shall not receive our glorified bodies before them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:13-18 Here is comfort for the relations and friends of those who die in the Lord. Grief for the death of friends is lawful; we may weep for our own loss, though it may be their gain. Christianity does not forbid, and grace does not do away, our natural affections. Yet we must not be excessive in our sorrows; this is too much like those who have no hope of a better life. Death is an unknown thing, and we know little about the state after death; yet the doctrines of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ, are a remedy against the fear of death, and undue sorrow for the death of our Christian friends; and of these doctrines we have full assurance. It will be some happiness that all the saints shall meet, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of heaven is to be with the Lord, to see him, live with him, and enjoy him for ever. We should support one another in times sorrow; not deaden one another's spirits, or weaken one another's hands. And this may be done by the many lessons to be learned from the resurrection of the dead, and the second coming of Christ. What! comfort a man by telling him he is going to appear before the judgment-seat of God! Who can feel comfort from those words? That man alone with whose spirit the Spirit of God bears witness that his sins are blotted out, and the thoughts of whose heart are purified by the Holy Spirit, so that he can love God, and worthily magnify his name. We are not in a safe state unless it is thus with us, or we are desiring to be so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord - By the command or inspired teaching of the Lord. Prof. Bush (Anastasis, p. 265) supposes that the apostle here alludes to what the Saviour says in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>, "And they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven," etc. It is possible that Paul may have designed a general allusion to all that the Lord had said about his coming, but there cannot have been an exclusive reference to that passage, for in what he says here there are several circumstances mentioned to which the Saviour in Matthew does not allude. The probability, therefore, is, that Paul means that the Lord Jesus had made a special communication to him on the subject.<p>That we which are alive - See this fully explained in the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>. From this expression, it would seem, that some of the Thessalonians supposed that Paul meant to teach that he himself, and many of the living, would survive until the coming of the Lord Jesus, and, of course, that that event was near at hand. That this was not his meaning, however, he is at special pains to show in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-10</a>.<p>And remain unto the coming of the Lord - Those Christians who shall then be alive.<p>Shall not prevent them which are asleep - Shall not precede; anticipate; go before. The word prevent with us is now commonly used in the sense of hinder, but this is never its meaning in the Scriptures. The word, in the time of the translators of the Bible, was used in its primitive and proper sense (praevenio), meaning to precede, or anticipate. <a href="//biblehub.com/job/3-12.htm">Job 3:12</a>," why did the knees prevent me?" That is, why did they anticipate me, so that I did not perish, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8</a>, "Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us;" that is, go before us in danger. <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-147.htm">Psalm 119:147</a>, "I prevented the dawning of the morning and cried;" that is, I anticipated it, or I prayed before the morning dawned. <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/17-25.htm">Matthew 17:25</a>," Jesus prevented him, saying;" that is, Jesus anticipated him; he commenced speaking before Peter had told him what he had said; compare <a href="/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-10.htm">Psalm 59:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-13.htm">Psalm 88:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/95-2.htm">Psalm 95:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-6.htm">2 Samuel 22:6</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/22-19.htm">2 Samuel 22:19</a>; <a href="/job/30-27.htm">Job 30:27</a>; <a href="/job/41-11.htm">Job 41:11</a> The meaning here is, that they who would be alive at the coming of the Lord Jesus, would not be "changed" and received up into glory before those who were in their graves were raised up. The object seems to be to correct an opinion which prevailed among the Thessalonians that they who should survive to the coming of the Lord Jesus would have great advantages over those who had died. What they supposed those advantages would be - whether the privilege of seeing him come, or that they would be raised to higher honors in heaven, or that they who had died would not rise at all, does not appear, nor is the origin of this sentiment known. It is clear, however, that it was producing an increase of their sorrow on the death of their pious friends, and hence it was very important to correct the error. The apostle, therefore, states that no such disadvantage could follow, for the matter of fact was, that the dead would rise first. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. by the word of the Lord&#8212;Greek, "in," that is, in virtue of a direct revelation from the Lord to me. So 1Ki 20:35. This is the "mystery," a truth once hidden, now revealed, which Paul shows (1Co 15:51, 52).<p>prevent&#8212;that is, "anticipate." So far were the early Christians from regarding their departed brethren as anticipating them in entering glory, that they needed to be assured that those who remain to the coming of the Lord "will not anticipate them that are asleep." The "we" means whichever of us are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord. The Spirit designed that believers in each successive age should live in continued expectation of the Lord's coming, not knowing but that they should be among those found alive at His coming (Mt 24:42). It is a sad fall from this blessed hope, that death is looked for by most men, rather than the coming of our Lord. Each successive generation in its time and place represents the generation which shall actually survive till His coming (Mt 25:13; Ro 13:11; 1Co 15:51; Jas 5:9; 1Pe 4:5, 6). The Spirit subsequently revealed by Paul that which is not inconsistent with the expectation here taught of the Lord's coming at any time; namely, that His coming would not be until there should be a "falling away first" (2Th 2:2, 3); but as symptoms of this soon appeared, none could say but that still this precursory event might be realized, and so the Lord come in his day. Each successive revelation fills in the details of the general outline first given. So Paul subsequently, while still looking mainly for the Lord's coming to clothe him with his body from heaven, looks for going to be with Christ in the meanwhile (2Co 5:1-10; Php 1:6, 23; 3:20, 21; 4:5). Edmunds well says, The "we" is an affectionate identifying of ourselves with our fellows of all ages, as members of the same body, under the same Head, Christ Jesus. So Ho 12:4, "God spake with us in Beth-el," that is, with Israel. "We did rejoice," that is, Israel at the Red Sea (Ps 66:6). Though neither Hosea, nor David, was alive at the times referred to, yet each identifies himself with those that were present.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle here sets down particularly the manner of the Lord’s coming, the method and order how all the saints shall then meet with him and with one another, which we find not so distinctly in any other scripture; and whereby he further prosecutes the argument he is upon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord; </span> that they might not think that what he speaks was either by some tradition from others, or an invention of his own; and that is ground enough for faith, to which our judgment and reason ought to be captivated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep:</span> that which he saith here about the resurrection, Christ’s coming, the ministry of angels, the sound of a trumpet, the voice of Christ at that day, we have it in the evangelists; but the method and order of all the saints meeting together, and meeting the Lord in the air, we find not in any express words before written; the apostle speaks it here by extraordinary revelation, which is the word of the Lord, though not then written. And this order is expressed: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Negatively.

The apostle having something new and extraordinary to deliver, concerning the coming of Christ, the first resurrection, or the resurrection of the saints, the change of the living saints, and the rapture both of the raised and living in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, expresses himself in this manner; either in allusion to the prophets of old, to whom the word of the Lord is said to come, and who usually introduced their prophecies with a "Thus saith the Lord"; or in distinction from his own private sense, sentiment, and opinion of things; signifying, that what he was about to say, was not a fancy and conjecture of his own, the fruit and produce of his own brain, but what he could assert upon a sure foundation, upon the best and greatest authority, even the word of the Lord; and has respect either to some particular word of Christ, as some think, such as <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> or rather to a particular and peculiar revelation, and special instruction in these things, he had immediately from Christ; and it may be when he was caught up into the third heaven himself, and had an experience in himself of somewhat of that which both the living and raised saints shall feel, when they are caught up together in the clouds; since the change of the living saints, at the time of the resurrection of the dead, is a mystery which seems to have been first made known unto, and discovered by the Apostle Paul; see <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>. <p>That we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord: not that the apostle thought that he and the saints then in the flesh should live and continue till the second coming of Christ; for he did not imagine that the coming of Christ was so near, as is manifest from <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a> though the Thessalonians might take him in this sense, which he there corrects; but he speaks of himself and others in the first person plural, by way of instance and example, for illustration sake; that supposing he and others should be then in being, the following would be the case: and moreover, he might use such a way of speaking with great propriety of other saints, and even of those unborn, and that will be on the spot when Christ shall come a second time; since all the saints make up one body, one family, one church and general assembly; so that the apostle might truly and justly say, "we which are alive"; that is, as many of our body, of our family, of our church or society, that shall be living at the coming of Christ; and he might choose the rather to speak in this form, person, and tense, to awaken the care, circumspection, diligence, and watchfulness of the saints, since it could not be known how soon the Lord would come: however, from hence it appears, that there will be saints alive at Christ's second coming; he will have a seed to serve him till he comes again; he always had in the worst of times, and will have, and that even in the last days, in the days of the son of man, which are said to be like those of Noah and of Lot: and these are said to "remain", or to be "left", these will be a remnant, the residue and remainder of the election of grace, and will be such as have escaped the fury of antichrist and his followers, or of the persecutors of the saints: now these <p>shall not prevent them that are asleep; that is, that are dead, so the Ethiopic version; the reason why the dead are so called, see in the note on the preceding verses: the sense is, either they "shall not come up to them that are asleep, or dead", as the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render the words; they shall not come into the state of the dead, they shall undergo a change equivalent to death, but not death itself; see <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a> or rather they "shall not go before" them; they shall not get the start of them, and be in the arms of Jesus, and enjoy his presence when he comes, before the dead in Christ, which might be thought, but this will not be the case; for the dead saints will rise before the living ones are changed, and both will be caught up together to meet the Lord, as is said in the following verses; so that the one shall not come or go before the other, or come at, or into the enjoyment of Christ first, but both together. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> For this we say unto you by the <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> word of the Lord, that <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> we which are alive <i>and</i> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</span><p>(13) The manner of the resurrection will be in this way: the bodies of the dead will be as it were raised out of sleep at the sound of the trumpet of God.

But the expressions found there are too general to be identified with the special thought in our passage. Schott’s statement, that Paul might justly appeal to the prophecy in <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm" title="And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.">Matthew 24:31</a>, because it contained nothing of a prerogative of the living before the dead, but on the contrary represents simply an assembling of believing confessors with a view to the participation of the Messianic kingdom, is subtle, and does not correspond to the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου</span>, which points to positive information concerning the definite subject in question. Also Luthardt’s (l.c. pp. 141, 57) view, that in <span class="greekheb">λόγος κυρίου</span> a reference is made to the parable of the virgins who went out to meet the bridegroom (Matthew 25), and for which view <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀπάντησιν</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>) is most arbitrarily appealed to, is evidently erroneous. Others, as Calvin and Koch, have thought that Paul referred to a saying of Christ not preserved in the Gospels, but transmitted by tradition. (So, recently, also v. Zezschwitz, l.c. p. 121, according to whom the apostle thought “on a word” which is “to be sought for in the peculiar and intimate communications of our Lord to His disciples, such as He would have given them during the forty days, when He spoke with them concerning the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>.”) This supposition may certainly be supported by the analogy of <a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>; but it must always remain precarious, the more so as there was no inducement to Christ, in His intimations concerning the period of the fulfilment of the Messianic kingdom, to make such special questions, arising only in consequence of concrete circumstances, the subject of an anticipated instruction. It is best, therefore, with Chrysostom, Theodoret, Hunnius, Piscator (who, however, arbitrarily supposes the fact described in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>), Aretius, Turretin, Benson, Moldenhauer, Koppe, Olshausen, de Wette, Gess (die Lehre von der Person Christi, Basel 1856, p. 69 f.), Alford, Riggenbach, and others, to suppose that Paul appeals to information concerning the matter in hand which had been communicated to him in a direct revelation by the heavenly Christ; comp. <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

From the construction of these words it undoubtedly follows, that Paul reckoned himself with those who would survive till the commencement of the advent, as indeed the same expectation is also expressed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a> f.

This expectation is not confirmed by history: Paul and all his contemporaries fell a prey to death. What wonder, then, if from an early period of the Christian church this plain meaning of the word was resisted, and in its place the most artificial and distorted interpretations were substituted? For that Paul could be capable of error was regarded as an objectionable concession, as an infringement upon the divine authority of the apostle. It has therefore almost universally[57] been maintained by interpreters, that Paul speaks neither of himself nor of his contemporaries, but of a later period of Christianity. So Chrysostom, Theodoret, John Damascenus, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Castalio, Calvin, Musculus, Bullinger, Zanchius, Hunnius, Balduin, Vorstius, Cornelius a Lapide, Jac. Laurentius, Calixt, Calov, Joach. Lange, Whitby, Benson, Bengel, Flatt, and many others. Whilst Calvin and Cornelius a Lapide, in order to remove difficulties, do not scruple to charge the apostle with a pious fraud; supposing that he, although he was convinced of the distance of the advent, nevertheless represented himself as surviving, in order in this way to stimulate believers to be in a state of spiritual readiness at every instant; Oecumenius, after the example of Methodius, interprets <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΖῶΝΤΕς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> of the <span class="ital">souls</span>, and <span class="greekheb">οἱ κοιμηθέντες</span> of the <span class="ital">bodies</span> of Christians; <span class="greekheb">ζῶντας τὰς ψυχάς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κοιμηθέντα δὲ τὰ σώματα λέγει</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἂν οὖν προλάβωσιν αἱ ψυχαί</span>· <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον γὰρ ἐγείρεται τὰ σώματα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα αὐτὰ ἀπολάβωσιν αἱ ψυχαί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἃς καὶ περιλιμπάνεσθαί φησι διὰ τὸ ἀθάνατον</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἄν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ περὶ ψυχῶν ἔλεγεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἶπε τὸ ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες οἱ περιλειπόμενοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τελευτήσειν μέλλων</span>· <span class="greekheb">λέγει οὖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οἱ ζῶντες αἱ ψυχαὶ οὐκ ἂν τὰ σώματα προφθάσωμεν ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μετʼ αὐτῶν τῆς ἀναστάσεως τευξώμεθα</span>. Usually, however, in order to remove the objectionableness of the words, an appeal is made to the fact that by means of an “<span class="ital">enallage personae</span>” or an <span class="greekheb">ἀνακοίνωσις</span>, something is often said of a collective body which, accurately taken, is only suited to a part. Then the sense would be: we Christians, namely, those of us who are alive at the commencement of the advent, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the later generation of Christians who will survive the advent. But however often <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜΕῖς</span></span></span> is used in a communicative form, yet in this passage such an interpretation is impossible, because here <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΕῖς ΟἹ ΖῶΝΤΕς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, as a <span class="ital">peculiar class of Christians</span>, are placed in sharp distinction from <span class="greekheb">κοιμηθέντες</span>, as a <span class="ital">second</span> class. Accordingly, in order to obtain the sense assumed, the words would require to have been written: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἡμῶν οἱ ζῶντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ μὴ φθάσονται τοὺς κοιμηθέντας</span>, apart altogether from the fact that also in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1 Thessalonians 5:4</a> the possibility is expressed, that the day of the Lord might break in upon the <span class="ital">presently</span> existing Thessalonian church. Not less arbitrary is it, with Joachim Lange, to explain the words: “we who live <span class="ital">in our posterity</span>,” for which an additional clause would be necessary. Or, with Turretin, Pelt, and others, to understand <span class="greekheb">οἱ ζῶντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ περιλειπόμενοι</span> in a hypothetical sense: we, <span class="ital">provided</span> we are then alive, <span class="ital">provided</span> we still remain. (So, in essentials, Hofmann: by those who are alive are meant those who had not already died.) For then, instead of <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ περιλειπόμενοι</span>, it would necessarily require <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΕῖς ΖῶΝΤΕς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΕΡΙΛΕΙΠΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> (without an article). The same also is valid against J. P. Lange (<span class="ital">Das apostol. Zeitalter</span>, I., Braunschw. 1853, p. 113): “The words, ‘the living, the surviving,’ are for the purpose of making the contrast a variable one, whilst they condition and limit the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> in the sense: we, so <span class="ital">many of us</span> (!), who yet live and have survived; or (?) rather, we in so far as we temporarily represent the living and remaining, in contrast to our dead.” Lastly, the view of Hoelemann (<span class="ital">Die Stellung St. Pauli zu der Frage um die Zeit der Wiederkunft Christi</span>, Leipz. 1858, p. 29) is not less refuted by the article before <span class="greekheb">ζῶντες</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΛΕΙΠΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span>: “The discourse, starting from the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΕῖς</span></span></span> and rising more and more beyond this <span class="ital">concrete</span> beginning, by forming, with the next two notions <span class="greekheb">οἱ ζῶντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ περιλειπόμενοι</span>, always <span class="ital">wider</span> (!) and softer circles, strives to a <span class="ital">generic</span> (!) thought—namely, to this, that Paul and the contemporary Thessalonians, while in the <span class="ital">changing</span> state of <span class="greekheb">περιλείπεσθαι</span> (being left behind), might be indeed personally taken away beforehand; although the opposite possibility, that they themselves might yet be the <span class="ital">surviving</span> generation, is included in the <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες</span> with which the thought begins, and which always echoes through it.” Every unprejudiced person must, even from those dogmatic suppositions, recognise that Paul here includes himself, along with the Thessalonians, among those who will be alive at the advent of Christ. Certainly this can only have been a hope, only a subjective expectation on the part of the apostle; as likewise, in the fifth chapter, although he there considers the advent as impending and coming suddenly, yet he supposes the indefiniteness of the proper period of its commencement (comp. also <a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>). That the apostle here states his surviving only as a supposition or a hope, is not nullified by the fact that he imparts the information (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΛΌΓῼ ΚΥΡΊΟΥ</span></span></span>. For the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΟς ΚΥΡΊΟΥ</span></span></span> can, according to the context, only refer to the relation of those who are asleep to the living; but does not refer to the fact who will belong to the one or to the other class at the commencement of the advent. Only on the first point was the comforting information contained which the Thessalonians required.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The present participles <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῶΝΤΕς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΛΕΙΠΌΜΕΝΟΙ</span></span></span> are not to be taken as futures (Calvin, Flatt, Pelt), but denote the condition as it exists in the present, and stretches itself to the advent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΜῊ ΦΘΆΣΩΜΕΝ ΤΟῪς ΚΟΙΜΗΘΈΝΤΑς</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">shall by no means precede those who are asleep</span>, so that <span class="ital">we</span> would reach the end (the blessedness of the advent), but <span class="ital">they</span> would be left behind us, and accordingly lose the prize.

Evidently Paul had not had time or occasion to speak of such a contingency, when he was with them.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ κυρίου</span> may mean either (<span class="ital">a</span>) a quotation (like <a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>) from the sayings of Jesus, or (<span class="ital">b</span>) a prophetic revelation vouchsafed to Paul himself, or to Silvanus (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a>). In the former case (so, among modern editors, Schott, Ewald, Drummond, Wohl.), an <span class="greekheb">ἄγραφον</span> is cited (Calvin, Koch, Weizsäcker, Resch, <span class="ital">Paulinismus</span>, 238 f.; Ropes, <span class="ital">die Sprüche Jesu</span>, 153 f.; M.

Holtzmann, <span class="ital">Life of Jesus</span>, 10; von Soden) but it is evidently given in a free form, and the precise words cannot (even in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>) be disentangled. Besides we should expect <span class="greekheb">τινι</span> to be added. Unless, therefore, we are to think of a primitive collection (Lake, <span class="ital">Amer. Journ.

The contents of <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm" title="And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.">Matthew 24:31</a> (part of the small apocalypse) are too dissimilar to favour the conjecture (Pelt, Zimmer, Weiss) that Paul was thinking of this saying as current perhaps in oral tradition, and the O.T. analogy of <span class="greekheb">λόγος Κυρίου</span> (= God’s prophetic word), together with the internal probabilities of the case (Paul does not remind them of it, as elsewhere in the epistle) make it on the whole more likely that Paul is repeating words heard in a vision (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

Paulus</span>, 178, 179. Later in the century a similar difficulty vexed the pious Jew who wrote Fourth Esdras (5:41, 42: <span class="ital">I said, But lo, O Lord, thou hast made the promise to those who shall be in the end: and what shall they do that have been before us …? And He said to me, I will liken my judgment to a ring; as there is no slackness of those who are last, so shall there be no swiftness of those who are first</span>). His theory is that the previous generations of Israel will be as well off as their posterity in the latter days. Further on (13:14 f.) he raises and answers the question whether it was better to die before the last days or to live until they came (the phrase, <span class="ital">those that are left</span>, “qui relicti sunt,” 7:28 = Paul’s <span class="greekheb">οἱ περιλειπόμενοι</span>). His solution (which Steck, in <span class="ital">Jahrb. für prot. Theol.</span>, 1883, 509–524, oddly regards as the <span class="greekheb">λόγος κ</span>. of <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; see Schmidt’s refutation, pp. 107–110) is the opposite of Paul’s: <span class="ital">those who are left are more blessed than those who have died</span>. If this difficulty was felt in Jewish circles during the first half of the century, it may have affected those of the Thessalonian Christians who had been formerly connected with the synagogue, but the likelihood is that Paul’s language is coloured by his own Jewish training (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Charles on <span class="ital">Asc. Isa.</span>, iv. 15). The misunderstanding of the Thessalonians, which had led to their sorrow and perplexity, was evidently due to the fact that, for some reason or another, Paul had not mentioned the possibility of any Christians dying before the second advent (so sure was he that all would soon survive it), coupled with the fact that Greeks found it hard to grasp what exactly resurrection meant (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/17-32.htm" title="And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.">Acts 17:32</a>) for Christians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">in a word of the Lord</span>,—in the character of a message coming from “the mouth of the Lord;” comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>, “I give charge,—not I, but the Lord;” and ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a> above, “not men’s word, but God’s.” The “word” that follows (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep....">1 Thessalonians 4:15-17</a></span>) can hardly be explained as a traditional saying of Christ, unrecorded in the Gospels, like <a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>; nor as an inference from the teaching of Jesus on the subject of His return. St Paul claims to have received this communication directly from Christ, “the Lord” of His Church, as a revelation to himself (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>, <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a> for similar instances), given to him expressly in order to allay the fears of his readers. The <span class="ital">Lord</span> is manifestly Christ, as it is four times in the immediate sequel. St Paul applies to Christ’s word the same august phrase that in the O. T. denotes “the word of God” Himself; comp. note on ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that we which are alive</span> and <span class="ital">remain unto the coming of the Lord</span>] This should be: <span class="bld">we that are alive, that remain</span> (or <span class="bld">survive</span>) <span class="bld">unto the coming of the Lord</span>. The second designation qualifies the first,—“those (I mean) who survive till the Lord comes.” St Paul did not count on any very near approach of the second Advent: comp. <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,...">2 Thessalonians 2:1-2</a>. At the same time, his language implies the <span class="ital">possibility</span> of the great event taking place within his lifetime, or that of the present generation. This remained an open question, or rather a matter on which questioning was forbidden (see <a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36</a>). “Concerning the times and seasons” nothing was definitely known (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1 Thessalonians 5:1</a>, see note). The Apostles “knew in part” and “prophesied in part” (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>); and until further light came, it was natural for the Church, ever sighing “Come Lord Jesus, come quickly!” to speak as St Paul does here. The same “we” occurs in this connection in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,...">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>. But from the time of the dangerous illness recorded in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:...">2 Corinthians 1:8-9</a>, the prospect of death occupied the foreground in the Apostle’s thoughts of his own future, and he never afterwards writes “<span class="ital">we</span> that remain.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall not prevent</span>] “Prevent” is obsolete in this sense: comp. the Collect, “<span class="ital">Prevent</span> us in all our doings with Thy most gracious favour.” Better, <span class="bld">shall in no wise precede</span> (or <span class="ital">anticipate</span>) <span class="bld">those that fell asleep</span>. The shadow which the event of their premature death had cast over the fate of the sleeping Thessalonian believers was wholly imaginary, and should be dismissed at once from the minds of their sorrowing friends. Instead of their having no place, they will have, as Christ now reveals to His Apostle, the <span class="ital">foremost</span> place in His triumphant return. Though dead, they are “dead in Christ” (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>),—departed to “be with Christ”—“absent from the body” but “at home with the Lord,” as St Paul subsequently teaches (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:...">2 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Php 1:23</a>). So it cannot be that those who are found in the flesh when He comes again, will be beforehand with them in this reunion. “God will bring them with Him,” for they are with Him already.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle proceeds to support this assurance by a description of Christ’s coming, derived from the revelation, or “word of the Lord,” to which he has just appealed. This was one of the most remarkable of the many “visions and revelations” which St Paul experienced (comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord....">2 Corinthians 12:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑμῖν</span>) To you, who are worthy of knowing this.—<span class="greekheb">λέγομεν ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου</span>, <span class="ital">we say by the word of the Lord</span>) The Lord, the Christ, has spoken to us; we have spoken to you: comp. <a href="/1_kings/20-35.htm" title="And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you. And the man refused to smite him.">1 Kings 20:35</a>, <span class="greekheb">בדבר יהוה</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου</span>, by the word of the Lord. Phrases such as these are used in respect of a matter which is now for the first time opened up (disclosed), [Many matters connected with an altogether extraordinary subject, which would be in vain sought for elsewhere, are here discussed.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>, we) The saints, by speaking thus in their own age, have greatly added to the obligation resting on those of following ages to look for the Lord. The we is presently explained by the following words, who are alive, and further on, who remain.—<span class="greekheb">οἱ ζῶντες οἱ περιλειπόμενοι</span>, who live, who remain [who live, surviving]) So also <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>. This is equivalent to an apposition. Who live, is an antithesis to, who sleep. There is at the same time intimated the small number of those who live, compared with the multitude of the dead; likewise the good condition of those who are asleep, so that the living may desire to be gathered to them. Men of all ages conjointly have a lively anticipation of [realize to themselves the immediate fulfilment of] some one thing;[20] and so believers, who are now long waiting, and who regard themselves in the light of persons who are to live at the coming of the Lord, have spoken in accordance with this their character (spake in the manner that became the character they represented, viz. those who shall be alive at the Lord’s coming). Those <span class="ital">who live</span>, and <span class="ital">those who remain till the coming of the Lord</span>, are the same, and these are denoted by the pronoun <span class="ital">we</span>. Each generation, which lives at this or that time, occupies, during that period of their life, the place of those who are to live at the time of the coming of the Lord.[21] So the <span class="ital">we</span> is put here, as elsewhere the names <span class="ital">Cajus</span> and <span class="ital">Titius</span>,[22] and that, too, with the greater propriety, because believers of that age [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> of each successive past age] have not yet been allowed distinctly to know the vast period of time to elapse till the end of the world. The present tense in both participles is in reference to [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> in order to suit] the coming of the Lord itself, as in <a href="/acts/10-42.htm" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.">Acts 10:42</a> [<span class="greekheb">παρήγγειλεν κηρῦξαι ὅτι αὐτός ἐστιν</span>], and elsewhere frequently. Hence Paul has not hereby asserted that the day of Christ is so near; see <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand....">2 Thessalonians 2:2-3</a>.

We know from Scripture that Paul had many such revelations imparted to him (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord.</span> These words are the occasion of an important discussion. It has been affirmed that the apostle here asserts that he himself expected to be alive, with the majority of those to whom he was writing, at the Lord's advent; that, according to his expectation, Christ's second coming was close at hand. "Those who are alive and remain" are distinguished from "those who are asleep," and in the former class the apostle includes himself and his readers. And a similar declaration is contained in the First Epistle to the Corinthians: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). Such is the view adopted by Grotius, Olshausen, Koch, Neander, Lechler, Baur, Winer, Reuse, Lunemann, Riggenbach; and, among English divines, by Alford, Jowett, Stanley, and Conybeare. Some of them suppose that Paul changed his opinion on this point - that whilst in his earlier Epistles he taught the immediateness of the advent, in his later Epistles he renounced this hope and looked forward to his own departure. There does not seem to be any ground for this opinion. On the contrary, it would appear from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, written only a few weeks after this Epistle, that Paul did not expect the advent immediately, but mentions a series of events which would intervene before its occurrence (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-3</a>). And in this Epistle he represses the curiosity of the Thessalonians about the precise time of the advent by telling them that it was beyond the sphere of his teaching (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1, 2</a>). We consider, then, that the apostle speaks here as a member of the Christian body, and uses a very common form of expression - that we Christians which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord; but not at all intending to express his confidence that he himself and his converts would be actually alive at the advent. "He spake," says St. Chrysostom, "not of himself, but of Christians who would be alive at the day of judgment." Such is the view adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Bengel, Hofmann, Lunge, Macknight, Ellicott, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Vaughan. At the same time, it must be remembered that the time of the advent was expressly concealed (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and that it might occur at any period; and, by reason of their proximity to the first advent, the primitive Christians would be deeply impressed with the possibility or even probability of its occurrence in their days. Christians were to be living always in readiness for this great event, and thus it became a matter of expectation. "Strictly speaking, the expectation of the day of the Lord was not a belief, but a necessity in the early Church; clinging as it did to the thought of Christ, it could not bear to be separated from him; it was his absence, not his presence, that the first believers found it hard to realize" (Jowett). Hence Paul might not regard the advent as far removed into the distant future, as wholly impossible to happen in his days, but as an occurrence which might at any time take place; but he did not teach anything definite or certain on the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Shall not prevent</span>; go before or anticipate, obtain the preference over, get before, so that those that are asleep might be left behind and fail of the prize. <span class="cmt_word">Them that are asleep</span>; those who are dead, so that they, the living, should be glorified before them, or perhaps hinder their glorification. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By the word of the Lord (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Or in the word. &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; of a concrete saying, <a href="/romans/9-9.htm">Romans 9:9</a>; <a href="/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>.
