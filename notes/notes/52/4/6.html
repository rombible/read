It is a <span class= "ital">final</span> clause, expressing the <span class= "ital">purpose</span> of such continence as has just been described.

The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That no man go beyond - &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  huperbainein. This word means, "to make to go over," as, e. g., a wall or mountain; then, to overpass, to wit, certain limits, to transgress; and then to go too far, i. e., to go beyond right - hence to cheat or defraud. It is not used elsewhere in the New Testament.

According to the reading in the margin, this would refer to the particular matter under discussion <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>, to wit, concupiscence. and the meaning then would be, that no one should be guilty of illicit intercourse with the wife of another. Many expositors - as Hammond Whitby, Macknight, Rosenmuller, and others, suppose that this is a prohibition of adultery, and there can be no doubt that it does include this. But there is no reason why it should be confined to it. The Greek is so general that it may prohibit all kinds of fraud, overreaching, or covetousness, and may refer to any attempt to deprive another of his rights, whether it be the right which he has in his property, or his rights as a husband, or his rights in any other respect. It is a general command not to defraud; in no way to take advantage of another; in no way to deprive him of his rights.<p>Because that the Lord is the avenger of all such - Of all such as are guilty of fraud; that is, he will punish them; compare <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a> note; <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a> note.<p>As we also have forewarned - Doubtless when he was with them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. go beyond&#8212;transgress the bounds of rectitude in respect to his "brother."<p>defraud&#8212;"overreach" [Alford]; "take advantage of" [Edmunds].<p>in any matter&#8212;rather as Greek, "in the matter"; a decorous expression for the matter now in question; the conjugal honor of his neighbor as a husband, 1Th 4:4; 1Th 4:7 also confirms this view; the word "brother" enhances the enormity of the crime.

And as before he spake of chastity, so here of commutative justice in commerce and traffic; and the rather because Thessalonica was a city of great trade and merchandise, and it is true that sanctification doth comprehend this righteousness in it, and will restrain men from that which is opposite to it, which, as the apostle speaks, is going beyond and defrauding his brother. To <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">go beyond, </span> is that which we call overreaching; when in buying or selling we keep not a just measure, when we observe not a due proportion between the price and the commodity, considering it either in its natural worth, or in such circumstances as make it more or less valuable: or, to take advantage of another’s ignorance or necessities, to take unreasonable profit: or, to break covenant with another, answering to the Hebrew word <span class="ital">Gnabhar, </span> used in this sense, <span class="bld"><a href="/deuteronomy/17-2.htm" title="If there be found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, man or woman, that has worked wickedness in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,">Deu 17:2</a></span>: the original word signifies to transgress, or go above the due bounds. And to <span class="bld">defraud</span> is, when, out of a covetous mind, we exact upon another beyond what is meet. Some refer the former word to injustice by force, and the latter by fraud, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a></span>. And the evil is the greater because done to a <span class="bld">brother.</span> There is a brother by a common relation, and so all men that partake of human nature are brethren; or by special relation, which is either natural, civil, or spiritual. We may understand the word in all these senses, especially the last, that those that are brethren in Christ and in the faith, should not defraud one another. And when the apostle adds, <span class="ital">in any matter, </span> the word <span class="ital">any</span> not being in the Greek, we may better read it, in dealing, or doing; the word is general, and is to be restrained by the subject matter spoken of. There is another sense of the words, agreeable to the former verses, and the verse that follows, and so some understand the apostle as still speaking of chastity; and so here he forbids the invading another’s bed, transgressing the bounds of marriage, whereby men go beyond or defraud their brother, usurping the use of another man’s wife, whom he hath no right to. And then <span class="ital">in any matter</span> we must read, in that matter which he had been speaking of before, or it is a modest expression of the act of adultery. The Hebrew <span class="ital">Bo</span> is often used in the Old Testament for carnal copulation, and thence the Greek bainw and uqerbainw, here used; and the other word, qleonektein, denotes excessiveness in it, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm" title="Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.">Ephesians 4:19</a></span>.

Or "in this matter", as the Syriac version. This is commonly understood of transgressing the bounds of justice and equity between men and men; and of cheating and defrauding in trade and business, by increasing or lessening the value and prices of goods by the buyer and seller, by not keeping to the bargain, contract, covenant, or sample, by false weights and measures, and by taking the advantage of the weakness and ignorance of men; all which is aggravated by dealing thus with a brother; see <a href="/1_corinthians/6-8.htm">1 Corinthians 6:8</a> and this hint is thought the rather necessary, since Thessalonica was a place of great trade and business. But the matter, or business referred to, is not trade, but the subject of chastity or uncleanness the apostle is speaking of, both before and after; and the phrases used either design the act of adultery, coveting a brother's wife, and lying with her, and so a defrauding and wronging of him by defiling his bed; or rather sodomitical practices, an unnatural lust and desire in men after men, and copulation with them; for  rendered, "go beyond", answers to , "to go upon", or "lie with", so often used in Jewish writings for lying with women, men, and beasts, in an unlawful way. Thus, for instance (y), <p>"these are to be burned,  , "he that lies with a woman", and her daughter, &amp;c.'' <p>And again (z), <p>"these are to be beaten, , "he that lies with" his sister, or his father's sister, &amp;c.'' <p>And the word  translated "defraud", signifies a greedy, insatiable, and unnatural lust and desire after a man, a brother, or the committing of sodomitical practices with greediness: see <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a> which abominable iniquities are dissuaded from by the following reasons, <p>because that the Lord is the avenger of all such; or "with respect to all these things", as the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions render it; or "for all these things", as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; as fornication, adultery, lasciviousness, and all sorts of abominable uncleanness. The person that commits these things the Lord avenges, either in this life, by the hand of the civil magistrate, who is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that does evil; or by a violent death, as in the case of Zimri and Cozbi, and twenty four thousand more at the same time; or by some awful judgment from heaven, as in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah; or in the world to come; for the law of God is made and lies against such persons; these living and dying in such sins God will judge, to whom vengeance belongs; these shall not inherit the kingdom of God, but have their part and portion in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone. <p>As we have also forewarned you and testified; not by a former epistle, as if this was the second to them, and what follows the first, as Grotius thought; but they did this when they were in person with them, knowing that these abominable vices greatly prevailed in their city; therefore they bore their testimony against them, and exposed the evil of them, and warned them of the danger by them, so that they could not now plead ignorance. The Ethiopic version reads in the first person singular, "as I have before said unto you, and testified to you". <p>(y) Misna Sanhedrim, c. 9. sect. 1.((z) Misna Maccot, c. 3. sect. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> That no <i>man</i> go beyond and defraud his brother in <i>any</i> matter: because that the Lord <i>is</i> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</span><p>(5) Secondly, he reprehends all violent oppression, and immoderate desire, and shows most severely as the Prophet of God, that God will avenge such wickedness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>.

If Pelt objects against our view that a mention of covetousness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>) would occur “plane inexspectato,” he does not consider that <span class="ital">lust and covetousness</span> were the two cardinal vices of the heathen world, and that Paul was accustomed elsewhere to mention them together; comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm" title="Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.">Ephesians 4:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>. Also, the further objection which is insisted on, that on account of <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a> an exhortation to chastity must be contained in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>, is not convincing, as there is nothing to prevent us taking <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἁγιασμός</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a> (see on passage), in the wider sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τό</span>] not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span> (Baumgarten-Crusius), but a second exponent of the object-matter of <span class="greekheb">θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπερβαίνειν</span>] here only in the N. T., stands absolutely: justos fines migrare, to grasp too far (Luther). Comp. Eurip. <span class="ital">Alc.</span> 1077: <span class="greekheb">μὴ νῦν ὑπέρβαινʼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐναισίμως φέρε</span>, <span class="ital">Il.</span> ix. 501: <span class="greekheb">ὅτε κέν τις ὑπερβήῃ καὶ ἁμάρτῃ</span>. The idea of an “oppressio violenti, qualis tyrannorum et potentium est, qui inferiores injustis exactionibus aut aliis illicitis modis premunt” (Hemming) is inserted, and every supplement, as that of Piscator, “excedere mordum in augendis rerum pretiis,” is to be rejected. What Paul particularly understood by the entirely general <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὑπερβαίνειν</span> he himself indicates by <span class="greekheb">καὶ πλεονεκτεῖν</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, which latter words, as <span class="greekheb">μή</span> is not repeated before <span class="greekheb">πλεονεκτεῖν</span>, can contain no independent requirement, but must be an explanatory specification of <span class="greekheb">ὑπερβαίνειν</span>. <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is accordingly to be understood in the sense of “and indeed.” Others, as Beza, Koppe, Pelt, Baumgarten-Crusius, Alford, Hofmann, Riggenbach, have united <span class="ital">both</span> verbs with <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀδελφόν</span>. But the union of <span class="greekheb">ὑπερβαίνειν</span> with a <span class="ital">personal</span> object is objectionable, and also in the two passages adduced for it by Kypke (Plutarch, <span class="ital">de amore prolis</span>, p. 496, and Demosthenes, <span class="ital">adv. Aristocrat.</span> p. 439) the meaning <span class="ital">opprimere</span> is at least not demonstrable. Moreover, not <span class="greekheb">ἕκαστον</span>, from <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm" title="That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> (Baumgarten-Crusius, Alford), but <span class="greekheb">τινά</span>, is to be considered as the subject to <span class="greekheb">τὸ μὴ ὑπερβαίνειν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πλεονεκτεῖν</span>] expresses the overreaching, the fraudulent pursuit of our own gain springing from covetousness (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?...">2 Corinthians 12:17-18</a>), not the covetous encroaching upon the possession of a brother, as a figurative expression for adultery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ πράγματι</span>] is not <span class="ital">verecunde pro concubitu</span> (Estius and those mentioned above), but means <span class="ital">in the business</span> (now, or at any time in hand). Too narrow a sense, Piscator: <span class="ital">in emendo et vendendo</span>. Rittershus. Polyc. Leyser (in Wolf), and Koppe consider the article as enclitic (<span class="greekheb">ἔν τῳ</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἔν τινι</span>); unnecessary, and without any analogy in the New Testament. Comp. Winer, p. 50 [E. T. 61]. But also erroneously, Macknight, Schott, Olshausen, and others, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ πράγματι</span> is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ τῷ πράγματι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ</span>] is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τὸν πλησίον</span> (Schott, Koch, and others), but denotes fellow-Christians; comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm" title="And indeed you do it toward all the brothers which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brothers, that you increase more and more;">1 Thessalonians 4:10</a>. This limitation of the prohibition to Christians is not surprising (Schrader), as there is no emphasis on <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ</span> (for otherwise it must have been written <span class="greekheb">τὸ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ μὴ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), and accordingly the misinterpretation that the conduct of Christians to those who are not Christians is to be different, could not possibly arise. Paul simply names the circle which stood <span class="ital">nearest</span> to the Christians, but without intending to exclude thereby the wider circles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔκδικος</span>] <span class="ital">an avenger</span>; comp. <a href="/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good.

Compare the saying: <span class="greekheb">ἔχει Θεὸς ἔκδικον ὄμμα</span> (Homer, <span class="ital">Batrachom.</span>), which has become a proverb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθὼς καί</span>] refers back to <span class="greekheb">διότι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προείπομεν</span>] <span class="ital">foretold</span>; the <span class="greekheb">προ</span> refers to the time preceding the future judgment, and the preterite to the time of the apostle’s presence among the Thessalonians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διεμαρτυράμεθα</span>] an intensifying of <span class="greekheb">προείπομεν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>. Compare the saying of rabbi Simon ben Zoma (on <a href="/deuteronomy/23-25.htm" title="When you come into the standing corn of your neighbor, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing corn.">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>): “Look not on thy neighbour’s vineyard.

But if thou hast eaten, then thou dost eject thyself from the life of this world and of that which is to come” (quoted in Bacher’s <span class="ital">Agada der Tannaiten</span>, 2nd ed., 1903, i. 430). There is no change of subject, from licentiousness to dishonesty. The asyndeton and the euphemistic <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ πράγματι</span> (not <span class="greekheb">τῳ</span> = <span class="greekheb">τινί</span>, Win. § 6 4<span class="ital">d</span>) show that Paul is still dealing with the immorality of men, but now as a form of social dishonesty and fraud. The metaphors are drawn from trade, perhaps as appropriate to a trading community. While <span class="greekheb">ὑπερβαίνειν</span> may be intransitive (in its classical sense of “transgress”), it probably governs <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφόν</span> in the sense of “get the better of,” or “overreach;” <span class="greekheb">πλεονεκτεῖν</span> similarly = “overreach,” “defraud,” “take advantage of” (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?...">2 Corinthians 12:17-18</a>; Xen., <span class="ital">Mem.</span>, iii. 5, 2; Herod. viii. 112).

The passage (with <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>) sounds almost like a vague reminiscence of Test.

Acts of Impurity are <span class="ital">social</span> wrongs, as well as sins against the offender’s person. The warning may include any injury done to another touching the affections and engagements that belong to marriage,—“the matter” concerned in the present charge—which is expressly violated by “fornication.” The Apostle sets the wrong in the strongest light: it is to “cheat one’s brother,” and that in what touches most nearly the sanctities of life. Hence the stern warning that follows:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because that the Lord is the avenger of all such</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">an avenger</span>; and <span class="bld">concerning all these things</span>—in everything that concerns the honour of the human person and the sacredness of wedded life.
