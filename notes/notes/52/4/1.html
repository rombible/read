The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Furthermore then - &#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;  To loipon.

The oldest manuscripts add a clause here, "even as also ye do walk" (compare 1Th 4:10; 5:11). These words, which he was able to say of them with truth, conciliate a favorable hearing for the precepts which follow.

Or request of you in the most kind and tender manner, from real and hearty love and affection for you, and with a view to your good, and the glory of God: <p>and exhort you: or beseech and entreat you. The apostle does not lay his commands upon them as he might have done, and sometimes does, but endeavours to work upon them by way of entreaty, and which he doubtless thought the most effectual method to win upon them, and gain them; for some minds are more easily wrought upon by entreaty than by authority: and this he does in the most moving and powerful manner, even <p>by the Lord Jesus; or "in the Lord Jesus"; in his name and stead, as personating him, and as though he did beseech and entreat them by him, and his fellow ministers; or for his sake, intimating, that if they had any regard to him, any value for his name, if that had any weight with them, or they had any concern for his honour and interest, then he begs their attention to the following exhortation; or by the Lord Jesus, by all that is in him, or done for them by him; in whom they were chosen, by whom they were redeemed, in whom they were made new creatures, to whose image they were to be conformed, whose followers they professed to be, whose Gospel they embraced, and by whose name they were called. <p>That as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk, and to please God. The walk of believers is twofold, either internal or external. Their internal walk is by faith, which is the going out of the soul by faith to Christ for every supply of grace. Their external walk is not as it was before conversion, according to the course of this world, or as other Gentiles walk, but in a holy religious life and conversation; and this requires spiritual life, strength and direction from Christ; for neither dead men, nor, if alive, yet weak, can walk; nor is it in a spiritual man, that walketh to direct his steps; and such a walk also denotes continuance, in well doing, and a progression or going on in it, and supposes ways to walk in. Christ, he is the chief and principal way, and there are other paths which regard him, or relate and lead unto him; as the way of truth, the path of ordinances, and of religious worship, both public and private, and the ways of righteousness, holiness, and good works: the manner in which saints are to walk is as Christ himself walked, after the Spirit, and not after the flesh, according to the rule of the word, which is the standard of faith and practice, with prudence, wisdom, circumspection, and worthy of God, and of that calling wherein they are called: and of such a walk there is a necessity; it "ought", it must be both on the account of God, it being his will, and for his glory, and the contrary would show great ingratitude to him; and on the account of the saints themselves, to adorn them, and their profession, and preserve them from shame and disgrace, to show their faith, and demonstrate their calling and election to others; and likewise on account of others, partly for the winning of some, by recommending in this way the Gospel to them, and partly for the bringing of others to shame and silence, who falsely accuse their good conversation. Now when the apostle, and those that were with him, were at Thessalonica, they gave these saints directions and instructions about their walk and conversation, to order it in such a manner as might "please God"; which is not to be understood of rendering their persons acceptable to God hereby, for the saints' acceptance with God is only in Christ the beloved; nor of their gaining the love and favour of God by such means, for the love of God is from everlasting, and is free, and sovereign, and does not arise from, or depend upon the holiness and obedience of men; or of making peace with God by such a walk, for peace is only made by the blood of Christ; but of doing those things, and in such a way God approves of: unregenerate men cannot please God, nor anything they do, because they are destitute of the Spirit of God, and are without Christ, and his grace and have not faith in him, without which it is impossible to please God; but what a believer does in faith, from a principle of love, in the name and strength of Christ, and to the glory of God, is approved of by God, and is acceptable to him through Christ, and for his sake; and there are many things of this kind, as prayer, praise, acts of beneficence to the poor, and indeed every good work and holy action: and inasmuch as they had been thus taught and instructed how to behave and conduct in their outward walk and conversation, they are entreated and exhorted to go on and abound in the work of the Lord: <p>so ye would abound more and more: that is, be more and more in the exercise of every grace, and in the discharge of every duty, making advances in holiness of life, and perfecting it in the fear of God. Beza's ancient copy, and another manuscript, as also the Alexandrian copy, and some others, add between the preceding, and this last clause, "as ye also walk"; and so the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions seem to have read; commending them for their present and past walk and conversation, in order to persuade and encourage them to go forward. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Furthermore <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <i>you</i> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <i>so</i> ye would <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> abound more and more.</span><p>(1) Various exhortations, the foundation of which is this, to be mindful of those things which they have heard from the apostle.<p>(a) That you labour to excel more and more, and daily surpass yourselves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ λοιπόν</span> (see critical remark) would now directly oppose what follows with what precedes: “for the rest,” “what is yet besides to be said;” whereas <span class="greekheb">λοιπόν</span> is a less prominent particle of transition—“besides.” Both forms, however, introduce something different from what precedes, and serve properly to introduce the concluding remarks of an Epistle; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell.

Beside the doctrine of the Gospel the apostles taught its practice—what men should do and what should be the “work” and effect of their faith (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>), as well as what they should believe. In their earliest lessons the Thessalonians had received the moral along with the theological elements of Christianity,—“how you <span class="ital">ought to walk</span>.” On this last word comp. note to ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Ought to walk <span class="ital">and</span> please God” is not the same as “walk <span class="ital">so as to</span> please God,” though this Is implied; but rather “how you ought to walk, and ought to please God.” The <span class="ital">duty of pleasing God</span> had been a subject of St Paul’s admonitions, and he had set all other duties in this light. Similarly in ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a> he spoke of himself and Silas as governed in their work by the thought of “pleasing God,” while in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a> the condemnation of the Jews was found in the fact that they were “not pleasing God.” Our conduct is always, and in everything, pleasing or displeasing to Him; and the religious man finds in this the highest sanction of right-doing. The word Sanctification (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>) expresses in another way the same religious necessity attaching to moral obligation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The clause <span class="bld">even as ye do walk</span> is restored to the text by the Revisers, on the best authority.

The Apostle would not appear to censure his readers. He is sure that they <span class="ital">are</span> walking in the true path, mindful of his instructions; he wishes to keep them in it, and to urge them forward.

For the Apostle has accomplished the chief objects with which he began to write,—viz. to assure his readers of the intense interest he takes in their welfare, to express his sympathy with them under their persecutions, and to explain how it was that he had not himself returned to them. But he cannot let the occasion pass without adding counsel and exhortation on certain subjects in which the Thessalonian Church was specially in need of guidance. Chief amongst these were the misunderstandings that had arisen touching the <span class="ital">parousia</span>, or second advent of Christ (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a> to <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" title="Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>). But before he deals with this topic, there are a few things he wishes to say to them about <span class="ital">morals</span> and matters of <span class="ital">conduct toward each other</span>, which we have before us in this Section. It is significant that the Apostle puts these things first in his exhortation, although the question of the Parousia was of such absorbing interest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The topics embraced in this Section are (1) and chiefly, that of <span class="ital">chastity</span> and <span class="ital">the sanctification of the body, <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:...">1 Thessalonians 4:3-8</a></span>; (2) <span class="ital">brotherly love, <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another....">1 Thessalonians 4:9-10</a></span>; (3) <span class="ital">diligence</span> in secular work, <span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm" title="And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;...">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That chaps, 4, 5 form an addendum, supplementing the primary intention of the Epistle, is shown by the introductory phrase:—<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀρέσκειν</span>, <span class="ital">to please, to show yourselves pleasing, acceptable</span>) to the Lord.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Furthermore</span>; literally, <span class="accented">finally</span>; <span class="accented">for the rest - introducing</span> the closing or practical part of the Epistle.
