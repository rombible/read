The rule according to which all ought to walk and act, is the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification, in the renewal of their souls under the influences of the Holy Spirit, and attention to appointed duties, constituted the will of God respecting them. In aspiring after this renewal of the soul unto holiness, strict restraint must be put upon the appetites and senses of the body, and on the thoughts and inclinations of the will, which lead to wrong uses of them. The Lord calls none into his family to live unholy lives, but that they may be taught and enabled to walk before him in holiness. Some make light of the precepts of holiness, because they hear them from men; but they are God's commands, and to break them is to despise God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He therefore that despiseth - Margin, "rejecteth." That is, he who disregards such commands as these which call him to a holy life, is really rejecting and disobeying God.

The apostle assures them in the most solemn manner, that, though communicated to them by man, yet they were really the commands of God.<p>Who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit - This is a claim to inspiration.

He who doth so, "sets at naught not man (as for instance his brother), but God" (Ps 51:4) is used of despising or rejecting God's minister, it may mean here, "He who despiseth" or "rejecteth" these our ministerial precepts.<p>who hath also given unto us&#8212;So some oldest manuscripts read, but most oldest manuscripts read, "Who (without 'also') giveth (present) unto you" (not "us").<p>his Spirit&#8212;Greek, "His own Spirit, the Holy (One)"; thus emphatically marking "holiness" (1Th 4:7) as the end for which the Holy (One) is being given. "Unto you," in the Greek, implies that the Spirit is being given unto, into (put "into" your hearts), and among you (compare 1Th 2:9; Eph 4:30). "Giveth" implies that sanctification is not merely a work once for all accomplished in the past, but a present progressive work. So the Church of England Catechism, "sanctifieth (present) all the elect people of God." "His own" implies that as He gives you that which is essentially identical with Himself, He expects you should become like Himself (1Pe 1:16; 2Pe 1:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He therefore that despiseth,.... The Vulgate Latin adds, "these things"; these exhortations now delivered, the commandments given by the Lord Jesus Christ, and the will of God above declared; he that rejects these things with contempt, takes no notice of them, and acts not according to them, <p>despiseth not man; not men only, the apostles of Christ, and ministers of the Gospel; for, by despising these exhortations, they themselves were despised, though not alone: but God; Father, Son, and Spirit; God the Father, whose will was their sanctification, even to abstain from fornication, and every act of uncleanness, which, if not attended to, was a despising of him; and the Lord Jesus Christ, by whom, and for whose sake they were entreated and exhorted, and in whose name, and by whose authority the apostle gave them these commandments; wherefore to slight them, was to slight Jesus Christ himself; and, by the way, this is a proof of the true and proper deity of Christ. Moreover, such despisers also, in some sense, do despite unto the spirit of grace, by whom the apostles spake, or who spoke in them these things, as follows, <p>who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit; as he did to the prophets of the Old Testament, and therefore what they said was equally by divine inspiration of God; and hence despising them, was despising the Spirit of God that spake by them. The Syriac and Arabic versions read, "who hath given unto you his Holy Spirit"; and so all Stephens's copies; which furnishes out a fresh reason or argument, dissuading from uncleanness, since God had given them his "Spirit" to convince them of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, so that they were not ignorant of the things warned against; and he had given them his Spirit as an "holy" Spirit, as a Spirit of sanctification, to begin and carry on that work in them, to which uncleanness was very opposite; and he had given his Spirit unto, or "into" them, to dwell in them, as in his temple, and therefore should be careful not to defile it; and to cause them to walk in his statutes, and to assist them to keep his judgments, and do them, and as an earnest of their inheritance, and a sealer of them up unto the day of redemption; wherefore it became them not to grieve him by an impure life; and they were laid under obligations to live in the Spirit, and to walk after him, and not after the flesh. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He therefore that <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</span><p>(c) These commandments which I gave you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>.

Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>; <a href="/acts/5-4.htm" title="Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.">Acts 5:4</a>; Winer, p. 440 [E.

In such a case they would not only set at nought the eternal will of God, but also repay the great grace which God had shown to them with shameful ingratitude. <span class="greekheb">καί</span> has an intensifying force, and brings prominently forward, by an appeal to the conscience of the readers, the inexcusableness of such conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ τὸ ἅγιον</span>] is the Holy Spirit proceeding from God, who transforms the believer into a new personality, and produces extraordinary capabilities and gifts (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a> f.; 1 Corinthians 12-14).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑμᾶς</span>] is not precisely equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> (Koppe, Flatt, Pelt), but denotes, instead of the mere logical relation which the dative expresses, the communication under the form of locality; accordingly, unto you.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If the present tense <span class="greekheb">διδόντα</span> is read, the communication of the Holy Spirit is represented as something continuing in the present. If, along with <span class="greekheb">διδόντα</span>, the reading of the <span class="ital">Receptus</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμᾶς</span>, is retained, this may be either taken in a wide sense, as <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm" title="For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>, “to us, Christians;” or, in a narrow sense, “to us (me) the apostle.” In the first case, the addition on account of its generality would be somewhat aimless. In the second case, the following thought might be found therein: “but God, who not only commissions us to utter such exhortations, but who has also imparted to us His Holy Spirit, put us in a position to speak every moment the correct thing;” comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm" title="But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But (1) this view is objectionable on account of the many additions and supplements which it requires; (2) <span class="greekheb">τὸν καὶ διδόντα</span> would introduce no new thought which is not already contained in the contrast <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἄνθρωπον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τὸν Θεόν</span>; for, being commissioned by God to give such exhortations, speaking in His name is one and the same with being qualified for this purpose by God’s Holy Spirit; (3) Lastly, it is generally improbable that the addition <span class="greekheb">τὸν καὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. should contain a statement concerning the apostle, as such a statement is too little occasioned by the preceding. For, in the contrast <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἄνθρωπον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τὸν Θεόν</span>, the general idea <span class="ital">not man</span> is contained in <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπον</span> as the <span class="ital">main</span> point, whilst the reference to the apostle’s own person in <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπον</span> is very slight, and forms only a <span class="ital">subsidiary</span> point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If, on the other hand, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑμᾶς</span> be received along with the present participle, this might be explained with de Wette, whom Koch follows, that the apostle for the sake of strengthening his words reminds the Thessalonians how God still continues to communicate to them His Holy Spirit; how this communicated Holy Spirit, partly by inspired persons, partly by the voice of conscience, gives the same exhortations which he, Paul, now enforces. But who does not see that here also the chief matter, by which the addition becomes appropriate, must first be introduced and supplied?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>.

It was God’s call which had summoned the Thessalonians to their new life; His voice, not man’s, had reached them by the Gospel (see ch. <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory....">1 Thessalonians 2:12-13</a>). It will be <span class="ital">God’s</span> authority therefore, not man’s, that they defy, if this charge is disregarded; comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>, “how you ought to please God;” and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>, “This is God’s will.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the God Whom they would thus set at nought, is <span class="bld">He who gives His Holy Spirit unto you</span>. The Greek text of this clause is doubtful in several points. The Revisers are probably right in reading <span class="ital">giveth</span> in place of <span class="ital">hath also given</span> (A. V.); and <span class="ital">you</span> in place of <span class="ital">us</span> (A. V.), this word closing the sentence with emphasis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The preposition is strictly <span class="bld">into you</span>, implying beyond the mere fact of the impartation of the Holy Spirit, His <span class="ital">entrance into</span> the soul. There is probably a reminiscence of <a href="/ezekiel/37-6.htm" title="And I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 37:6</a>, where the LXX represents the Lord as saying to the dry bones, “I will <span class="ital">give</span> (Hebrew, <span class="ital">put</span>) My Spirit into you, and you shall live, and shall know that I am the Lord.” Similarly in <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>, “God sent forth the Spirit of His Son <span class="ital">into</span> your hearts;” and in <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>, “strengthened through His Spirit (entering) <span class="ital">into</span> the inward man.” The gift of the Holy Spirit of God, bestowed to dwell within the soul of him who believes in Christ, is the peculiar distinction and the essential blessing of Christ’s religion. “I will pray the Father,” said Jesus, “and He will give you another Paraclete, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth. He abideth with you, and shall be in you” (<a href="/context/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;...">John 14:16-17</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>). The whole grace of the Gospel is summed up by St Paul in “the promise of the Spirit,” received “through faith” (<a href="/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>). Through His indwelling we know the love of God, and are conscious of being sons of God and heirs of life eternal (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>; <a href="/context/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God....">Romans 8:14-17</a>; <a href="/context/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father....">Galatians 4:6-7</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,...">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now the unchaste act or thought is an affront to the Holy Ghost, Who dwells as Guest in the soul and body of the Christian. This final warning seals the Apostle’s charge. He appeals to the presence of the Holy Spirit, of Whose continued visitations and influence his readers were sensible. To “reject the God Who gives” this gift would be for the Thessalonians to sin against the light that was in them. We are reminded again of <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>, “Know you not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost Which is in you, Which you have from God?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Gentle, awful, holy Guest,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Make Thy temple in each breast,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There supreme to reign and rest,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Comforter Divine.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἀθετῶν</span>) <span class="ital">he who despiseth</span> this thing.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν καὶ δόντα</span>, <span class="ital">Who has also given</span>) The word <span class="ital">also</span> intimates that a new importance is here added to what immediately precedes.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ Πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ τὸ ἅγιον εἰς ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">His Holy Spirit to you</span>) <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>.[13]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[13] <span class="greekheb">Ὑμᾶς</span> is the reading of BDG<span class="ital">fg</span>: “in vobis” is that of <span class="ital">g</span> and Vulg.; but <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> of A and Rec.

The best manuscripts, however, read, "who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you" (R.V.) - a strong enforcement of holiness, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit was given them for the express purpose of producing holiness within them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Despiseth (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, rejecteth.
