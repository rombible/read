Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But even after that we had suffered before - Before we came among you.<p>And were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi - <a href="/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a> ff. By being beaten and cast into prison. The shame of the treatment consisted in the fact that it was wholly undeserved; that it was contrary to the laws; and that it was accompanied with circumstances designed to make their punishment as ignominious as possible. The Thessalonians knew of this, and Paul was not disposed to palliate the conduct of the Philippians. What was "shameful treatment" he speaks of as such without hesitation. It is not wrong to call things by their right names, and when we have been abused, it is not necessary that we should attempt to smooth the matter over by saying that it was not so.<p>We were bold in our God - By humble dependence on the support of our God. It was only his powerful aid that could have enabled them to persevere with ardor and zeal in such a work after such treatment The meaning here is, that they were not deterred from preaching the gospel by the treatment which they had received, but at the very next important town, and on the first opportunity, they proclaimed the same truth, though there was no security that they might not meet with the same persecution there. Paul evidently appeals to this in order to show them that they were not impostors, and that they were not influenced by the hope of ease or of selfish gains. People who were not sincere and earnest in their purposes would have been deterred by such treatment as they had received at Philippi.<p>With much contention - Amidst much opposition, and where great effort was necessary. The Greek word here used is &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;  ago&#772;ni (agony), a word referring usually to the Grecian games; notes, <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>. It means the course, or place of contest; and then the contest itself, the strife, the combat, the effort for victory; and the apostle here means, that owing to the opposition there, there was need of an effort on his part like the desperate struggles of those who contended for the mastery at the Grecian games; compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>. The triumph of the gospel there was secured only by an effort of the highest kind, and by overcoming the most formidable opposition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. even after that we had suffered before&#8212;at Philippi (Ac 16:11-40): a circumstance which would have deterred mere natural, unspiritual men from further preaching.<p>shamefully entreated&#8212;ignominiously scourged (Ac 16:22, 23).<p>bold&#8212;(Ac 4:29; Eph 6:20).<p>in our God&#8212;The ground of our boldness in speaking was the realization of God as "OUR God."<p>with much contention&#8212;that is, literally, as of competitors in a contest: striving earnestness (Col 1:29; 2:1).

And what he speaks would savour of vain-glory, but that he had therein a holy end; as he excuseth his boasting to the Corinthians and other churches upon the same account.

Before they came to Thessalonica, which they would not have done, had their ministry been a light and empty one in itself, and unprofitable to others; and especially had this been the case, they would never have rashly engaged in it again, and exposed themselves to fresh sufferings and dangers, as they did: <p>and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi; being beaten with many stripes, and put into prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks, at the instigation of the masters of the damsel that had a spirit of divination, by whom they got much gain, and which Paul dispossessed; see <a href="/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a><p>we were bold in our God to speak unto you the Gospel of God with much contention: and which still made it more manifestly appear, that the errand they came upon was a matter of importance, and that they did not proceed on a slight foundation: what they spoke was "the Gospel", salvation by Christ, and not by the works of the law; the pure Gospel, and not a mixed one, free from the mixture of all human doctrines and inventions of men, without any adulteration and inconsistency; the whole of the Gospel, and not a part of it only; they declared the whole counsel of God, and kept back nothing that might be profitable: and this is styled the Gospel of God, to distinguish it from the Gospel of men, or that which the false teachers taught, and which was called the Gospel, though it was not so; and to express the excellency of it, from the author of it, who is God, it being the produce of his wisdom and grace; and from the matter of it, it containing the good will of God to men, setting forth the grace of God in election, redemption, justification, pardon, adoption, regeneration, and glorification, and expressing things relating to the kingdom of God, a meetness for it, and a right unto it; and it being so called shows it to be something divine, a message sent from God to sinful men; and gives a reason why the apostles were so bold to speak it, because it was not of men, but God. The Syriac version renders it the "Gospel of Christ"; see <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a> and it being so, they "were bold to speak it"; or they spoke it both with liberty of mind, the Spirit of God being with them, and with freedom of speech, a door of utterance being opened for them; as also with great courage and intrepidity, notwithstanding what they had suffered before, and the ill treatment they had met with at Philippi; and though they knew that the Gospel they spoke was contrary to the Jews, was a stumblingblock to them, and they had an inveterate prejudice against it; and was foolishness to the Greeks, and was derided by them, and they were sure to meet with reproach and persecution on account of it: yet they boldly and faithfully preached it, fearing not the face of men, nor their revilings: though it was <p>with much contention; referring to the tumult raised by the baser sort, who, instigated by others, assaulted Jason and the brethren, where the apostles were, <a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> or to the disputes which they had with the unbelieving Jews, who contradicted and blasphemed what they said; or to the division the Gospel made, as through the corruption of nature it makes wherever it comes, between the nearest relations and friends, some being for it, and others against it; or this may be expressive of the zeal with which the apostles preached, who earnestly contended for it, as persons in a combat or agony; they fought the good fight of faith valiantly, they endured hardness as good soldiers of Christ, and gave not way to the enemy, no, not for an hour: and all this was "in our God"; or "by the confidence" of our God, as the Syriac version renders it; trusting in him and relying upon him, being assisted by his grace, and strengthened by his power, and receiving much encouragement from a view of him as a covenant God; faith in God as a covenant God, will make a man bold in his cause; see <a href="/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</span><p>(2) The virtues of a true pastor are freely without fear to preach the Gospel, even in the midst of dangers.<p>(a) Through God's gracious help.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>.

Moreover, <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> is the usual form; and therefore, although <span class="greekheb">Θεῷ</span> precedes, <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγέλιον αὐτοῦ</span> is not put.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πολλῷ ἀγῶνι</span>] <span class="ital">in much contention</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγών</span> is to be understood neither of the cares and anxieties of the apostle (Fritzsche), nor of his diligence and zeal (Moldenhauer), but of external conflicts and dangers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>. “Though we had suffered—aye and suffered outrage” in one town, yet on we went to another with the same errand; a practical illustration of <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm" title="But when they persecute you in this city, flee you into another: for truly I say to you, You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.">Matthew 10:23</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi</span>] More exactly, <span class="bld">having suffered before</span>, <span class="bld">and been shamefully entreated</span> (R. V.), or <span class="bld">though we had already suffered and were shamefully treated at Philippi</span>. “Entreated” is older English for <span class="ital">treated</span>, as in <a href="/matthew/22-6.htm" title="And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.">Matthew 22:6</a> and <a href="/luke/18-32.htm" title="For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:">Luke 18:32</a> (<span class="ital">spitefully entreated</span>). <span class="ital">Shamefully treated</span> is one word in the Greek,—<span class="ital">outraged</span>. It implies insult and injury combined, such as constituted a legal crime. This accords with the protest of Paul and Silas against the Philippian magistrates (<a href="/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>): “They have beaten us, publicly, uncondemned, being Romans!” Such indignities the Apostle felt keenly; they added a distinct element to his sufferings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the circumstances of the missionaries’ visit to Philippi and their experience there, read carefully Acts 16, and comp. <span class="ital">Introd.</span> Chap. II. “As ye know,” for the Apostle had doubtless told his Thessalonian friends of his treatment at Philippi. Moreover, this town was but three days’ journey east of Thessalonica along the Via Egnatia, and news of all kinds readily passed between them (<span class="ital">Introd.</span> Chap. I.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of being daunted by the violence they suffered, Paul and Silas at Philippi “sang praises to God at midnight, with their feet fast in the stocks.” And God there signally vindicated His servants and turned their shame to honour. So we are not surprised to read of the holy confidence with which they declared their message at Thessalonica: <span class="bld">we waxed bold</span> (R. V.)—or, <span class="bld">took courage in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God amid much conflict</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last words of the clause explain the first, on which the emphasis rests. The “conflict” that broke out at Philippi continued under another form at Thessalonica, and the apostles needed all their courage and faith in God to sustain them in entering on their ministry in this new city. Throughout this first European mission it required a hard struggle to win for the Gospel a footing anywhere. There was <span class="ital">much conflict</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Greek verb (<span class="ital">waxed-bold</span>) implies the undaunted bearing and address of the missionaries, the <span class="ital">outspokenness</span> with which they faced their opposers in the delivery of God’s message. This was more than natural courage: “we waxed bold <span class="ital">in our God</span>.” God’s presence and the consciousness that His Spirit was with them (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>, see note) made them fearless. “It is not ye that speak,” said Jesus, “but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you … Fear them not therefore” (<a href="/context/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves....">Matthew 10:16-32</a>). Besides, it was “the gospel <span class="ital">of God</span>” which they proclaimed: God had put the message into their lips. This is the secret of St Paul’s heroism. The highest moral courage, such as that of President Lincoln or General Gordon in modern times, springs from faith in God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The evangelists addressed themselves to their work at Thessalonica with a high degree of confidence, and under the fullest sense of Divine direction. Contrast with this the “weakness and fear and much trembling in” which the Apostle shortly afterwards “was with” the Corinthians (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling....">1 Corinthians 2:3-5</a>). St Paul’s mood as a preacher was not always the same; circumstances depressed or elated him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προπαθόντες</span>, <span class="ital">having suffered before</span>) that which might have deterred others from preaching.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated.</span> As the word here rendered "suffered before" does not in itself imply that the sufferings were unjust, the apostle adds, "and were shamefully entreated." <span class="cmt_word">As ye know, at Philippi.</span> We are informed, in the Acts of the Apostles, that Paul and Silas were publicly scourged and cast into prison; and scourging with rods was regarded as an ignominious punishment, and therefore was forbidden to be inflicted on Roman citizens, such as Paul and Silas were.
