Paul, </span>not as if it were a great thing that one like <span class= "ital">him</span> should have such a wish, but showing that Silas and Timothy had not shared his intention. Why had they not? The answer shows the minute truthfulness of the Acts. Timothy, apparently, did not at first <span class= "ital">leave</span> Thessalonica with St. Paul (<a href="/acts/17-10.htm" title="And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.">Acts 17:10</a>, where the Greek seems definitely to exclude him). Both Silas and Timothy were left at Berœa (<a href="/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>). It was during this period that St. Paul felt so eager a desire to return to his persecuted children. We cannot tell on what two definite occasions the desire was almost taking shape; but possibly his longing may have been stimulated by seeing his messengers start for the north, first when he sent for his two companions (<a href="/acts/17-15.htm" title="And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.">Acts 17:15</a>), and secondly when he despatched Timothy himself to Thessalonica (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1Thessalonians 3:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">But Satan hindered.</span>—How, cannot be decided; but St. Paul has no doubt that his disappointment was a direct manifestation of the work of evil, not a leading of God to stay where he was. Elsewhere he is quite as clear that the obstruction of his own plans is owing to God. (See <a href="/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6-7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>, where the will spoken of is not Apollos’ will, but God’s.) The difficulty is to tell in each case whether God is directly saving us from a worse course, in spite of ourselves, or permitting a momentary, and yet if rightly used a disciplinary, triumph of evil.<p><span class= "bld">Satan.</span>—The Thessalonians, though originally Gentiles, had doubtless been taught enough at their conversion to recognise the word. Though it is quite clear from other passages (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-7.htm" title="Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.">1Timothy 3:7</a>) that St. Paul believed in the existence of personal fallen spirits, it cannot be positively affirmed that he <span class= "ital">here</span> means anything more than a <span class= "ital">personification</span> of all that is opposed to God—the hostility of wicked men, &c.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:17-20 This world is not a place where we are to be always, or long together. In heaven holy souls shall meet, and never part more. And though the apostle could not come to them yet, and thought he might never be able to come, yet our Lord Jesus Christ will come; nothing shall hinder that. May God give faithful ministers to all who serve him with their spirit in the gospel of his Son, and send them to all who are in darkness<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul - The phrase "even I Paul," seems to be used by way of emphasis. He had a special desire to go himself. He had sent Timothy to them <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>, and perhaps, some might have been disposed to allege that Paul was afraid to go himself, or that he did not feel interest enough in them to go, though he was willing to send one to visit them. Paul, therefore, is at much pains to assure them that his long separation from them was unavoidable.<p>But Satan hindered us - Compare the notes on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>. In what way this was done is unknown, and conjecture would be useless. The apostle recognized the hand of Satan in frustrating his attempt to do good, and preventing the accomplishment of his strong desire to see his Christian friends. In the obstacles, therefore, to the performance of our duty, and in the hindrances of our enjoyment, it is not improper to trace the hand of the great enemy of good. The agency of Satan may, for aught we can tell, often be employed in the embarrassments that we meet with in life. The hindrances which we meet with in our efforts to do good, when the providence of God seems to favor us, and his word and Spirit seem to call us to a particular duty, often look very much like the work of Satan. They are just such obstructions as a very wicked being would be glad to throw in our way. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. Wherefore&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "Because," or "Inasmuch as."<p>we would&#8212;Greek, "we wished to come"; we intended to come.<p>even I Paul&#8212;My fellow missionaries as well as myself wished to come; I can answer for myself that I intended it more than once. His slightly distinguishing himself here from his fellow missionaries, whom throughout this Epistle he associates with himself in the plural, accords with the fact that Silvanus and Timothy stayed at Berea when Paul went on to Athens; where subsequently Timothy joined him, and was thence sent by Paul alone to Thessalonica (1Th 3:1).<p>Satan hindered us&#8212;On a different occasion "the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Jesus" (so the oldest manuscripts read), Ac 16:6, 7, forbad or hindered them in a missionary design; here it is Satan, acting perhaps by wicked men, some of whom had already driven him out of Thessalonica (Ac 17:13, 14; compare Joh 13:27), or else by some more direct "messenger of Satan&#8212;a thorn in the flesh" (2Co 12:7; compare 2Co 11:14). In any event, the Holy Ghost and the providence of God overruled Satan's opposition to further His own purpose. We cannot, in each case, define whence hindrances in good undertakings arise; Paul in this case, by inspiration, was enabled to say; the hindrance was from Satan. Grotius thinks Satan's mode of hindering Paul's journey to Thessalonica was by instigating the Stoic and Epicurean philosophers to cavil, which entailed on Paul the necessity of replying, and so detained him; but he seems to have left Athens leisurely (Ac 17:33, 34; 18:1). The Greek for "hindered" is literally, "to cut a trench between one's self and an advancing foe, to prevent his progress"; so Satan opposing the progress of the missionaries.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This he adds further to satisfy them of his real affection to them, that he attempted to come to them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">once and again, </span> that is, often, as <span class="bld"><a href="/nehemiah/13-20.htm" title="So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.">Nehemiah 13:20</a> <a href="/philippians/4-16.htm" title="For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.">Philippians 4:16</a></span>. And that they might be assured it was not his fellow ministers’ desire only to come, therefore he expresseth his own name particularly in a parenthesis (<span class="bld">even I Paul</span>).

Or by what way it was, is somewhat uncertain; but being thus hindered it made his desire the more fervent by the opposition. And hereby we see Satan’s enmity to the gospel, especially to churches newly planted, that they might not take rooting. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore we would have come unto you,.... They not only had a will, and purposed in themselves, and entered into some resolutions to come unto them, but endeavoured to put them into execution: <p>even I:Paul: as well as Silas and Timothy; the latter of which had been with them, and the others had as good a will, and especially Paul: and that <p>once and again: or "once and twice" so the Jews used (h) to speak  , "one time and a second"; that is, several times: <p>but Satan hindered us. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions read, "hindered me"; by moving the mob which rose at Thessalonica, to go to Berea, and disturb the apostle there; which obliged him, contrary to his will, to go to Athens instead of returning to Thessalonica, as he intended; and when at Athens, from whence also he might purpose to return thither, he was hindered by the disputes the Jews and the Stoics, and Epicurean philosophers, had with him; and after that, might be prevented by the lying in wait of the Jews for him, of which he might be informed; or by disturbances raised in the church, or churches where he was, by the false teachers; which required his stay with them, to oppose and refute error and heresy and to make up differences that arose among true Christians, fomented by Satan and his emissaries; see <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>. Satan does all he can to hinder the preaching of the Gospel, the hearing of the word, the profession of religion, and the saints coming together, and having spiritual conversation with each other; being, as his name "Satan" signifies, an enemy to Christ and his interest, and to the souls of men: indeed he can do nothing but by divine permission, nor can he hinder the will of God, and the execution of that, though he often hinders the will of man, or man from doing his will; he hindered the apostle from doing what he willed and purposed, but he did not hinder the will of God, which was that Paul should be employed in other work elsewhere. <p>(h) Maimon. in Hilch.

Satan prevented us from coming, in order to rob us of our glory and praise on the last day, by wrecking your Christian faith; he was jealous of our success among you.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[32]<span class="ital"> Encyclopædia Biblica</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore we would have come unto you</span>] The true reading is <span class="bld">because</span>—not “wherefore,” due probably to a misunderstanding of the following verb, which is not removed by the rendering of the R. V., “because we <span class="ital">would fain</span> have come.” This but repeats the “great desire” just expressed; whereas the Greek verb implies <span class="ital">resolution</span> rather than inclination. The Apostle, as we understand him, is giving the explanation of his strenuous endeavours (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>), lying behind them in his <span class="ital">determined will</span>—<span class="bld">because we had resolved to come to you</span>: “we had set our minds upon it.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even I Paul</span>] Better, <span class="bld">I Paul, for my part</span>. He speaks for himself: Timothy did return after a time (ch. <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;...">1 Thessalonians 3:1-2</a>); and Silas had been left behind in Macedonia (<a href="/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>; <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>). Paul had not come at all; but it was not for want of will.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the Apostle had made up his mind to this more than once—<span class="bld">both once and twice</span>. Silas had, no doubt, shared in the wish and endeavour to return <span class="ital">from Berœa</span>; the second attempt, likewise frustrated, was made by the Apostle alone, <span class="ital">from Athens</span> (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>). The expression recurs in <a href="/philippians/4-16.htm" title="For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.">Php 4:16</a>. Compare with the whole statement <a href="/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a> : “Many times I purposed to come to you, and have been hindered hitherto.” The Apostle’s prophetic gift did not save him from the discipline of disappointment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but Satan hindered us</span>] Properly, <span class="bld">and Satan, &c</span>.: “but” would be the regular conjunction here; there is a slight dislocation of structure in the sentence, due to excited feeling. We may paraphrase the sentence thus: <span class="bld">We strove eagerly to find means of coming to see you; indeed, for my part, I had made up my mind to do it more than once; and our way was blocked, by Satan</span>! What form the hindrance took we can only guess. Jewish malice doubtless had much to do with it. But behind this baffling and unforeseen combination of circumstances the Apostle discerned the craft of the Arch-enemy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Satan</span>] i.e. “the Adversary,” is the O.T. name of the Leader of evil spirits, the great enemy of God and man—called also “the Devil” (Slanderer), “the Evil One” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>), and “the Tempter” (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>). Satan is, throughout the New Testament, a real personality, and no figure of speech. See note on <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; and comp. <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To account for his intense longing to see the Thessalonians, St Paul describes his interest in them in the glowing terms that follow:—<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm" title="Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἅπαξ καὶ δὶς</span>) So the LXX. <a href="/nehemiah/13-20.htm" title="So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.">Nehemiah 13:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ Σατανᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">Satan</span>) Paul wisely considered that there lurked beneath this the first cause of evil—a cause, of which we should have had no suspicion otherwise, when reading the history in <a href="/context/acts/17-13.htm" title="But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people....">Acts 17:13-14</a>.

Paul here recognizes the personality of Satan, as the author of all evil, the great opponent of God and Christ. We are not informed by what instrumentality this hindrance of Satan took place. It may refer to the various persecutions against Paul, which prevented him returning to Thessalonica, and especially to that persecution raised against him in Beraea by the Jews of Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>). In one sense, indeed, the hindrances arose in the way of God's providence, for under its direction all the journeys of Paul were placed, and Satan could not have hindered him from preaching the gospel in any quarter, unless by the Divine permission (comp. <a href="/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>; <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We would (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Implying more than a mere inclination or desire.

In lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is used, almost without exception, as the translation of the Hebrew Satan. Of 22 instances of &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; only 9 are outside of the book of Job. From the more general conception of an adversary, there is, in the O.T., a gradual development toward that of an evil personality. For instance, in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>, the numbering of the people is ascribed to the anger of the Lord. The later historian, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, ascribes the act to Satan. See also Job, Wisd. 2:24; <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm">Zechariah 3:1</a>. The specialising of the conception was due, in part, to the contact of the Jews with the religions of Babylon and Persia. In N.T. Satan appears as the personal spirit of evil - the same who is called the devil, the wicked one, the prince of the power of the air, the prince of this world, the serpent, the God of this world, the tempter. He tempts to evil, opposes God's work, inspires evil dispositions, torments God's people. The word Satan occurs only once in the Fourth Gospel, not in the Epistles, but often in Revelation. Mark never uses &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Matthew never Satan. Paul seldom &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, often Satan. Satan alone in Pastorals. Luke uses both. It is clear that Paul here as elsewhere employs the word in a personal sense; but any attempt to base the doctrine of a personal devil on this and similar passages is unsafe.<p>Hindered (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>. </body></html>
