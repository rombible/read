(2) to make them see still more deeply the value of their faith by the efforts made to keep it from them. Objection is often made to St. John’s Gospel on the ground that no born Jew could have written of “the Jews” in the bitter way so common in that book, or viewed them so completely as a separate body from himself. This passage, in an indubitable epistle of “a Hebrew of the Hebrews.” seems a satisfactory answer. The memories of St. Stephen’s speech (<a href="/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>) seem to be waking in the mind of him who was once a persecuting Jew himself.<p><span class= "bld">Have persecuted.</span>—Take the marginal version, “chased” (not <span class= "ital">“have</span> chased”) “us violently out of Thessalonica.”<p><span class= "bld">They please</span> <span class= "bld">not God</span>—(though to serve and please Him was the special purpose for which the nation was set apart, ) “and are at cross purposes with all mankind.” The historian Tacitus gives, as a characteristic of the race, “an attitude of hostility and hatred towards all others.” Juvenal makes the same accusation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:13-16 We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to its holiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle; but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God. Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who both killed the Lord Jesus - see the notes on <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>. The meaning here is, that it was characteristic of the Jews to be engaged in the work of persecution, and that they should not regard it as strange that they who had put their own Messiah to death, and slain the prophets, should now be found persecuting the true children of God.<p>And their own prophets - see the <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29-37</a> notes; <a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a> note.<p>And have persecuted us - As at Iconium <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>, Derbe, and Lystra <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/14-6.htm">Acts 14:6</a>, and at Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. The meaning is, that it was characteristic of them to persecute, and they spared no one. If they had persecuted the apostles themselves, who were their own countrymen, it should not be considered strange that they should persecute those who were Gentiles.<p>And they please not God - Their conduct is not such as to please God, but such as to expose them to his wrath; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>. The meaning is not that they did not aim to please God - whatever may have been the truth about that - but that they had shown by all their history that their conduct could not meet with the divine approbation. They made extraordinary pretensions to being the special people of God, and it was important for the apostle to show that their conduct demonstrated that they had no such claims. Their opposition to the Thessalonians, therefore, was no proof that God was opposed to them, and they should not allow themselves to be troubled by such opposition. It was rather proof that they were the friends of God - since those who now persecuted them had been engaged in persecuting the most holy people that had lived.<p>And are contrary to all men - They do not merely differ from other people in customs and opinions - which might be harmless - but they keep up an active opposition to all other people. It was not opposition to one nation only, but to all; it was not to one form of religion only, but to all - even including God's last revelation to mankind; it was not opposition evinced in their own country, but they carried it with them wherever they went. The truth of this statement is confirmed, not only by authority of the apostle and the uniform record in the New Testament, but by the testimony borne of them in the classic writers. This was universally regarded as their national characteristic, for they had so demeaned themselves as to leave this impression on the minds of those with whom they had contact. Thus Tacitus describes them as "cherishing hatred against all others" -  adversus omnes alios hostile odium; Hist. v. 5. So Juvenal (Sat. xiv. 103, 104), describes them.<p>Non monstrare vias eadem nisi sacra colenti,<p>Quaesitum a.d. fontem solos deducere verpos.<p>"They would not even point out the way to any one except of the same religion, nor, being asked, guide any to a fountain except the circumcised." So they are called by Appollonius "atheists and misanthropes, and the most uncultivated barbarians" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  atheoi kai misanthro&#772;poi kai apheustatoi to&#772;n barbaro&#772;n; Josephus, Contra Apion ii. 14. So Diodorus Siculus (34:p. 524), describes them as "those alone among all the nations who were unwilling to have any contact (or intermingling - &#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)  epimixias with any other nation, and who regarded all others as enemies" &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  kai polemious hupolambanein pantas.

Josephus [Against Apion, 2.14], represents one calling them "Atheists and Misanthropes, the dullest of barbarians"; and Tacitus [Histories, 5.5], "They have a hostile hatred of all other men." However, the contrariety to all men here meant is, in that they "forbid us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved" (1Th 2:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who both killed the Lord Jesus; </span> no wonder then though they have persecuted you, and the believing Jews their countrymen.

The spirit of persecution was natural to them, it descended from one generation to another; their kings were guilty of it, their priests, their false prophets, and the common people. And though better things might be expected of the Jews than any other people, yet thus they did. And it was not only because of the new doctrine or worship that the apostle preached, for they killed their own prophets before them; but it was their love to their lusts, hatred of reproof, enmity to holiness, &c., that was the cause.

For though Pilate condemned him to death, and the Roman soldiers executed the sentence, yet it was through the malice and envy of the Jews that he was delivered to him, who brought charges against him, and insisted upon the crucifixion of him; and who are therefore said to have taken him with wicked hands, and crucified and slain him; and to have killed the Prince of life, and to have been the betrayers and murderers of him; and therefore it is no wonder that such persons should persecute the followers of Christ, whether in Judea or elsewhere: <p>and their own prophets; whom God sent unto them; these they not only mocked and misused, and persecuted, but many of them they put to death, as Isaiah and others; and though this was done by their fathers, yet the present generation were the children of them that killed the prophets; and showed themselves to be of the same principles, and by their practices approved of what they had done: hence our Lord addresses the city of Jerusalem thus, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets", <a href="/matthew/23-31.htm">Matthew 23:31</a>. The Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions leave out the phrase "their own", and so does the Alexandrian copy; but it stands in the Syriac and Arabic versions, and is rightly retained, it having an emphasis in it; these prophets being of their own nation, born among them, and raised up in the midst of them, and sent unto them particularly, and yet were so used; and therefore it need not seem strange that they should treat in an ill manner persons of a lower character, that did not agree with them; the consideration of which serves to support under reproach and persecution; see <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>. <p>And have persecuted us; the apostles of Christ; have drove us out of our own country, and pursued us from place to place, and caused us to flee from one city to another: <p>and they please not God: though they reckoned themselves his chosen people, the favourites of heaven, and whom God delighted in; but neither their persons nor their actions were pleasing to him, their carnal minds being enmity to him, to his law and to his Gospel; and they in the flesh, or in an unregenerate estate, and without faith in Christ, without which it is impossible to please God, and their actions such as before described: <p>and are contrary to all men; not only Christians, but Heathens; to all the Gentiles, who are called all men, the nations of the world, the world, and the whole world; they were contrary to these, both in their religious and civil principles, and had an aversion to them, of which the following is a full instance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; <span class="cverse3">{14}</span> and they please not God, and are contrary to <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> all men:</span><p>(13) He prevents an offence which might be taken, because the Jews especially above all others persecuted the Gospel.

In the catalogue of the sins of the Jews which Paul here adduces, he begins directly with that deed which formed the climax of their wickedness—the murder of the Son of God, of Jesus the Messiah. In order to cut off all excuses for this atrocious deed of the Jews, as that they had done it in ignorance, not recognising Jesus as the Son of God, Paul adds, going backwards in time, that they had already done the same to the Old Testament prophets, whom, in like manner, they had murdered against their better knowledge and conscience.

Rather the <span class="ital">result</span> is inferred from the two preceding statements, namely, the consequences of the obstinacy of the Jews, with which they persecute the <span class="ital">messengers of God</span>, is that they please not God, that is, are hateful to Him (<span class="greekheb">Θεοστυγεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">Meiosis</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων</span>] <span class="ital">and are hostile to all men</span>. Grotius, Turretin, Michaelis, Koppe, Olshausen, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Koch, Bloomfield, Jowett, and others, erroneously find here expressed the narrow exclusiveness, by means of which the Jews strictly separated themselves from all other nations, and about which Tacit. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> v. 5 (“adversus omnes alios hostile odium”); Juvenal, <span class="ital">Sat.</span> xiv. 103 ff.; Diod. Sic. xxxiv. p. 524; Philostr. <span class="ital">Apollon.</span> v. 33; Joseph, <span class="ital">c. Apion.</span> ii. 10, 14, wrote. For (1) that <span class="ital">hostile odium</span> and desire of separation among the Jews was nothing else than a shrinking from staining themselves and their monotheistic worship by contact with idolaters. But Paul would certainly not have blamed such a shrinking, which was only a fruit of their strict observance of their ancestral religion. (2) If <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a> begins with an independent assertion, <span class="greekheb">κωλυόντων</span> … <span class="greekheb">σωθῶσιν</span> would denote nothing essentially new, but would only repeat what was already expressed in <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς ἐκδιωξάντων</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a>. (3) It is grammatically inadmissible to understand the words <span class="greekheb">καὶ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων</span> as an <span class="ital">independent</span> assertion, and thus to be considered as a <span class="ital">general truth</span>. For the participle <span class="greekheb">κωλυόντων</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>) must contain a causal statement, as it is neither united with <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, nor by an article (<span class="greekheb">καὶ κωλυόντων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">τῶν κωλυόντων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., or <span class="greekheb">τῶν καὶ κωλυόντων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), and thus is closely and directly connected with the preceding, and giving a reason for it, <span class="ital">i.e. explaining wherefore</span> or <span class="ital">in what relation</span> the Jews are to be considered as <span class="greekheb">πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίοι</span>. Thus the thought necessarily is: And who actually proved themselves to be hostilely disposed to all men <span class="ital">since</span> they hindered us from publishing the gospel to the Gentiles, and thus leading them to salvation. That is to say, the gospel offers salvation to every one, without distinction, who will surrender himself to it. But the Jews, in opposing themselves with all their might to the publication of this free and universal gospel, prove themselves, in point of fact, as enemies to <span class="ital">the whole human race</span>, in so far as they will not suffer the gospel, which alone can save men, to reach them. So Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Calovius, Bern. a Piconio, Schott, Alford, Hofmann, and others correctly interpret the words; also Wieseler on <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>, p. 49, <span class="ital">note</span>, and Auberlen, only that he would incorrectly unite <span class="greekheb">καὶ Θεῷ μὴ ἀρεσκόντων</span> with <span class="greekheb">κωλυόντων</span>, which would only be tenable if, instead of the simple connected clause <span class="greekheb">καὶ Θεῷ μὴ ἀρεσκόντων</span>, the more definitely separating form <span class="greekheb">τῶν Θεῷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. had been put.[38]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΩΛΥΌΝΤΩΝ ἩΜᾶς</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">hindering us</span>, namely, by contradictions, calumnies, laying snares for our life, etc. Comp. <a href="/acts/9-23.htm" title="And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:">Acts 9:23</a> ff; <a href="/acts/13-45.htm" title="But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.">Acts 13:45</a>; <a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>; <a href="/acts/17-13.htm" title="But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.">Acts 17:13</a>; <a href="/acts/22-22.htm" title="And they gave him audience to this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.">Acts 22:22</a>.

But it expresses not the ultimate design which the <span class="ital">Jews themselves</span>, in their so acting, had either <span class="ital">consciously</span> (Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">φησὶ γάρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι πάντα ἃ ἐποίησαν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">σκοπῷ τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν ἐποίουν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστιν ἤδεισαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἁμαρτάνουσι καὶ ἡμάρτανον</span>) or <span class="ital">unconsciously</span> (de Wette: they do it, though unconsciously, to the end, etc.; Auberlen), so that an ironical expression would have to be assumed (Schott).

When, however, the apostle says that this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΠΛΗΡΟῦΝ ΤᾺς ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑς</span></span></span> is practised by the Jews <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΝΤΟΤΕ</span></span></span>, at all times, his meaning cannot be that the Jews had at any given moment, thus already repeatedly, filled up the measure of their sins (Musculus), but he intends to say that at every division of time the conduct of the Jews was of such a nature that the general tendency of this continued sinful conduct was the filling up of the measure of their sins. Paul thus conceives that the Jews, at every renewed obstinate rejection of the truth, approached a step nearer to the complete measure of their sinfulness, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΦΘΑΣΕ ΔῈ ἘΠʼ ΑὐΤΟῪς Ἡ ὈΡΓῊ ΕἸς ΤΈΛΟς</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">but the wrath has come upon them even to the end</span>. The Vulgate, Luther, Beza, Wolf, erroneously take <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> in the sense of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΆΡ</span></span></span>.

Schott thinks that this idea must also be here preserved, whilst he finds indicated therein the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓΉ</span></span></span> breaking forth upon the Jews citius quam exspectaverint vel omnino praeter opinionem eorum. Incorrectly; for when <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΘΆΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span> is united not with the accusative of the person (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>), but with prepositions (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΘΆΝΕΙΝ ΕἼς ΤΙ</span></span></span>, <a href="/romans/9-31.htm" title="But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.">Romans 9:31</a> [see Fritzsche <span class="ital">in loco</span>]; <a href="/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Php 3:16</a>; <span class="greekheb">φθάνειν ἄχρι τινός</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.">2 Corinthians 9:14</a>; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΘΆΝ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΠΊ ΤΙΝΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-25.htm" title="That they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.">Daniel 4:25</a>), then, in the later Greek, the meaning of the verb “to anticipate” is softened into the general meaning of reaching the intended end. The aorist <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΦΘΑΣΕ</span></span></span> is not here to be taken in the sense of the present (Grotius, Pelt), also not prophetically instead of the future (Koppe: mox eveniet iis; Flatt: it will <span class="ital">certainly</span> befall them, and also it will soon befall them; and so also Schott, Bloomfield, Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Zeitschr. f. wissensch.

The article <span class="greekheb">ἡ</span> denotes either the wrath predicted by the prophets (Theophylact, Schott), or generally the wrath which is merited (Oecumenius).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΤΈΛΟς</span></span></span>] belongs to the whole sentence <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΦΘΑΣΕ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὈΡΓΉ</span></span></span>, and denotes <span class="ital">even to its</span> (the wrath’s) <span class="ital">end, i.e.</span> the wrath of God has reached its extreme limits, so that it must <span class="ital">now</span> discharge itself,—<span class="ital">now</span>, in the place of hitherto <span class="ital">long-suffering</span> and <span class="ital">patience, punishment</span> must step in. The actual <span class="ital">outbreak</span> of the wrath, the punishment itself, has thus <span class="ital">not yet</span> occurred at the composition of this Epistle. To interpret the words of the destruction of Jerusalem <span class="ital">as already happened</span>, would be contrary to the context. On the other hand, it is to be assumed that Paul, from the by no means dark signs of the times, had by presentiment foreseen the <span class="ital">impending</span> catastrophe of the Jewish people, and by means of this foresight had expressed the concluding words of this verse. It is accordingly an unnecessary arbitrariness when Ritschl (<span class="ital">Hall. A. Lit. Z.</span> 1847, No. 126) explains the words <span class="greekheb">ἔφθ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">τέλος</span> as a gloss. Incorrectly, Camerarius, Er. Schmid, Homberg, Koch, and Hofmann understand <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΤΈΛΟς</span></span></span> in the sense of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΛΈΩς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">penitus</span>. Also incorrectly, Heinsius, Michaelis, Bolten, Wahl: <span class="ital">postremo, tandem</span>. Others erroneously unite <span class="greekheb">εἰς τέλος</span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ὈΡΓΉ</span></span></span>, whilst they supply <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὖΣΑ</span></span></span>, and then either explain it: the wrath which will endure eternally or to the end of the world (Chrysostom, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Theodoret, Fab. Stapulens., Hunnius, Seb. Schmid, and others); or: the wrath which will continue to work until its full manifestation (Olshausen); or lastly: the wrath which shall end with their (the Jews’) destruction (Flatt). In all these suppositions the article <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ</span></span></span> must be repeated before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΤΈΛΟς</span></span></span>. Erroneously, moreover, de Wette refers <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΤΈΛΟς</span></span></span> to the Jews, although he unites it with the verb: “so as to make an end of them.” So also Bloomfield and Ewald: “even to complete eradication.” The apostle rather preserves the figure used in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΠΛΗΡῶΣΑΙ</span></span></span>; namely, as there is a definite measure for the <span class="ital">sins</span> of the Jews, at the filling up of which the divine wrath must discharge itself; so also there exists a definite measure for the long-suffering <span class="ital">patience</span> of God, whose fulness provokes divine punishment.

First of all, the comparison of the Thessalonian church with the Palestinian churches is “far-fetched,” although nothing is <span class="ital">more simple, more natural, and more unforced</span> than these very parallels, since the <span class="ital">tertium comparationis</span> consists simply in this, that <span class="ital">both</span> were persecuted by <span class="ital">their own countrymen</span>, and both <span class="ital">endured</span> their persecutions with <span class="ital">similar heroic courage</span>. The parallels are further “inappropriate” to Paul, as he does not elsewhere hold up the Jewish-Christians as a pattern to the Gentile-Christians. As if the repeated collections which the apostle undertook for the poor churches of Palestine had not demonstrated by fact that his love extended itself equally to the <span class="ital">Jewish</span> as to the <span class="ital">Gentile</span> churches! As if the words of the apostle, in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened:...">2 Corinthians 8:13-15</a>, did not express a high esteem for the Palestinian Jewish-Christians! As if, in <a href="/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>, the Gentile churches are not called <span class="ital">debtors</span> to the Jewish-Christians, because the spiritual blessings of Christianity reached the Gentiles only from the mother church of Jerusalem! As if Paul himself, after the fiercest persecutions, and after openly manifested obstinacy, did not always cleave to his people with such unselfish and solicitous love, that he could wish in his own person to be banished and driven from Christ, who was his all in all, in order by such an exchange to make his hardened and always resisting fellow-countrymen partakers of salvation in Christ! But if such were his feelings toward the <span class="ital">unconverted</span> among his people, why should he not have been proud of those among them who <span class="ital">believed?</span> Why should he not have recognised the heroic faith of the Palestinian brethren, and recognised and praised the stedfastness of a Gentile church as an <span class="ital">imitation</span> and <span class="ital">emulation</span> of the pattern given by these?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Further, the mention of the persecutions of the Palestinian Christians was inappropriate, because Paul could not speak of them “without thinking of himself as the person principally concerned in the only persecution which can have come properly into consideration.” But how little importance there is in such an inference is evident from this, that Paul elsewhere does not shun openly to confess his share in the persecutions of the Christians, although with a sorrowful heart (comp. <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a> “The Lord, even Jesus” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36</a>). <span class="greekheb">προφ</span>. may go either with <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτ</span>. or with <span class="greekheb">ἐκδιωξάντων</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets</span>] Revised reading, simply <span class="bld">the prophets</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christ represented His death as the culmination of the murders of the ancient prophets (<a href="/context/luke/11-47.htm" title="Woe to you! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them....">Luke 11:47-52</a>; <a href="/context/luke/13-31.htm" title="The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill you....">Luke 13:31-33</a>; <a href="/context/luke/20-9.htm" title="Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to farmers, and went into a far country for a long time....">Luke 20:9-16</a>); St Stephen had said the same thing in Paul’s hearing, with poignant force (<a href="/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>).

This is an instance of what the grammarians call <span class="ital">meiosis</span> or <span class="ital">litotes</span>, the studiously restrained and smooth expression covering intense feeling; as where the Apostle says, “I praise yon not,” meaning severe blame (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.">1 Corinthians 11:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not?

By contrast, the Apostle spoke of himself as “not pleasing men, but God” (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and are contrary to all men</span>] At war both with God and men! The sense of God’s displeasure often shews itself in sourness and ill-temper towards one’s fellows. Unbelief and cynicism go together. The rancour of the Jews against other nations at this time was notorious. Tacitus, the Roman historian, writing in the next generation, remarks on their “<span class="ital">adversus omnes alios hostile odium</span>” (<span class="ital">Histor</span>. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>). This animosity culminated in the war against Rome (a.d. 66–70), and brought a fearful retribution.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The quarrel between Judaism and the world, alas, still continues, as the <span class="ital">Judenhasse</span> of Germany and Russia testifies. Jewish hatred has been more than repaid by Christian persecution. The antipathy is powerfully impersonated in Shakespeare’s <span class="ital">Shylock</span>. The Jew says of his debtor, “I hate him, for he is a Christian.” And Antonio in turn:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“You may as well use question with the wolf,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>You may as well do anything most hard,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As seek to soften that (than which what’s harder?)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His Jewish heart.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But we may hope that better feelings will prevail in the future on both sides. St Paul is thinking, however, not of the Jewish sentiment in general, but of the opposition of his people to the rest of the world on that one point which concerned him so deeply, viz. <span class="ital">the salvation of men through Christ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1 Thessalonians 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκτεινάντων</span>, <span class="ital">who have killed</span>) This is indeed the sin of the whole people, their greatest sin, and one not yet acknowledged.—<span class="greekheb">προφήτας</span>, <span class="ital">the prophets</span>) This word is construed with <span class="ital">who have killed</span>.

This crime was often laid to the charge of the Jews: thus, by our Lord, "Ye are witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets" (<a href="/matthew/23-31.htm">Matthew 23:31</a>); and by the protomartyr Stephen, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?" (<a href="/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And have persecuted us</span>; literally, <span class="accented">driven us out</span>, as Paul and Silos were expelled from Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">And they please not God, but are contrary to all men.</span> The hatred and contempt which the Jews bore to other nations is noticed by Tacitus, Juvenal, and other heathen writers. Thus Tacitus writes of them: "They are faithful to obstinacy, and merciful toward themselves, but toward all others are actuated by the most irreconcilable hatred (<span class="accented">odium humani generis</span>)." And Juvenal says, "They will not show the road to one who was not of their religion, nor lead the thirsty person if uncircumcised to the common spring." Perhaps, however, the apostle refers here, not to the enmity of the Jews to the human race in general, though perfectly cognizant of their bigotry and intolerance; as this enmity was a perversion of their peculiar distinction as he people of God; but rather to their opposition to his preaching the gospel to the Gentiles - to their extreme reluctance that the Gentiles along with themselves should be admitted into the kingdom of God. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Persecuted (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev. more literally and correctly, drave out.
