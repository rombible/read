Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel - Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-12</a>. Since there had been committed to us an office so high and holy, and so much demanding sincerity, fidelity, and honesty, we endeavored to act in all respects in conformity to the trust reposed in us. The gospel is a system of truth and sincerity, and we evinced the same. The gospel is concerned with great realities, and we did not resort to trick and illusion. The office of the ministry is most responsible, and we acted in view of the great account which we must render. The meaning is, that Paul had such a sense of the truth, reality, and importance of the gospel, and of his responsibility, as effectually to keep him from anything like craft or cunning in preaching it. An effectual restrainer from mere management and trick will always be found in a deep conviction of the truth and importance of religion. Artifice and cunning are the usual accompaniments of a bad cause - and, when adopted by a minister of the gospel, will usually, when detected, leave the impression that he feels that he is engaged in such a cause. If an object cannot be secured by sincerity and straight-forward dealing, it is not desirable that it should be secured at all.<p>Even so we speak - In accordance with the nature of the gospel; with the truth and sincerity which such a cause demands.<p>Not as pleasing men - Not in the manner of impostors, who make it their object to please people. The meaning of the apostle is, that he did not aim to teach such doctrines as would flatter people; as would win their applause; or as would gratify their passions or their fancy. We are not to suppose that he desired to offend people; or that he regarded their esteem as of no value; or that he was indifferent whether they were pleased or displeased; but that it was not the direct object of his preaching to please them. It was to declare the truth, and to obtain the approbation of God whatever people might think of it; see the notes on <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>.<p>Which trieth our hearts - It is often said to be an attribute of God that he tries or searches the hearts of people; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-17.htm">1 Chronicles 29:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>. The meaning here is, that the apostle had a deep conviction of the truth that God knew all his motives, and that all would be revealed in the last day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. as&#8212;according as; even as.<p>allowed&#8212;Greek, "We have been approved on trial," "deemed fit." This word corresponds to "God which trieth our hearts" below. This approval as to sincerity depends solely on the grace and mercy of God (Ac 9:15; 1Co 7:25; 2Co 3:5; 1Ti 1:11, 12).<p>not as pleasing&#8212;not as persons who seek to please men; characteristic of false teachers (Ga 1:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel:</span> this verse gives the reasons of what the apostle spake in the former about his sincerity. The one is taken from his trust; God intrusted him with the gospel, to preserve it from corruption by error, therefore his <span class="ital">exhortation</span> or doctrine <span class="ital">was not of error</span> or <span class="ital">deceit, </span> but he preached the gospel in simplicity and purity; he did not, he durst not, adulterate or corrupt it, for it was committed to his trust; as he calls the gospel his trust, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1 Timothy 1:11</a></span>. And the sense of this great trust kept him also from <span class="ital">uncleanness</span> and <span class="ital">guile</span> in the discharge of his ministry. And he had this trust by God’s appointment or approbation, God approved of him for this trust, and that upon knowledge and judgment, as the word signifies, dedokimasmeya, and as he speaks, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1 Timothy 1:12</a></span>, <span class="ital">he judged me faithful, putting me into the ministry.</span> Not so before his conversion, being a <span class="ital">persecutor, blasphemer, </span>& c.; but God fitted him by extraordinary revelations, gifts, graces, and made him faithful, and then put him into the ministry, and intrusted him with the gospel. And because he speaks in the plural number, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">we were allowed of God, </span>& c., therefore Silvanus and Timotheus, yea, and other apostles and ministers, are to be understood as comprehended with him in this trust. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Even so we speak; </span> that is, as men thus approved of by God, and intrusted with the gospel, that we may faithfully discharge our trust, and be able to give a good account of it, as stewards of their trust, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>,2</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts:</span> this is another reason of their faithfulness and integrity, mentioned in the foregoing verse, which was the sense of God’s omniscience, knowing and trying their hearts. Trying imports more than mere knowing, it is a knowledge upon search and proof, as gold and silver are known by the touchstone. And though God trieth the hearts of all men, yet especially such as are intrusted with the gospel. Or these last words may have a more immediate reference to the foregoing; we speak not as pleasing men, because we know God trieth our hearts. And this confirms what he said before concerning his exhortation, that it was not of deceit, uncleanness, or guile. If it had, he would have so preached as to please men; the opinions, the lusts, the practices of men. In some cases the apostle did seek to please men, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a></span>, <span class="ital">even as I please all men in all things.</span> But he pleased not men when it stood in competition with his pleasing God; <span class="ital">we speak, not as pleasing men, but God.</span> Otherwise the rule takes place with all, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/15-2.htm" title="Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.">Romans 15:2</a></span>: <span class="ital">Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.</span> Ministers of the gospel are Christ’s servants by office, and, as servants, they are to please their own Master. <span class="ital">If I pleased men, </span> saith Paul, <span class="ital">I should not be the servant of Christ, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a></span>. And this made the apostle have regard not only to his doctrine and outward conversation, but the inward aim and intentions of his heart, as knowing God tried his heart. And expecting the reward of his labours more from God than men, he therefore sought to please God rather than men, and approve his heart unto him. And herein he reflects upon those false apostles that sought to please men, preached up the law of Moses to please the Jews; or others, that preached and abused the doctrine of the gospel to gratify the lusts of men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But as we were allowed of God,.... Or, "approved of God"; not that there were any previous fitness and worthiness in them to be ministers of the word; but such was the good will and pleasure of God, that he from all eternity chose and appointed them to this work; and in his own time by his grace called them to it, and by his gifts qualified them for it, who otherwise were unworthy of it, and insufficient for it: <p>to be put in trust with the Gospel; which is of great worth and value, a rich treasure, and of the last importance; which to be trusted with is a very great honour; and the discharge of such a trust requires great faithfulness, and which the apostles had: <p>even so we speak; the Gospel as delivered to them, both as to matter and manner; neither taking from it nor adding to it, nor mixing it with anything of their own, nor disguising it with any artifice: <p>not as pleasing men; to gain favour and affection, esteem, applause, and honour from them; to escape reproach and persecution, and obtain worldly advantages by dropping, concealing, or blending of truths to make them more agreeable to the taste of natural men: <p>but God, which trieth our hearts; studying to approve themselves to God, whose Gospel was committed to them, from whom they received gifts to preach it, and to whom they were accountable for all; and who being the searcher of the hearts, and the trier of the reins of the children of men, knows the intentions and designs of men, and the springs of all actions; and sees through all artifices, and from whom nothing can be hidden, and who will, in his own time, bring to light the hidden things of darkness; under a sense of which faithful ministers act, as of sincerity, and as in the sight of an omniscient God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> But as we were <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> trieth our hearts.</span><p>(4) To approve his conscience to God, being free from all flattery and covetousness.<p>(c) There is this difference between the judgments of God and the judgments of men, that when men choose, they give regard to the qualities of those things which stand before them, but God finds the reason of his counsel only in himself. Therefore, it follows that seeing as we are not able to think a good thought, that whoever he first chooses to those callings, he does not find them able but indeed makes them able.

If the apostle spoke only of himself, he would not have put <span class="greekheb">τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>) and <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἑαυτῶν ψυχάς</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>), but would have written both times the singular, <span class="greekheb">τὴν καρδίαν ἡμῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">τὴν ψυχὴν ἡμῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[33] So Wieseler on <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>, who, however, explains it not “to seek to please,” but “to live to please;” and after him, Hofmann and Möhler in the 3d ed. of de Wette’s Commentary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. “As God, who tests our hearts, has attested our fitness to be entrusted with the gospel,” a characteristic play on the word. The definite commission of the gospel excluded any weak attempt to flatter men’s prejudices or to adapt oneself to their tastes. Hence the thought of the following verse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak</span>] Again the A.V. misses the force of the Greek perfect: better, <span class="bld">as we have been approved by God to be entrusted</span>. “Allow” in older English bears the stronger sense of <span class="ital">accept, approve</span> (comp. <a href="/romans/14-22.htm" title="Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that comdemns not himself in that thing which he allows.">Romans 14:22</a>), but even so falls short of the meaning of St Paul. His word is the same that is rendered in the last clause of the verse as <span class="ital">trieth</span> (R. V., <span class="ital">proveth</span>); it includes both <span class="ital">proving and approving</span>, it is <span class="ital">approving on trial</span>, or <span class="ital">testing</span>: comp. ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" title="Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a> (same Greek verb, “<span class="ital">Prove</span> all things); and <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, “The fire will <span class="ital">prove</span> each man’s work.” The Apostle had been tested for his work, and tested by it; God had made proof of him as a minister of Christ, and he was shown to be worthy of his trust: <span class="ital">tried</span>, then <span class="ital">trusted</span> (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1 Timothy 1:12</a>). “To be put in trust with the gospel” is the highest conceivable responsibility; the sense of it is enough to exclude every base motive and deceitful practice (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>). On Paul’s <span class="ital">trust</span>, read <a href="/context/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;...">1 Timothy 1:12-17</a> and <a href="/context/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:...">Acts 9:15-16</a> : “He is a chosen vessel unto Me.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so we speak</span>] under the sense of this solemn trust, with the sincerity and self-abnegation that our charge demands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts</span>] R. V., <span class="bld">proveth</span> (see previous note): more precisely, <span class="bld">pleasing God—Him who proves our hearts</span>. This last is an O.T. expression, a standing attribute of God: see <a href="/psalms/17-3.htm" title="You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.">Psalm 17:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm" title="But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.">Jeremiah 11:20</a>, &c.; also <a href="/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,">Acts 1:24</a>, “Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all.” “Unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid” (Book of Common Prayer).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “heart,” in the language of the Bible, is not the seat of the feelings alone; it is “the inner man,” the real self, the centre and meeting-point of all our thoughts, feelings, and resolves. It is there that God proves us: “The Lord looketh upon the heart.” No impure motive or crafty expedient, such as might deceive men, escapes Him. The sense of this continual and omniscient scrutiny makes any kind of dishonesty impossible to the Apostle. Read <a href="/context/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God....">1 Corinthians 4:1-5</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="Why we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him....">2 Corinthians 5:9-12</a> : “He that judgeth me is the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is <span class="ital">God’s</span> gospel that Paul and Silas have to preach; <span class="ital">God</span> had trusted them with it, and given them strength and courage to proclaim it (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>); to <span class="ital">God’s</span> approval, therefore, they must look, and to that alone. “Men,” such as the magistrates of Philippi and the populace of Thessalonica, would be pleased only if the messengers of Christ were silenced. So the authorities of Jerusalem “charged Peter and John not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus;” but they answered: “If it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye” (<a href="/context/acts/4-18.htm" title="And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus....">Acts 4:18-19</a>). This sense of the sovereignty of God gives religion its invincible power; it is the conviction that makes martyrs. It is finely expressed in the <span class="ital">Antigone</span> of Sophocles (ll. 450–460), where the heroine replies to the tyrant Creon:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Nor could I think thine edict of such might,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That one who is mortal thus should overrule<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The infallible, unwritten laws of heaven.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul tells us elsewhere, and by way of example, that he “pleased all in all things for their good, unto edification” (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>; <a href="/romans/15-2.htm" title="Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.">Romans 15:2</a>). To please men in that which displeases God, is to injure them: “If (in such circumstances) I pleased men, I should not be Christ’s slave” (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>). That is, to be the slave of public opinion,—often an ignorant, sometimes an unprincipled master.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:..."><span class="ital">1 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a></span> are then a general disclaimer of unworthy motives on the part of the missionaries. Their bold testimony at Thessalonica (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:...">1 Thessalonians 2:1-2</a></span>) was due to two things—their <span class="ital">sincerity of heart</span>, and their <span class="ital">loyalty to God</span>. Now we resume the account of the Apostle’s relations to the Thessalonians, confirming these professions:—<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δεδοκιμάσμεθα</span>, <span class="ital">we have been proved</span> [<span class="ital">approved</span>]) Refer to this word, <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζοντι</span>, <span class="ital">who proveth and trieth</span>, which presently occurs.—<span class="greekheb">ἀρέσκοντες</span>) <span class="ital">careful to please</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; in contrast. <span class="cmt_word">As</span>; according as. <span class="cmt_word">We were allowed.</span> The old English for "approved." <span class="cmt_word">Of God</span>.
