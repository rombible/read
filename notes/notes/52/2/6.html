Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nor of men sought we glory - Or praise. The love of applause was not that which influenced them; see the notes on <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>.<p>Neither of you, nor yet of others - Nowhere has this been our object The love of fame is not that which has influenced us. The particular idea in this verse seems to be that though they had uncommon advantages, as the apostles of Christ, for setting up a dominion or securing an ascendancy over others, yet they had not availed themselves of it. As an apostle of Christ; as appointed by him to found churches; as endowed with the power of working miracles, Paul had every advantage for securing authority over others, and turning it to the purposes of ambition or gain.<p>When we might have been burdensome - Margin, "or, used authority." Some understand this as meaning that they might have demanded a support in virtue of their being apostles; others, as Calvin, and as it is in the margin, that they might have used authority, and have governed them wholly in that manner, exacting unqualified obedience. The Greek properly refers to that which is "weighty" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b9;  en barei - "heavy, burdensome." Anything that weighs down or oppresses - as a burden, sorrow, or authority, would meet the sense of the Greek. It seems probable, from the context, that the apostle did not refer either to authority or to support exclusively, but may have included both. In their circumstances it might have been somewhat burden some for them to have maintained him and his fellowlaborers, though as an apostle he might have required it; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-8.htm">1 Corinthians 9:8-15</a>. Rather than be oppressive in this respect, he had chosen to forego his right, and to maintain himself by his own labor. As an apostle also he might have exerted his authority, and might have made use of his great office for the purpose of placing himself at the head of churches, and giving them laws. But he chose to do nothing that would be a burden: he treated them with the gentleness with which a nurse cherishes her children (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>), or a father his sons (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). and employed only the arts of persuasion; compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm">2 Corinthians 12:13-16</a>.<p>As the apostles of Christ - Though the writer uses the word apostles here in the plural number, it is not certain that he means to apply it to Silas and Timothy. He often uses the plural number where he refers to himself only; and though Silas and Timothy are joined with him in this Epistle <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>, yet it is evident that he writes the letter as if he were alone and that they had no part in the composition or the instructions. Timothy and Silas are associated with him for the mere purpose of salutation or kind remembrance. That this is so, is apparent from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1-13</a>. In <a href="//biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, Paul uses the plural term also. "When we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone; compare <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>. "For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith." Neither Silas nor Timothy were apostles in the strict and proper sense, and there is no evidence that they had the "authority" which Paul here says might have been exerted by an apostle of Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Literally, "Nor of men (have we been found, 1Th 2:5) seeking glory." The "of" here represents a different Greek word from "of" in the clause "of you &#8230; of others." Alford makes the former (Greek, "ex") express the abstract ground of the glory; the latter (apo) the concrete object from which it was to come. The former means "originating from"; the latter means "on the part of." Many teach heretical novelties, though not for fain, yet for "glory." Paul and his associates were free even from this motive [Grotius], (Joh 5:44).<p>we might have been burdensome&#8212;that is, by claiming maintenance (1Th 2:9; 2Co 11:9; 12:16; 2Th 3:8). As, however, "glory" precedes, as well as "covetousness," the reference cannot be restricted to the latter, though I think it is not excluded. Translate, "when we might have borne heavily upon you," by pressing you with the weight of self-glorifying authority, and with the burden of our sustenance. Thus the antithesis is appropriate in the words following, "But we were gentle (the opposite of pressing weightily) among you" (1Th 2:7). On weight being connected with authority, compare Note, see on [2443]2Co 10:10, "His letters are weighty" (1Co 4:21). Alford's translation, which excludes reference to his right of claiming maintenance ("when we might have stood on our dignity"), seems to me disproved by 1Th 2:9, which uses the same Greek word unequivocally for "chargeable." Twice he received supplies from Philippi while at Thessalonica (Php 4:16).<p>as the apostles&#8212;that is, as being apostles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Nor of men sought we glory:</span> this is the third vice he vindicates his ministry from. The word <span class="ital">glory</span> first signifies some excellency in any subject; secondly, this excellency as displaying and manifesting itself; thirdly, the opinion and esteem thereof in the minds of men, as the Greek word imports, and so taken in the text: we did not seek men’s honour, high esteem, or applause; we sought them not in the inward bent of our thoughts, or the studies of our mind, nor in the outward course of our ministry and conversation, to form them so as to gain glory from men. Though honour and esteem was their due from men, yet they did not seek it. Honour is to follow men, men not to follow it. This Christ reproved in the scribes and Pharisees, that in their prayers, alms. fasting, affected habits, and titles, they sought the praise of men, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven....">Matthew 6:1-34</a></span>. <span class="ital">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</span> <span class="bld"><a href="/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a></span>. Every man ought, with reference to actions honourable and praiseworthy, and a good name is a blessing; but to seek honour, that is the evil. And as the apostle did not seek it himself, so he forbids it to others, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/5-26.htm" title="Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.">Galatians 5:26</a></span>: <span class="ital">Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, </span>& c.; and notes some false teachers as guilty of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2 Corinthians 10:12</a></span>. It is a vice directly opposite to humility, unbecoming a man as man, and highly dishonourable to God, and contrary to the gospel. The heathens cherished it as the spur to great achievements, it is one of Tully’s rules for the institution of princes; but the Christian religion, that gives all glory to God, condemns it. And yet we may seek the vindication of our name, when thereby we may provide for the honour of the name of God, as the apostle Paul often did. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither of you, nor yet of others; </span> he adds this to show that this was their general practice among others as well as these Thessalonians; they were not guilty of flattery, covetous designs, or seeking the glory of men among any churches, or in any place; their practice in their ministry was uniform, and in all places upright and sincere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ; </span> or, we were able to be in, or for, a burden, a Hebraism.

And then he means, we might have been chargeable to you, according to the power given by Christ to his apostles to reap carnal things from them to whom they sowed spiritual things.

Theodoret, Musculus, Camerarius, Estius, Beza, Grotius, Calixtus, Calovius, Clericus, Turretin, Whitby, Baumgarten, Koppe, Flatt, Ewald, Hofmann, and others take <span class="greekheb">ἐν βάρει εἶναι</span> in the sense of being burdensome (<span class="ital">sc.</span> by a demand of maintenance from the church), and thus equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβαρεῖν</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>; and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΒΑΡΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm" title="But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>; comp. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΒΑΡῆ ἘΜΑΥΤῸΝ ἘΤΉΡΗΣΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>); but this is an arbitrary assumption from <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>—arbitrary, because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΗΤΟῦΝΤΕς ΔΌΞΑΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΒΆΡΕΙ ΕἾΝΑΙ</span></span></span> must correspond; but in the first half of <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a> Paul’s custom of not suffering himself to be supported by the church, but gaining his maintenance by working with his own hands, is not indicated by a single syllable.

Heinsius, after the example of Piscator (who, however, wavers), understands <span class="greekheb">ἐν βάρει εἶναι</span> of <span class="ital">severitas</span> apostolica: Se igitur, <span class="greekheb">ἐν βάρει εἶναι δυνάμενον</span>, quum severitatem exercere apostolicam posset, lenem fuisse, eo fere modo, quo <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ῬΆΒΔῼ ἘΛΘΕῖΝ ΚΑῚ ἘΝ ἈΓΆΠῌ ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΊ ΤΕ ΠΡΑΰΤΗΤΟς</span></span></span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>, opponit. But thus <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΒΆΡΕΙ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἬΠΙΟΙ</span></span></span> will be erroneously opposed to each other.

The term was probably in current use amongst the Jews, when Jesus adopted it for His chosen Twelve. Bit it obtained in the early Church a wider application, concurrently with its stricter reference to the Twelve (including Paul, afterwards recognized as being of the same order, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-17.htm" title="Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.">Galatians 1:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm" title="But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;">Galatians 2:7</a>, &c.).

The title belonged to men who were sent out in Christ’s name by particular Churches—either with a specific and limited mission, or with a general commission to preach the gospel—as well as to those directly appointed by Jesus Himself and charged with His full authority. But after N.T. times the designation came to be reserved, with slight exceptions, to the Twelve and Paul. See Bishop Lightfoot’s detached note on the <span class="ital">Name and Office of an Apostle</span> in his Commentary on <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, pp. 92 ff.; and Huxtable’s very valuable <span class="ital">Dissertation</span> in the Pulpit Commentary on <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, pp. xxiii.–1. St Paul certainly possessed the lower apostleship (see <a href="/context/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul....">Acts 13:1-3</a>), and there was no need for him in this letter to claim the higher, nor to distinguish himself from his missionary companions. His friend Luke puts the Apostle, in the early stage of his ministry, on a level with Barnabas (<a href="/acts/14-4.htm" title="But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.">Acts 14:4</a>; <a href="/acts/14-14.htm" title="Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,">Acts 14:14</a>). The time came when he was compelled to assume the highest Apostolic powers and to assert his equality with Peter and the Twelve (<a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>; Galatians 2; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?...">1 Corinthians 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-7.htm" title="After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles....">1 Corinthians 15:7-11</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing....">2 Corinthians 12:11-13</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you....">2 Corinthians 13:3-10</a>); but it was not yet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Burdensome” is lit. <span class="bld">in</span> (or in our idiom, <span class="bld">of</span>) <span class="bld">weight</span>—an ambiguous phrase, whose sense is interpreted by <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a> : “that we might not burden any of you.” These “apostles of Christ”—according to Paul’s maxim, “They which preach the gospel should live of the gospel” (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>)—might have claimed their maintenance from the Thessalonian Church.

Not because they were <span class="ital">apostles</span> (as though this were a privilege peculiar to the name), but “as <span class="ital">Christ’s</span> apostles”—sent on His errand, preaching His word: “so hath the Lord ordained” (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>; <a href="/luke/10-7.htm" title="And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire.
