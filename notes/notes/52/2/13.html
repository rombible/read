From this point (roughly speaking) to the end of 1 Thessalonians 3, the action of the <span class= "ital">converts</span> is the chief subject.<p>This verse differs from the original in several particulars of more or less importance. Literally translated, it would run thus: <span class= "ital">And for this cause we too thank God unceasingly, that, on receiving a word of hearing at our lips of God, ye welcomed, not a word of men, but </span>(<span class= "ital">as it is in truth</span>)<span class= "ital"> a word of God, which also, </span>etc.<p><span class= "bld">For this cause</span>—viz., because of the labours we went through to teach you, which we are thankful were not wasted. <span class= "ital">We too, </span>as well as you. The two words rendered “received” are not the same; the first meaning merely an outward reception, the second the welcome given. The words “it” and “as” (as the italics show) do not stand in the Greek. St. Paul is not expressing so much his gratitude for the manner in which the word was greeted, as for the essential character of what was greeted.<p><span class= "bld">The word of God which ye heard of us.</span>—The same phrase as in <a href="/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>, which is there rendered, “the word preached.” “The word might have been, so far as you knew, a mere <span class= "ital">word spoken by us</span>—ordinary men—but it was in reality a word of God, and so you found when you embraced it.”<p><span class= "bld">You that believe.</span>—It could have no effect without this condition. (See <a href="/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe....">1 Thessalonians 2:13-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this cause </span>— Or, on this account also; <span class="ital">thank we God without ceasing </span>— See on <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm" title="We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>; that is, we not only thank him that we have been enabled to conduct ourselves, and to discharge our duty, in the manner above described, but that, <span class="ital">when ye received the word of God which ye heard, </span>&c. — Greek, <span class="greekheb">λογον ακοης του Θεου</span>, literally, <span class="ital">the word of hearing of God; </span>the word which God hath appointed to be heard through our preaching. Accordingly, the same expression, <span class="greekheb">λογον ακοης</span>, (<a href="/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a>,) is rendered by our translators, <span class="ital">the word preached. </span>But Dr. Chandler thinks the clause should be rendered, <span class="ital">the word of report concerning God; </span>supposing it to be an allusion to <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm" title="Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?">Isaiah 53:1</a>, <span class="ital">Who hath. believed, </span><span class="greekheb">τη ακοη ημων</span>, <span class="ital">our report? Ye received it not as the word of men </span>— As a mere human invention, or a doctrine framed by the wisdom of men; <span class="ital">but as it is in truth, the word of God </span>himself — Of which there is this further proof, that it <span class="ital">worketh effectually in you that believe </span>— Producing such a change in your hearts and lives as abundantly attests its divine original. Wherever the gospel is thus received — where there is a full conviction that it is nothing less than a message from Jehovah himself, a Being of infallible truth, unspotted holiness, unerring wisdom, and overflowing goodness — it is no wonder that it should produce the effect here ascribed to it. <span class="ital">For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches in Judea </span>— Imitators of their courage and constancy in suffering for the truth, as being influenced by the same Spirit which animated and supported them, though you had not been eye-witnesses of their example: <span class="ital">for ye suffered like things of your own countrymen </span>— Ye have been calumniated, imprisoned, and spoiled of your goods; <span class="ital">even as they </span>suffered <span class="ital">from the Jews </span>— Their countrymen. The same fruit, the same afflictions, and the same experience, at all times, and in all places, are an excellent criterion of evangelical truth. <span class="ital">Who both killed the Lord Jesus </span>— Their own Messiah; <span class="ital">and — </span>Before him; <span class="ital">their own prophets </span>— Who foretold his appearance; and whom God, in many distant ages of their commonwealth, raised up unto them. The expression, <span class="ital">their own prophets, </span>is emphatical; and denotes that the Jews acknowledged the prophets whom they killed to be prophets really sent of God. So remarkable were the Jews for persecuting the prophets, that Stephen challenged the council to show so much as one whom their fathers had not persecuted, <a href="/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>. <span class="ital">And have persecuted us — </span>Apostles and preachers of the gospel; <span class="ital">and they please not God </span>— Though they pretend to be so well acquainted with him and his will, and boast so much of their interest in him; nay, they are not concerned to please him, notwithstanding their fair professions; <span class="ital">and are contrary to all men </span>— Are common enemies of all mankind; full of contempt and malignity against all other nations, and behaving toward them in the most perverse and unfriendly manner. The hatred which the Jews bore to all the heathen, without exception, was taken notice of by Tacitus and Juvenal, and even by Josephus. It was directly contrary to the law of Moses, which, in the strongest terms, recommended humanity to strangers; but arose probably from their not understanding rightly the intention of the precepts of their law, which were given to prevent them from having familiar intercourse with idolaters, lest they should be induced to imitate them in their practices. <span class="ital">Forbidding us </span>— The apostles and messengers of God; <span class="ital">to speak to the Gentiles </span>— That is, to preach the gospel to them, as we are expressly commanded of God to do; <span class="ital">that they might be saved </span>— In which respect especially they show themselves to be the enemies of mankind, opposing their present and everlasting salvation; <span class="ital">to fill up, </span>&c. — So that, instead of pleasing God, they <span class="ital">fill up </span>the measure of <span class="ital">their sins always </span>— As they have ever done: but <span class="ital">the wrath </span>— The vengeance of God; <span class="ital">is come upon them </span>— Is about to overtake them unawares, while they are seeking to destroy others. Or, God has begun to punish them, and will speedily complete their destruction. The word <span class="greekheb">εφθασε</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">is come, </span>being in the past time, properly signifies <span class="ital">hath come. </span>But, as Macknight observes, the past time is here put for the present, or rather for the future, as is plain from this, that the wrath of God had not yet fallen on the Jewish nation in the full sense here expressed. The apostle only speaks of their punishment as at hand, being taught either by Christ’s prediction, or by a peculiar revelation made to himself. The original expression, <span class="greekheb">εις τελος</span>, rendered here <span class="ital">to the uttermost, </span>was understood, by the ancient commentators, as signifying that the wrath of God was coming upon the Jews, not for a few years, but for a long duration, even for many generations: which has accordingly come to pass. To render the expression as our translators have done, <span class="ital">to the uttermost, </span>is certainly not quite proper. For, though the calamities brought on the Jews by the Romans were very great, they did not utterly destroy them. According to God’s promise, that he never would make a full end of the Jews, a remnant of them was left; and in the posterity of that remnant, now multiplied to a great number, the promises concerning the conversion and restoration of Israel will be fulfilled. It may not be improper to observe here, that in the dreadful calamities brought on the Jewish nation for killing their Messiah, and opposing his gospel, we have an example and proof of the manner in which all obstinate opposition to the gospel will end.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:13-16 We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to its holiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle; but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God. Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause also thank we God - In addition to the reasons for thankfulness already suggested, the apostle here refers to the fact that they received the truth, when it was preached, in such a way as to show that they fully believed it to be the word of God.<p>Not as the word of men - Not of human origin, but as a divine revelation. You were not led to embrace it by human reasoning, or the mere arts of persuasion, or from personal respect for others, but by your conviction that it was a revelation from God. It is only when the gospel is embraced in this way that religion will show itself sufficient to abide the fiery trials to which Christians may be exposed. He who is convinced by mere human reasoning may have his faith shaken by opposite artful reasoning; he who is won by the mere arts of popular eloquence will have no faith which will be proof against similar arts in the cause of error; he who embraces religion from mere respect for a pastor, parent, or friend, or because others do, may abandon it when the popular current shall set in a different direction, or when his friends shall embrace different views; but he who embraces religion as the truth of God, and from the love of the truth, will have a faith, like that of the Thessalonians, which will abide every trial.<p>Which effectually worketh also in you that believe - The word rendered "which" here - &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2;  hos - may be referred either to "truth" or to "God." The grammatical construction will admit of either, but it is not material which is adopted. Either of them expresses a sense undeniably true, and of great importance. The meaning is, that the truth was made efficacious in the minds of all who became true Christians. It induced them to abandon their sins, to devote themselves to God, to lead pure and holy lives, and enabled them to abide the trials and temptations of life; compare notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-21.htm">Hebrews 13:21</a>. The particular illustration here is, that when they embraced the gospel it had such an efficacy on their hearts as to prepare them to meet all the terrors of bitter persecution without shrinking. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. For this cause&#8212;Seeing ye have had such teachers (1Th 2:10-12) [Bengel], "we also (as well as 'all that believe' in Macedonia and Achaia) thank God without ceasing ('always' &#8230; 'in our prayers,' 1Th 1:2), that when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us (literally, 'God's word of hearing from us,' Ro 10:16, 17), ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, even as it is truly, the word of God." Alford omits the "as" of English Version. But the "as" is required by the clause, "even as it is truly." "Ye accepted it, not (as) the word of men (which it might have been supposed to be), but (as) the word of God, even as it really is." The Greek for the first "received," implies simply the hearing of it; the Greek of the second is "accepted," or "welcomed" it. The proper object of faith, it hence appears, is the word of God, at first oral, then for security against error, written (Joh 20:30, 31; Ro 15:4; Ga 4:30). Also, that faith is the work of divine grace, is implied by Paul's thanksgiving.<p>effectually worketh also in you that believe&#8212;"Also," besides your accepting it with your hearts, it evidences itself in your lives. It shows its energy in its practical effects on you; for instance, working in you patient endurance in trial (1Th 2:14; compare Ga 3:5; 5:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle having given the reasons on his part and his fellow ministers’, why the gospel had such effect upon them, he next proceeds to show the reason on their part, for which he giveth God thanks. And that is, from their manner of receiving it; though this, as well as the former, are but subordinate reasons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. They <span class="bld">heard</span> it; some will not do that; and therefore the apostle here calls it a word of hearing, a Hebraism, as <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a></span>: <span class="ital">Faith cometh by hearing.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. They <span class="bld">received it:</span> the word importeth a receiving with affection, as Joseph the virgin Mary to his wife, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/1-20.htm" title="But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:20</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. They <span class="bld">received it not as the word of men, </span> which we receive sometimes doubting, sometimes disputing it; or believing it only with a human faith, upon grounds of reason, as the dictates of philosophy, or on the reports of men, and without the impression of the authority of God upon our minds; or when we receive the word of God because of the eloquence or learning of the preacher, and the affection we bear to him, or admiration of his person; or, as the papists, we believe it because the church believeth it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But as it is in truth, the word of God; </span> with a divine faith, ready subjection of our souls to it, and with reverent attention, as a word that is from heaven; which the apostle positively asserts in way of parenthesis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As it is in truth, </span> or truly, they believed, so he dispersed the word to them, and so they received it. And for this cause he gave thanks to God. Having mentioned before the subordinate reasons of the efficacy of the word, he now mentions the principal, which is God himself. That any receive the word as the word of God, it is not from the preachers so much as from God. And it is a great cause of thanksgiving to God, when ministers find a people receive the word with a Divine faith, which is not done without Divine grace: then they see the fruit of their ministry, for which they ought to give thanks. Which effectually worketh also in you that believe: the powerful working of God is usually expressed by this word, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a> <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Philippians 2:13</a></span>; and the working of Satan also, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a></span>. Men possessed with the devil are called <span class="ital">energumeni.</span> And where the word is believed and received as the word of God, there it hath this energy, or worketh effectually, so as to promote love, repentance, self-denial, mortification, comfort, and peace, &c. The apostle had mentioned before their <span class="ital">work of faith, labour of love, patience of hope, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a></span>; and all from hence, their receiving the word as the word of God, and so retaining it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing,.... As for their election of God, <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a> so for their effectual calling by his grace, to his kingdom and glory, just now mentioned, as well as for their reception of the word of God as such, hereafter expressed; since their having it and receiving it, and the effectual operation of it in them, were owing to the goodness and grace of God, and therefore required a constant sense of the favour, and thankfulness, without ceasing, for it. The apostle having at large considered the manner of his and his fellow ministers' entrance among them without guile, flattery, covetousness, or any sinister view, and with all simplicity, integrity, labour, diligence, affection, and tenderness, returns to observe the reception their ministry met with, and the influence and effect it had upon them: <p>because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us; or "the word of hearing of God", as the Vulgate Latin version from the Greek text literally renders it; that is, the Gospel which was preached by the apostles, and was heard and received by these Thessalonians: and it is called the word of God, because God is the author of it; it comes from him, and is ministered by his authority, and is a part of that written word which is given by his inspiration; and because his grace in choosing, redeeming, justifying, pardoning, adopting, regenerating, and giving eternal life to men, and the declaration of his will concerning saving them by his Son Jesus Christ, are the subject matter of it; and because he owns and blesses it, for the conversion and comfort of his people: and it may be called the word of hearing of God, because coming from him, and containing his will, and preached by his order, and succeeded by his power, hearing comes by it; it is divinely breathed by him; he speaks in it by his ministers, and he is heard of in it by his people; as he was by these believers, who heard his word both externally and internally; and received it into their understandings, so as to know it spiritually and experimentally; into their minds, not merely notionally, and so as to assent to the truth of it, and give credit to it, but so as to believe in Christ revealed in it; and into their affections, in the love of it, and with joy in the Holy Ghost; they received it gladly, and with meekness and readiness, so that it became the ingrafted word, and brought forth fruit in them: the manner in which they received it follows, <p>ye received it not as the word of men: which is often fallacious and deceitful, at least dubious and uncertain, and not to be depended on; nor did they receive it as the words of wise men are received, and because it was clothed with the wisdom, eloquence, and oratory of men, for it was destitute of these; nor upon the credit and authority of men, no, not of the apostles themselves: <p>but as it is in truth the word of God: it appearing to be agreeably to the perfections of his nature, and to the Scriptures of truth, and it bearing his impress and divine authority, they received it with much assurance and certainty, as infallible truth; and which was inviolably to be adhered to, without any alteration, without adding to it or taking from it; and to be had and retained in the greatest esteem and reverence, and never to be departed from: and that they received it in this manner, appears from its operation in them, <p>which effectually worketh also in you that believe: the Vulgate Latin version reads, "who worketh"; referring it to God, as indeed it may be referred to him, as well as to his word; but the sense is much the same, for God works by and with his word, and his word only effectually works when it comes in power; or is the power of God unto salvation to them that believe; and when it does come with a divine commission and power, it effectually works to the quickening of dead sinners, the enlightening of dark minds, the unstopping of deaf ears, the softening of hard hearts, producing faith which works by love, encouraging hope, delivering from the bondage of sin, Satan, and the law, and comforting and establishing the hearts of the saints under all afflictions, trials, and persecutions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received <i>it</i> not <i>as</i> the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</span><p>(11) Having approved his ministry, he commends again (to that end and purpose that I spoke of) the cheerfulness of the Thessalonians which was due to his diligence in preaching, and their brave patience.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>.

Comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>] not: “quoniam tam felici successu apud vos evangelium praedicavimus” (Pelt, Bloomfield); for (1) from <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a> and onwards the subject spoken of is not the <span class="ital">success</span> or <span class="ital">effect</span>, but only the <span class="ital">character</span> of the apostle’s preaching; (2) the intolerable tautology would arise, as we have preached to you the gospel with such happy <span class="ital">success</span>, so we thank God for the happy <span class="ital">success</span> of our ministry; (3) lastly, if Paul wished to indicate a reference of <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a> to the <span class="ital">whole</span> preceding description, he would perhaps have written <span class="greekheb">διὰ ταῦτα</span>, though certainly <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> might be justified, as <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:...">1 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a> may be taken together as <span class="ital">one idea</span>. According to Schott, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> refers back to <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν</span>: “Quum haec opera in animis vestris ad vitam divina invitatione dignam impellendis minime frustra fuerit collocata, quam <span class="ital">vos</span> ejusmodi vitam exhibueritis, <span class="ital">ego vicissim</span> cum sociis deo gratias ago assiduas, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> ff.” But still a tautology remains, which Schott himself appears to have felt, since he takes <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡμεῖς</span> in sharp contrast to <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; besides, the ground of this explanation gives way, inasmuch as <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν</span> can only denote the <span class="ital">object</span>, but in no way the <span class="ital">result</span> of the exhortations. Also de Wette refers <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> to <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν</span>, but explains it thus: Therefore, because it was so important an <span class="ital">object</span> for us (so already Flatt, but who unites what is incapable of being united) to exhort you to a worthy walk. But there is in the preceding no mention of the importance of the <span class="ital">object</span> of the apostle’s exhortations. Accordingly there remains for <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> only two connections of thought possible, namely, either to refer to the <span class="ital">earnestness</span> and <span class="ital">zeal</span> described in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,...">1 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>, with which the exhortations of the apostle were enforced. Then the thought would be: because we have so much <span class="ital">applied</span> ourselves to exhort you to walk worthy (Flatt), so we thank God for the blessed <span class="ital">result</span> of our endeavours. Or <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> may be referred to the concluding words of <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a> : <span class="greekheb">τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ βασιλείαν καὶ δόξαν</span>, so that the meaning is: Because God calls you <span class="ital">to such a glorious goal</span>, so we thank God continually that you have <span class="ital">understood</span> this call of God which has come to you, and that you have <span class="ital">obeyed</span> it. Evidently this last reference, which is found in Zanchius, Balduin, and Olshausen, is to be preferred as the nearest and simplest. So recently also Alford and Auberlen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡμεῖς</span>] to be taken together, <span class="ital">we also</span>. For not only Paul and his companions, but every true Christian who hears[37] of the conduct of the Thessalonians, must be induced to thankfulness to God. Comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15</a>. Hardly correctly, Zanchius, whom Balduin follows, places <span class="greekheb">καί</span> in contrast to the Thessalonians: non solum vos propter hanc vocationem debetis agere gratias, sed etiam nos. Erroneously also de Wette; <span class="greekheb">καί</span> belongs to the whole clause: <span class="ital">therefore also</span>, which would require <span class="greekheb">διὰ καὶ τοῦτο</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστοῦμεν τῷ Θεῷ</span>] For although the spontaneous conduct of the readers is here spoken of, yet thanks is due to God, who has ordained this spontaneous conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι παραλαβόντες λόγον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] The object of <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστοῦμεν</span>, <span class="ital">because that when ye received</span>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παραλαμβάνειν</span>] which Baumgarten-Crusius erroneously considers as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">δέχεσθαι</span>, indicates the <span class="ital">objective</span> reception—the obtaining (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-9.htm" title="As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel to you than that you have received, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:9</a>); <span class="greekheb">δέχεσθαι</span>, on the other hand, is the <span class="ital">subjective</span> reception—the acceptance (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-17.htm" title="For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went to you.">2 Corinthians 8:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀκοή</span>] is used in a passive sense, <span class="ital">that which is heard, i.e.</span> the <span class="ital">preaching</span>, the <span class="ital">message</span> (comp. <a href="/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

Arbitrarily Pelt; it is that to which one at once shows <span class="ital">obedience</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρʼ ἡμῶν</span> is to be closely connected with <span class="greekheb">ἀκοῆς</span> (Estius, Aretius, Beza, Calixtus, Koppe, Pelt, Schott, Olshausen, Alford, Hofmann, and others), and to the whole idea <span class="greekheb">λόγον ἀκοῆς παρʼ ἡμῶν</span> is added the more definite characteristic <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>. Thus: the word of God which ye have heard of us, <span class="ital">the word of God preached by us</span>. We must not, with Musculus, Piscator, Er. Schmid, Turretin, Fritzsche (on <span class="ital">2 Cor. diss.</span> I. p. 3), de Wette, Koch, and Auberlen, unite <span class="greekheb">παρʼ ἡμῶν</span> with <span class="greekheb">παραλαβόντες</span>; for against this is not only the order of the words, as we would expect <span class="greekheb">παραλαβόντες παρʼ ἡμῶν λόγον ἀκοῆς τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, whereas in the passage there exists no reason for the separation of the natural connection; but also chiefly the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἀκοῆς</span> would be strange, as <span class="ital">along with</span> <span class="greekheb">παραλαβόντες παρʼ ἡμῶν</span> it would be superfluous. It is otherwise with our interpretation, in which an important contrast exists, Paul contrasting himself as the mere publisher to the proper author of the gospel; and in which also the construction is unobjectionable (against de Wette), as <span class="greekheb">ἀκούειν παρά τινος</span> (see <a href="/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>) is used, substantives and adjectives often retaining the construction of verbs from which they are derived. See Kühner, II. pp. 217, 245.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>] not the objective genitive, the word preached by us which treats of God, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of His purposes of salvation (Erasmus, Vatablus, Musculus, Hunnius, Balduin, Er.

Also not: “quum susceperitis” (Pelt), or “propterea quod fidem habetis” (Schott), because or in so far as, ye believe and continue believing (Olsh. Koch); for if it were a causal statement, the participle <span class="greekheb">πιστεύουσιν</span> without the addition of the article would be put. <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστεύουσιν</span> rather serves only for the more precise definition of <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, thus indicating that <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> belongs to the Thessalonians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[37] So specially Alford: We as well as <span class="greekheb">πάντες οἱ πιστεύοντες ἐν τῇ Μακεδονίᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἀχαΐᾳ</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm" title="So that you were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe....">1 Thessalonians 2:13-16</a>. <span class="ital">Further thanksgiving for their endurance of trial</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">For this cause also thank we God without ceasing</span>] Revised reading: <span class="bld">And for this cause we also</span>, &c.

The recollections of the last paragraph prompt the writer to the thanksgiving which takes shape in the words that follow:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For <span class="ital">ye received the word of God</span>, &c., R. V. renders: <span class="ital">ye received from us the word of the message</span> (Greek, <span class="ital">word of hearing</span>), even the word <span class="ital">of God</span>. Perhaps the A.V. is nearer to St Paul’s meaning: “from us” in the original immediately follows “hearing,” and appears to be dependent upon it. We therefore translate, somewhat freely, but after the order of the Greek: <span class="bld">when you received the word you heard from us—God’s word</span>. “Word” is not repeated by the Apostle, nor has it the definite article; English idiom requires both. His joy is that a message heard from his lips, not his own indeed but God’s word (see <span class="ital"><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us....">1 Thessalonians 2:8-9</a></span>, and note on the last), had been thus received. For the connection of “hearing” and “from us” comp. <a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm" title="And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.">2 Timothy 2:2</a>, “what thou hast <span class="ital">heard from me</span>”; and <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>, “the Son of God proclaimed through me and Silas and Timothy.” “Faith comes by hearing”; and hearing requires “a preacher” (<a href="/context/romans/10-13.htm" title="For whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved....">Romans 10:13-17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye received</span> it <span class="ital">not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God</span>] R. V., <span class="bld">accepted</span> for <span class="ital">received</span>: the Greek verb differs from that of the last clause, which might signify the mere outward reception of something “heard”; this term, as in ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>, denotes a willing, hearty acceptance—a <span class="ital">welcome</span> given to the “word.” It is the expression used in <a href="/galatians/4-14.htm" title="And my temptation which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.">Galatians 4:14</a> :—“as an angel of God you <span class="ital">received</span> me”; again in <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Php 4:18</a>, where Paul speaks of his <span class="ital">welcoming</span> the timely gift from Philippi; and is the common Greek term for receiving a guest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Literally the clause reads, <span class="bld">you accepted not men’s word, but, as it is truly, God’s word</span>. “<span class="ital">Men’s</span> word”—the mere word of “Paul and Silas and Timothy.” The Thessalonians accepted God’s word <span class="ital">as God’s</span>, with reverence and faith. They recognised in what they heard from Paul and Silas a higher Voice, the message of the living and true God, calling them to life eternal. The success of religious teaching lies in its power to make God’s voice audible through human speech. If the preacher cannot do this, he does nothing. And this accounts for the result, which St Paul next describes:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which effectually worketh also in yom that believe</span>] <span class="bld">which also worketh</span> (R. V.: read <span class="ital">worketh</span> with an emphasis), or <span class="bld">is operative, effectual</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “work of faith” which the Apostle admired in the Thessalonian Church (ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a> : see note) is the work of God’s word in them.
