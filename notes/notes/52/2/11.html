Our great gospel privilege is, that God has called us to his kingdom and glory. The great gospel duty is, that we walk worthy of God.

Even in the former term, "exhorted," the Greek includes the additional idea of comforting and advocating one's cause: "encouragingly exhorted."

And he did this as a father to his children, with much earnestness, compassion, and love, yea, and authority also. He was before represented as a mother, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a></span>; and here as a father, whose work and duty is to exhort, counsel, and comfort his children privately at home; so did he as well as publicly, for he was their spiritual father, as he begat them to Christ by the gospel, as he tells the Corinthians also, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1 Corinthians 4:15</a></span>. As before he represented his gentleness, so here his fatherly care. Or, at their first conversion he carried it with gentleness as a mother, but afterwards used his fatherly authority. And in this he appeals to their own knowledge also, calling their own consciences to bear witness to what he speaks, that it might leave the greater impression upon them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As you know,.... This is added to the end of the last verse in the Arabic version, and which begins this verse thus, "as one of you, and as a father comforting his sons, so we", &amp;c. but for what is said in the former verse, an appeal is made both to God and to the Thessalonians, so that there is no need of adding such a clause there; it properly stands here in connection with what follows, <p>how we exhorted; to flee from wrath to come, and to Christ for refuge; to look to, and believe in him, as the only Saviour of lost sinners; to perform the duties of religion, and to continue in the faith; to cleave to Christ, and walk on in him as they had received him, and to abide by the truths and ordinances of the Gospel they had embraced: <p>and comforted; under a sense of sin, with the soul comforting doctrines of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, of full pardon by his blood, and of a plenary satisfaction and atonement by his sacrifice; and under all their afflictions and persecutions for the sake of Christ, with exceeding great and precious promises of the presence, grace, and strength of Christ here, and glory hereafter: <p>and charged everyone of you; not only publicly, but privately, going from house to house; not in an austere and domineering way, but with the greatest tenderness, and yet faithfulness: even <p>as a father doth his children; not only in an authoritative, but in an affectionate way, and also with solid wisdom and judgment; for in such a relation, in a Spiritual sense, did the apostle and his fellow ministers stand in to them; see <a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a> and the substance of the charge is as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father <i>doth</i> his children,</span><p>(9) To exhort and comfort with a fatherly mind and affection.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div>are not a mere further digression into particulars, which we can scarcely assume after the general concluding words in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>, without blaming the author, notwithstanding the freedom of epistolary composition, of great logical arbitrariness and looseness, but are <span class="ital">a proof of the general concluding sentence <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a></span>, <span class="ital">ex analogia</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,...">1 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a> are not a mere further digression into particulars, which we can scarcely assume after the general concluding words in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>, without blaming the author, notwithstanding the freedom of epistolary composition, of great logical arbitrariness and looseness, but are <span class="ital">a proof of the general concluding sentence <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a></span>, <span class="ital">ex analogia</span>. As in all that has hitherto been said the twofold reference to the apostle and his two associates on the one hand, and to the readers on the other, has predominated, so is this also the case in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:...">1 Thessalonians 2:10-12</a>. The circumstance that he has anxiously and earnestly exhorted <span class="ital">his readers</span> to a similar conduct in <span class="greekheb">ὁσιότης</span>, <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἀμεμψία</span>, is asserted by the apostle as a proof that <span class="ital">he himself</span> behaved in the most perfect manner (<span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>) among the Thessalonians <span class="greekheb">ὁσίως καὶ δικαίως καὶ ἀμέμπτως</span>. For if any one be truly desirous that <span class="ital">others</span> walk virtuously, this presupposes the endeavour after virtue in himself. It is thus erroneous when de Wette and Koch, p. 172, think that the apostle in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a> speaks of his conduct generally, and in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,...">1 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a> of his <span class="ital">ministerial conduct</span> particularly. In <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,...">1 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a> Paul does not speak wholly of his ministerial conduct, for the participles <span class="greekheb">παρακαλοῦντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">παραμυθούμενοι</span>, and <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρόμενοι</span> are not to be taken independently, but receive their full sense only in union with <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., so that the chief stress in the sentence rests on <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and the accumulation of participles serves only to bring vividly forward the earnestness and urgency of the apostle’s exhortation to <span class="greekheb">περιπατεῖν</span>. Entirely erroneous, therefore, is Pelt’s idea of the connection: Redit P. ad amorem, quo eos amplectatur, iterum profitendum; for the attestation of love, in the conduct described in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,...">1 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>, is only expressed by the addition: <span class="greekheb">ὡς πατὴρ τέκνα ἑαυτοῦ</span>, and is thus only subsidiary to the main thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθάπερ</span>] <span class="ital">as then</span>, denotes the conformity of what follows to what precedes. As regards the construction: <span class="greekheb">οἴδατε ὡς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., we miss a <span class="ital">finite tense</span>.[35] Koppe considers that the participles are put instead of the <span class="ital">finite tenses</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς παρεκαλέσαμεν καὶ παρεμυθησάμεθα καὶ ἐμαρτυρησάμεθα</span>, an assertion which we can in the present day the less accept, as it is of itself self-evident that the participles of the <span class="ital">present</span> must have another meaning than that which could have been expressed by the finite forms of the <span class="ital">aorist, i.e.</span> of the purely historical tense. Others, objecting to the two accusatives, <span class="greekheb">ἕνα ἕκαστον</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span>, have united <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span> with the participle, and suggested a <span class="ital">finite tense</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἕνα ἕκαστον</span>, which, at the beginning of the period, must have been in Paul’s mind, but which he forgot to add when dictating to his amanuensis. Vatablus, Er. Schmid, Ostermann would supply to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΝΑ ἝΚΑΣΤΟΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἨΓΑΠΉΣΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span>; Whitby, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΦΙΛΉΣΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span>, or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἨΓΑΠΉΣΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span>, or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΘΆΛΨΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span>, from <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; Pelt, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΧ ἈΦΉΚΑΜΕΝ</span></span></span>(?); Schott, a verb containing the “notio curandi sive tractandi sive educandi.”[36] But (1) the two accusatives do not at all justify supplying a special verb to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΝΑ ἝΚΑΣΤΟΝ</span></span></span>, as not only among the classics is the twofold use of personal determinations not rare (see Bernhardy, <span class="ital">Syntax</span>, p. 275), but also in Paul’s Epistles there are similar repetitions of the personal object (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>). (2) To supply <span class="greekheb">ἠγαπήσαμεν</span>, or a similar idea, is in contradiction with the <span class="ital">design</span> and <span class="ital">contents</span> of <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,...">1 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>, as the chief point in these verses is to be sought in the recollection of the impressive exhortations addressed to the Thessalonians to aim at a conduct similar to that of the apostle. Not only the simplest, but the only correct method, is, with Musculus, Wolf, Turretin, Bengel, Alford, and Hofmann, to supply <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν</span>, which has just preceded <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm" title="You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>, to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΟῦΝΤΕς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> And just because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΕΝΉΘΗΜΕΝ</span></span></span> precedes, the supplying of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἮΜΕΝ</span></span></span>, which Beza, Grotius, Flatt, and others assume, and which otherwise would be the most natural word, is to be rejected. Accordingly, there is no anacoluthon in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm" title="As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,...">1 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a>, but <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΕΝΉΘΗΜΕΝ</span></span></span> to be supplied in thought is <span class="ital">designedly</span> suppressed by the apostle in order to put the greater emphasis on the verbal ideas, <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">παραμυθεῖσθαι</span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΑΡΤΎΡΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>.

But in a fitting manner Paul changes the image formerly used of a mother and her children into that of a father and his children, because in the context the point insisted on is not so much that of <span class="ital">tender</span> love, which finds its satisfaction in itself, as that of <span class="ital">educating</span> love; for the apostle, by his exhortation, would educate the Thessalonians for the heavenly kingdom.
