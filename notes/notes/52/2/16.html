St. Paul seems to mean that there may be a certain sum of wickedness which God will allow a nation, a church, a person, to complete, before cutting” them off from all spiritual help; the Jews were industriously labouring to complete the sum.<p><span class= "bld">For.</span>—The Greek word is <span class= "ital">but;</span> and the point is this:—“The Jews have been working up to the rounded perfection of their sin; but (they had not much left to do) the wrath burst suddenly upon them to its uttermost.” The word for “is come” (which should be the simple preterite “came”) is the same as that used in <a href="/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>, <a href="/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a>, of a sudden, unexpected apparition. “The wrath” is the wrath from which Jesus is delivering us (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1Thessalonians 1:10</a>), and it had already come upon the Jews, though its outward manifestation in the destruction of Jerusalem was not to come yet awhile. The particular moment at which St. Paul means that the wrath “came” must have been the moment of their final rejection of the Messiah.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:13-16 We should receive the word of God with affections suitable to its holiness, wisdom, truth, and goodness. The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and sometimes false, foolish, and fickle; but God's word is holy, wise, just, and faithful. Let us receive and regard it accordingly. The word wrought in them, to make them examples to others in faith and good works, and in patience under sufferings, and in trials for the sake of the gospel. Murder and persecution are hateful to God, and no zeal for any thing in religion can excuse it. Nothing tends more to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins, than opposing the gospel, and hindering the salvation of souls. The pure gospel of Christ is abhorred by many, and the faithful preaching of it is hindered in many ways. But those who forbid the preaching it to sinners, to men dead in sin, do not by this please God. Those have cruel hearts, and are enemies to the glory of God, and to the salvation of his people, who deny them the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles - see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>, <a href="/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>. No particular instance is mentioned in the life of Paul previous to this, when they had formally commanded him not to preach to the pagan, but no one can doubt that this was one of the leading points of difference between him and them. Paul maintained that the Jews and Gentiles were now on a level with regard to salvation; that the wall of partition was broken down; that the Jew had no advantages over the rest of mankind in this respect, and that the pagan might be saved without becoming Jews, or being circumcised; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25-29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22-31</a>; notes, <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>. The Jews did not hold it unlawful "to speak to the Gentiles," and even to offer to them eternal life <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>, but it was only on condition that they should become proselytes to their religion, and should observe the institutions of Moses. If saved, they held that it would be as Jews - either originally such, or such by becoming proselytes. Paul maintained just the opposite opinion, that pagans might be saved without becoming proselytes to the Jewish system, and that, in fact, salvation was as freely offered to them as to the children of Abraham. Though there are no express instances in which they prohibited Paul from speaking to the Gentiles recorded before the date of this Epistle, yet events occurred afterward which showed what were their feelings, and such as to make it in the highest degree probable that they had attempted to restrain him; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21-22</a>, "And he (Christ) said unto me (Paul), Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles. And they (the Jews) gave him audience unto this word, and then lift up their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live."<p>That they might be saved - That is, as freely as others, and on the same terms, not by conversion to Judaism, but by repentance and faith.<p>To fill up their sins alway - At all times - &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  pantote - in every generation. That is, to do now as they have always done, by resisting God and exposing themselves to His wrath. The idea is, that it had been a characteristic of the nation, at all times, to oppose God, and that they did it now in this manner in conformity with their fixed character; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51-53</a>, and notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/23-32.htm">Matthew 23:32</a>, on the expression, "Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers."<p>For the wrath is come upon them - This cannot mean that the wrath of God had been then actually poured out upon them in the extreme degree referred to, or that they had experienced the full expressions of the divine displeasure, for this Epistle was written before the destruction of their city and temple (see the Introduction); but that the cup of their iniquity was full; that they were in fact abandoned by God; that they were the objects even then of his displeasure, and that their destruction was so certain that it might be spoken of as an indubitable fact. The "wrath of God" may be said to have come upon a man when he abandons him, even though there may not be as yet any external expressions of his indignation. It is not punishment that constitutes the wrath of God. That is the mere outward expression of the divine indignation, and the wrath of God may in fact have come upon a man when as yet there are no external tokens of it. The overthrow of Jerusalem and the temple, were but the outward expressions of the divine displeasure at their conduct. Paul, inspired to speak of the feelings of God, describes that wrath as already existing in the divine mind; compare <a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>.<p>To the uttermost - Greek - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  eis telos - "to the end;" that is, until wrath shall be "complete" or "exhausted;" or wrath in the extremest degree. It does not mean "to the end of their race or history;" nor necessarily to the remotest periods of time, but to that which constitutes completion, so that there should be nothing lacking of that which would make indignation perfect: "&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  eis telos - gantz und gar" - thoroughly, entirely, through and through." Passow. Some have understood this as meaning "at the last," or "at length," as Macknight, Rosenmuller, Koppe, and Wetstein; others as referring to duration, meaning that it would follow them everywhere; but the more correct interpretation seems to be to refer it to that extremity of calamity and woe which was about to come upon the nation. For an account of this, see the notes on <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Their hindrance of the Gospel preaching to the Gentiles was the last measure added to their continually accumulating iniquity, which made them fully ripe for vengeance.<p>for&#8212;Greek, "but." "But," they shall proceed no further, for (2Ti 3:8) "the" divine "wrath has (so the Greek) come upon (overtaken unexpectedly; the past tense expressing the speedy certainty of the divinely destined stroke) them to the uttermost"; not merely partial wrath, but wrath to its full extent, "even to the finishing stroke" [Edmunds]. The past tense implies that the fullest visitation of wrath was already begun. Already in A.D. 48, a tumult had occurred at the Passover in Jerusalem, when about thirty thousand (according to some) were slain; a foretaste of the whole vengeance which speedily followed (Lu 19:43, 44; 21:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved:</span> their contrariety to all men is expressed particularly in this instance; they forbade the apostles to preach to the Gentiles, which were the greater number of men; though they opposed also their preaching to the Jewish nation: for the Jews could not endure to hear that the Gentiles should be received into the church, or into special favour with God; as appears by Christ’s sermon in the synagogue, <span class="bld"><a href="/luke/4-28.htm" title="And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,">Luke 4:28</a></span>, and in the apostle’s apology for himself at Jerusalem, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.">Acts 22:21</a>,22</span>. And their forbidding them implies, not an act of authority, for they had it not, but their hindering them what they could, and stirring up the people and rulers against them, as <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/17-6.htm" title="And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brothers to the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come here also;">Acts 17:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To fill up their sins alway; </span> to cause it to rise up to such a measure and degree as will at last bring destruction. Though this was not their intention, yet through the just judgment of God it was the event. They killed the prophets; but killing Christ, and persecuting the apostles, and hindering the salvation of mankind thereby, this filled up their sin. The expression alludes to what is said of the Amorites, <span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a></span>, and foretold by Daniel, <span class="bld"><a href="/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a></span>, called <span class="ital">the consummation.</span> As here is a perfecting of holiness, and filling up of grace, so also of sin.

It was their last destruction by the Romans. God’s wrath broke forth upon them several times before, but not to the utmost till now. Or, to the end, as in the Greek. In former punishments God removed his wrath and restored them again, but this continues to the end. Or, some, by the end, understand only the perfection and consummation of this wrath. And its coming may be read in the Greek, it hath prevented them; as bringing them to judgment beforehand in this world; as the destruction of the old world, Sodom, and Jerusalem, were figures and forerunners of the last judgment. And yet this doth not contradict what the apostle speaks, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/romans/11-1.htm" title="I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid.

Speaking or preaching the Gospel is the ordinary means of saving souls, or of acquainting them with the way of salvation, the necessity of it, and of the application of it to them, and with this end and view it is preached: now though the Jews disbelieved the Gospel, and despised the ministry of it, and disavowed any such use and end of it, yet such was their envy at the Gentiles, and their hatred of them, that could they have believed it to be the means of salvation, they would have forbidden the preaching of it to them, as they now did; and it is certain, that even the believing Jews, through ignorance, did at first disapprove of the ministry of the word to the Gentiles; see <a href="/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1</a> such was the aversion of that nation to all others, and which perfectly agrees with their general sentiments, which forbid the explanation of the law to the Gentiles; and therefore it need not be wondered at, that they should do all that in them lay to hinder the entrance and spread of the Gospel among them, of which take the following proof (f): <p>"whoever has not the holy name sealed and bound in his flesh (i.e. is not circumcised)    "it is forbidden to make known to him a word of the law", and much less to study in it--and whoever is not circumcised, and they give to him  , "the least thing in the law", it is as if he destroyed the world, and dealt falsely with the name of God--Hillell and Shammai did not make known to Onkelos a word of the law, until he was circumcised--and the traditions are, that even though a man is circumcised, yet if he does not do the commands of the law, lo, he is as a Gentile in all things, and "it is forbidden to teach him the words of the law":'' <p>nay, it is a rule with the Jews (g), that <p>"if a Gentile studies in the law, he is guilty of death:'' <p>and thus were they left in providence, to judicial blindness and hardness of heart, <p>to fill up their sins alway; the measure of their own and their fathers' iniquities; see <a href="/matthew/23-32.htm">Matthew 23:32</a> a phrase expressive of the abounding of their sins, and of their being under a divine appointment, and of their being limited and restrained by a divine power, and overruled by infinite wisdom, to answer some ends and purposes of God's glory; <p>for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost: which is to be understood, not of their wrath and fury being come to its highest degree and pitch against the followers of Christ, but of "the wrath of God", as the Vulgate Latin version and Beza's ancient copy express it; and designs not so much "eternal punishment", as the Ethiopic version renders the phrase, or everlasting wrath and damnation on the reprobate part of that people, as temporal ruin and destruction, which was now near at hand, and hung over their heads; and therefore is said to be come to them, and which in a little time fell upon their nation and city, and temple, even to the uttermost, to the last degree; and was, as the Arabic version renders it, "wrath consuming"; or "the consummation, and that determined poured upon the desolate", spoken of in <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a> and which, as it is come upon them, will remain "unto the end", as the phrase may also be rendered; unto the end of the world, until the fulness of the Gentiles is brought in, and then God's elect among the Jews shall obtain mercy, and be called, and so all Israel shall be saved, <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>. <p>(f) Zohar in Lev. fol. 30. 2, 3.((g) T.

Levi. vi. 11. This curt and sharp verdict on the Jews sprang from Paul’s irritation at the moment. The apostle was in no mood to be conciliatory. He was suffering at Corinth from persistent Jewish attempts to wreck the Christian propaganda, and he flashes out in these stern sentences of anger. Later on (Romans 9-11.) he took a kinder and more hopeful view, though even this did not represent his final outlook on the prospects of Judaism. Consequently, it is arbitrary to suspect <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> (15)–16 as a later interpolation, written after 70 A.D.

As much as to say: “These Jews, if they had their way, would prevent us speaking a single word to you about the Gospel; they would willingly see all the Gentiles perish!” This stamped them as enemies of the human race. They were furious to think that unclean Gentiles claimed a share in their Messiah! Their murderous hatred against Paul was due to the fact that he preached Christ to the heathen and declared God to be the God of Jews and Gentiles equally, saving both alike through faith in Christ. So when in his defence before the Jewish multitude at the Temple he came to the words, “Depart, for I will send thee far hence <span class="ital">unto the Gentiles</span>,” they broke out in uncontrollable rage, “Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live!” (<a href="/context/acts/22-21.htm" title="And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles....">Acts 22:21-23</a>). The Jews of Thessalonica seem to have been especially mean and fanatical (<a href="/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>; <a href="/acts/17-11.htm" title="These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.">Acts 17:11</a>; <a href="/acts/17-13.htm" title="But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.">Acts 17:13</a>); and the Apostle wishes his readers to see how entirely he is on their side as against his fellow-countrymen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to fill up their sins alway</span>] After the death of Christ a space for repentance was allowed them, the “forty years” alluded to in <a href="/hebrews/3-9.htm" title="When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.">Hebrews 3:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-17.htm" title="But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?">Hebrews 3:17</a>. Had they accepted Christ’s message of reconciliation through the apostles and become His witnesses to the Gentiles, the judgement would have been averted (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm" title="Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.">Acts 3:19</a>). The measure allowed to the nation’s sins was not yet full; but this last refusal made their cup overflow—slowly filling, as it had been, for many ages. “Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers,” Jesus had said to them (<a href="/matthew/23-32.htm" title="Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.">Matthew 23:32</a>); and this they had done, beyond all question. The phrase <span class="ital">fill up their sins</span>, signifying ripeness for judgement, is used in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a> of the Amorites in Abraham’s time—an ominous parallel. “Alway:” comp.

There it is “coming;” here it “is come,” or <span class="bld">has arrived</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These words are prophetical; but the announcement goes beyond prediction. The Jews as a people had decisively refused the gospel of Jesus Christ, and their fate was sealed. The nation was moving swiftly and visibly down the inclined plane to ruin. And this calamity was to be <span class="ital">final</span>. “To the uttermost,” says the Apostle; lit., <span class="bld">unto an end</span>. In former threatenings the Lord had said, “Yet will I not make a full end” (<a href="/jeremiah/4-27.htm" title="For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.">Jeremiah 4:27</a>, and often). He does make <span class="ital">a full end</span> this time—an end of the Old Covenant and of national Israel as the elect people; still it is not “<span class="ital">the</span> end,” as though God had no further dealings with ancient Israel: see on the contrary Romans 11.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the year 70 of our Lord Jerusalem fell, after the most dreadful and calamitous siege known in history; and the Jewish people ever since have wandered without a home and without an altar. <span class="ital">Tristis exitus</span>, says Bengel: <span class="ital">urgebat miseros ira Dei, et</span> <span class="greekheb">εἰς τέλος</span> (<span class="ital">tandem</span>, at length) <span class="ital">urbem cum templo delevit</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λαλῆσαι</span>, <span class="ital">to speak</span>) Less is said than he wishes to be understood by <span class="greekheb">Ταπείνωσις</span>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ἀναπληρῶσαι</span>, <span class="ital">that they may fill up</span>) Obstinacy against receiving the word above all fills up the measure of sins.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">their</span>) the sins of the Jews.—<span class="greekheb">πάντοτε</span>) as <span class="ital">always</span>, so now also.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τέλος</span>, [tending] <span class="ital">to the end</span>) A sad closing catastrophe [Engl.

The same phrase occurs at <a href="/luke/18-5.htm" title="Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.">Luke 18:5</a>. Under Herod Agrippa the Jewish state had begun again to flourish, but after his death, <a href="/acts/12-23.htm" title="And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.">Acts 12:23</a>, the Roman procurators returned. Cumanus and Felix, and their successors, more and more harassed the Jews. This epistle was written in the year of our Lord 48, and about that time a tumult arose at Jerusalem during the feast of the passover, and an immense multitude were slain: some say, more than thirty thousand. The <span class="ital">wrath</span> of God closely pursued these miserable men, and <span class="greekheb">εἰς τέλος</span>, [at the last] <span class="ital">at length</span>, destroyed their city and temple.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forbidding us</span> - by contradicting, blaspheming, slandering, laying snares  - <span class="cmt_word">to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved.</span> Not that the Jews were averse to the proselytism of the Gentiles, provided they were circumcised -rod kept the Law of Moses; on the contrary, Judaism at this period was a proselytizing religion; but their great objection to the preaching of the gospel was that the preachers did not insist on the Gentiles becoming Jews before they became Christians. And, accordingly, we learn from the Acts of the Apostles that the unbelieving Jews were the most violent and implacable enemies of the gospel. Of the numerous persecutions mentioned in the Acts, there were only two, namely, those at Philippi and Ephesus, which were not occasioned by the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">To fill up their sins always</span>; so that the measure of their iniquity became full to overflowing. Their forbidding the apostles to preach to the Gentiles was the last drop which caused the cup of their iniquity to overflow (cutup. <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, "The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full"). The remark of Professor Jowett is well worthy of notice: "In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents, and had the power of going on or of retreating. But as the crisis of their fate approaches, they are bound under a curse and the form in which their destiny presents itself to our minds is as though it were certain, and only a question of time how soon it is to be fulfilled." <span class="cmt_word">For the wrath</span>; that wrath which was predicted and is merited by them. "Wrath" is here used for punishment, which is the effect of wrath. <span class="cmt_word">Is come upon them to the uttermost</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to the end</span>. The apostle here refers to the judgments of God, which were impending on Jerusalem and the Jewish people; judgments which were fearfully executed in the awful sufferings they endured in the Jewish war, and in the destruction of their city by the Romans. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To speak - that they might be saved (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Not, to speak to the Gentiles in order that they might be saved, but to tell the Gentiles that they might be saved.
