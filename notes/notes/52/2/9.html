Though but "three Sabbaths" are mentioned, Ac 17:2, these refer merely to the time of his preaching to the Jews in the synagogue. When rejected by them as a body, after having converted a few Jews, he turned to the Gentiles; of these (whom he preached to in a place distinct from the synagogue) "a great multitude believed" (Ac 17:4, where the oldest manuscripts read, "of the devout [proselytes] and Greeks a great multitude"); then after he had, by labors continued among the Gentiles for some time, gathered in many converts, the Jews, provoked by his success, assaulted Jason's house, and drove him away. His receiving "once and again" supplies from Philippi, implies a longer stay at Thessalonica than three weeks (Php 4:16).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To make good what he had asserted before about their integrity in preaching the gospel, that it was without covetousness, and vain-glory, &c., and about their great affection to them therein, he appeals to their own memory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Our labour and travail: labour, </span> in what we suffered, attended with care and solicitude of mind, as the word imports; and <span class="ital">travail, </span> in what we did, attended with weariness, as some distinguish of the words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you; </span> this refers to some bodily labour they used, which I find not mentioned in the story while they were at Thessalonica, though Paul did practise it at Corinth, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a></span>.

The great pains they took, even to weariness. The Vulgate Latin version renders the last word, "weariness"; and the Arabic version, "anxiety"; and the Ethiopic version, "affliction"; it is to be understood both of corporeal and spiritual labour, working with their hands and preaching the Gospel; this could not but be remembered by them, since it was not a year ago they were with them: <p>for labouring night and day; at our handicraft, or "at the work of our hands", as the Syriac version renders it; which they continually attended to, even night and day, when they were not preaching the Gospel, or disputing with the Jews, or praying and conversing with those that believed, or refreshing themselves with food and rest. The apostle's business was making of tents; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>, <p>because we would not be chargeable to any of you; neither to the whole body, nor to any single person; which shows that they did not seek their own ease and worldly interest; and proves what is before asserted, that they did not use a cloak of covetousness, but chose to forego, and not insist on what they had a right to, lest the Gospel should be hindered or reproached: <p>we preached unto you the Gospel of God; freely and with great application and diligence; for this is the other part of their labour and travel; for the ministry of the word is a work, and a laborious one, when closely attended to; a preparation for it by prayer, reading, meditation, and much study, are wearisome and fatiguing; and to preach the word in season and out of season, with all longsuffering and doctrine, is very laborious; to which no man is sufficient of himself, and is a work which requires great faithfulness, application, and industry; and is oftentimes made the more heavy through the malice and opposition of enemies, and the weakness of friends. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</span><p>(7) To let go of his own rights, rather than to be a cost to his sheep.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γάρ</span> refers not to <span class="greekheb">δυναμενοι ἐν βάρει εἶναι</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a> (Flatt), but either to <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν ἤπιοι</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>), or to <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκοῦμεν μεταδοῦναι</span>, or, finally, to <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπητοὶ ἡμῖν ἐγενήθητε</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>). For the first reference (<span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν ἤπιοι</span>), it may be argued that <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν ἤπιοι</span> is the chief idea, the theme as it were, of <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:...">1 Thessalonians 2:7-8</a>; but against this is, that the same thought which was expressed in <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν ἤπιοι</span> is repeated and more definitely developed in a much more vivid and special manner by means of the parallel sentence, attached without a copula, and thus complete. In such a case a causal conjunction following refers rather to the more vivid and concrete expression than to the more general and abstract. Accordingly, we are referred to the connection with <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκοῦμεν μεταδοῦναι</span>. Neither can this, however, be the correct connection; for then must <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a> have proved the readiness of the apostle when at Thessalonica to sacrifice his own life for the Thessalonians, as is expressed in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>. But this is not the case, for in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a> Paul speaks indeed of his self-sacrificing love, but not of the danger of his life which arose from it. Also Auberlen, who recently has maintained a reference to <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκοῦμεν μεταδοῦναι</span>, can only support this meaning, that Paul has adduced his manual labour mentioned in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a> as a “risking of his health and life.” But how forced is this idea of the context, and how arbitrarily is the idea of the sacrifice of life, supposed to be expressed therein, contorted and softened down! It is best, therefore, to unite <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> with <span class="greekheb">διότι ἀγαπητοὶ ἡμῖν ἐγενήθητε</span>, a union which, besides, is recommended by the direct proximity of the words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μνημονεύετε</span>] as <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> proves, is indicative, not imperative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κόπος</span> and <span class="greekheb">μόχθος</span>] <span class="ital">labour</span> and <span class="ital">pains</span>: placed together also in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm" title="In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>.

Jewish fathers, even if wealthy, had their sons taught some mechanical craft as a remedy against poverty or idleness; and Paul had learnt in his youth at Tarsus the business of cutting out and stitching the coarse goats’ hair cloth used in Cilicia for making tents. He found this skill hi his wandering apostleship a great resource. An irksome kind of labour, to be sure, and but ill paid. It was a pathetic sight when the Apostle held up “these hands” to the Ephesian elders, hard and blackened with their rough task (<a href="/acts/20-34.htm" title="Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.">Acts 20:34</a>). But he thus earned for himself the necessaries of subsistence, and avoided burdening the infant Churches with his maintenance. In this way he was free to direct his own movements, and raised himself above mean suspicions. At the same time, he did not refuse occasional aid from a Church like the Philippian, in which he had full confidence, and whose affection would have been hurt by refusal. On this subject read <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?...">1 Corinthians 9:1-19</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?...">2 Corinthians 11:7-12</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity....">Php 4:10-20</a>; <a href="/context/acts/20-33.htm" title="I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel....">Acts 20:33-35</a>. Silas and Timothy, who are included in this statement, may have had other means of support. But in <a href="/acts/20-34.htm" title="Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.">Acts 20:34</a> the Apostle speaks of “these hands” as “ministering” also “to the needs of those with me.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for labouring night and day</span>] Omit “for,” and read this clause in apposition with the last. <span class="bld">Ye remember … our labour ant travail: working night and day … we preached</span>, &c. Busy in teaching and preaching during the daytime, the Apostle often pursued his tentmaking far into the night.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because we would not be chargeable unto any of you</span>] St Paul puts it in a more delicate way than this: <span class="bld">that we might not lay a burden on any of you</span>. It was consideration for his Thessalonian flock, rather than regard to his personal independence, that influenced him. How different was he from the false shepherds who “eat the fat and clothe them with the wool, but feed not the flock” (<a href="/ezekiel/34-3.htm" title="You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but you feed not the flock.">Ezekiel 34:3</a>). Most of the Thessalonian Christians, doubtless, were poor; while at Philippi there was “Lydia, a seller of purple,” and perhaps others of considerable means, who could afford to “send once and again to” Paul’s “necessity” (<a href="/context/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only....">Php 4:15-16</a>). Yet Jason of Thessalonica, in whose house the apostles lodged, seems to have been a man of substance (<a href="/context/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people....">Acts 17:5-9</a>); and there were “of the first women” of the city “not a few” amongst Paul’s adherents in this place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus “making the gospel without expense,” as later at Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm" title="What is my reward then? Truly that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>),—<span class="ital">we preached unto you the gospel of God</span>) “Preached” is <span class="ital">proclaimed</span>, <span class="bld">heralded</span>. St Paul refers to the circumstances of his “entrance” (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>) and the manner in which he and his companions then bore themselves. The Herald, or Town Crier, in ancient cities was commonly a salaried official.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A third time the Apostle writes “the gospel <span class="ital">of God</span>” (comp. <span class="ital"><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a></span>)—a phrase occurring only thrice in all the other Epistles. It suggests in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a> the greatness of the charge entrusted to Paul; here, <span class="ital">the greatness of the boon gratuitously bestowed</span> on the Thessalonians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; a proof or confirmation of this dearness of the Thessalonians to the apostle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye remember, brethren</span>; recalling to their recollection his conduct when he was with them. <span class="cmt_word">Our labor and travail</span>. These two terms frequently occur together (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>), and can hardly be distinguished; "labor," or" toil," is active, denoting exertion; "travail" is passive, denoting weariness or fatigue, the effect of the exertion. <span class="cmt_word">For laboring</span>; in its strict meaning chiefly used of manual labor. Paul here refers to his working for his own support as a tent-maker. <span class="cmt_word">Night and day</span>. Night precedes according to the Jewish mode of reckoning. It does not denote that the apostle made up by labor at night the loss of time during the day which his higher duties, as a preacher of the gospel, occasioned; that he wrought at his trade at night, and preached during the (lay; but the phrase, "night and day," denotes incessantly, continually. <span class="cmt_word">Because we would not be chargeable to any of you.</span> Not a proof of the poverty of the Church of Thessalonica; but the reason of this unselfish conduct of the apostle was that no hindrance should arise on his part to the spread of the gospel; that no imputation of selfishness or covetousness should be laid to his charge. As he had done at Thessalonica so the apostle acted in other places. Thus at the time he was writing this Epistle he was working for his support at Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>). And such was also his practice at Ephesus; for in his farewell address to the Ephesian elders he could appeal to them: "Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me" (<a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a><span class="cmt_word">).
