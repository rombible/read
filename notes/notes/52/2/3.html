Flattery and covetousness were vices to which the teachers of philosophy, in ancient times, were remarkably addicted. And they are vices which, more or less, enter into the character of all impostors, who, as the apostle observes, (<a href="/romans/16-18.htm" title="For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.">Romans 16:18</a>,) <span class="ital">by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For our exhortation - That is, the exhortation to embrace the gospel. The word seems to be used here so as to include preaching in general. The sense is, that the means which they used to induce them to become Christians were not such as to delude them.<p>Was not of deceit - Was not founded on sophistry. The apostle means to say, that the Thessalonians knew that his manner of preaching was not such as was adopted by the advocates of error.<p>Nor of uncleanness - Not such as to lead to an impure life. It was such as to lead to holiness and purity. The apostle appeals to what they knew to be the tendency of his doctrine as an evidence that it was true. Most of the teaching of the pagan philosophers led to a life of licentiousness and corruption. The tendency of the gospel was just the reverse.Nor in guile - Not by the arts of deceit. There was no craftiness or trick, such as could not bear a severe scrutiny. No point was carried by art, cunning, or stratagem. Everything was done on the most honorable and fair principles. It is much when a man can say that he has never endeavored to accomplish anything by mere trick, craft, or cunning. Sagacity and shrewdness are always allowable in ministers as well as others; trick and cunning never. Yet stratagem often takes the place of sagacity, and trick is often miscalled shrewdness. Guile, craft, cunning. imply deception, and can never be reconciled with that entire honesty which a minister of the gospel, and all other Christians, ought to possess; see notes on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>; compare <a href="/psalms/32-2.htm">Psalm 32:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a>; <a href="/john/1-47.htm">John 1:47</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-5.htm">Revelation 14:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Or to their sincerity in preaching; We did not use any impostures, we designed not to seduce men, as the false apostles did, but we really sought your conversion and salvation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nor of uncleanness; </span> ez akayarsiav. If this refers to the doctrine preached, it denotes the purity of it, which did not tend to gratify the flesh, as that of the Nicolaitanes and Libertines, &c. If we refer it to the manner of their preaching, it denotes the purity of their hearts; they were not acted by any impure lusts in their preaching, as covetousness, pride, or vain-glory. Nor in guile; this seems to be mentioned before, and therefore some expositors refer the two former expressions to the matter that they taught, and this only to the manner, which is most probable. They had no cunning designs upon them, to make merchandise of them, as the false apostles did; but approve their hearts to God, and make themselves manifest to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. And the apostle allegeth all this as a further reason of his boldness in preaching, for sincerity breeds boldness; or as some cause also of his great success, for uprightness is usually attended with a blessing; or as an argument to these Thessalonians to continue their affection to him, and to abide in the doctrine preached to them, for suspicion of insincerity in the preacher hinders the efficacy of the word upon the people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For our exhortation,....

The meaning of this word is modified according to the different circumstances of those to whom the address is directed. If the address is made to a sufferer or mourner, then it is naturally consolatory, and <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> denotes comfort, consolation; but if it is directed to a moral or intellectual want, then <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> is to be translated exhortation, admonition. Now the first evangelical preaching naturally consists in exhortation and admonition,—namely, in a demand to put away their sins, and to lay hold on the salvation offered by God through the mission of His Son (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm" title="Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be you reconciled to God.">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>). Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> might be used to denote the preaching of the gospel generally. So here, where to adhere to the meaning <span class="ital">consolatio</span>, with Zwingli, would be unsuitable. Yet it is erroneous to replace <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> with <span class="greekheb">διδαχή</span> (Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, de Wette) or with <span class="greekheb">διδασκαλία</span> (Theodoret); for, according to the above, more is contained in <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> than in these ideas. Pelt explains <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> erroneously by <span class="ital">docendi ratio</span>. But <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span>, understood as an <span class="ital">exhortative address</span>, or as the preaching of the gospel, may be taken either in an objective or subjective meaning: in the first case, it denotes the contents or subject of the preaching; in the second case, the preaching itself. The latter meaning is to be preferred on account of <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span> of the apostle and his assistants had its origin not <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πλάνης</span>. <span class="greekheb">πλάνη</span>, error, is used in a transitive and intransitive sense. In the former case it denotes <span class="ital">deceitfulness</span> (<a href="/matthew/27-64.htm" title="Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.">Matthew 27:64</a>) or <span class="ital">seduction</span> (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm" title="That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;">Ephesians 4:14</a>); in the latter, which is the more usual meaning, <span class="ital">delusion</span>. In both cases <span class="greekheb">πλάνη</span> is the contrast of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> (<a href="/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1 John 4:6</a>): in the former case, of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> in a subjective sense, <span class="ital">truthfulness</span>; in the latter, of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> in an objective sense, <span class="ital">truth</span> (thus in <a href="/romans/1-27.htm" title="And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.">Romans 1:27</a>, where <span class="greekheb">πλάνη</span> refers to the idolatrous perversion of Monotheistic worship). Also, here <span class="greekheb">πλάνη</span> (on account of the succeeding <span class="greekheb">ἐν δόλῳ</span>) is best rendered not <span class="ital">impostura</span> (Erasmus, Calvin, Hemming, Estius, Beza, Turretin) or <span class="ital">seducendi studium</span> (Vorstius, Grotius, Baumgarten-Crusius), but <span class="ital">delusion</span>. Accordingly the sense is: the apostle and his associates avoided not sufferings and trials in the preaching of the gospel, because their preaching rested not on a fiction, a whim, a dream, a delusion,—consequently it had not such as these for its object and contents; but it is founded on reality,—that is to say, it has divine truth as its source.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἐξ ἀκαθαρσίας</span>] a second reason different from the first, and heightening it. Paul turns from the <span class="ital">objective</span> side of the origin of his preaching to its <span class="ital">subjective</span> side,—that is, to the <span class="ital">motive</span> which lay at the foundation of the gospel preaching of himself and his assistants. This motive is not <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span> (see Tittmann, <span class="ital">de synonym. in N.

Our confidence is in <span class="ital">God</span>, not in ourselves; our work is not self-appointed but a sacred trust or commission, for which we are responsible to Him (4). Hence, discouragement and hesitation are impossible. Paul argues that the very fact of their cheerful perseverance at Thessalonica, after their bad treatment at Philippi, points to the divine source and strength of their mission; what impelled them was simply a sense of lasting responsibility to God, upon the one hand, and an overpowering devotion to men upon the other (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὑμᾶς</span> of <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>), for the gospel’s sake. Had the apostles yielded to feelings of irritation and despondency, giving up their task in Macedonia, after the troubles at Philippi, or had they conducted themselves at Thessalonica in such a way as to secure ease and profit; in either case, they would have proved their mission to be ambitious or selfish, and therefore undivine.

Their preaching did not spring from some delusion or mistake. Paul was neither fool nor knave, neither deceived nor a deceiver (<span class="greekheb">δόλῳ</span>). Nor was his mission a sordid attempt (<span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσίας</span>) to make a good thing out of preaching, the impure motive being either to secure money (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξίας</span> <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>, and <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), or to gain a position of importance (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a>) and popularity. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Tacit., <span class="ital">Annal.</span>, vi, 21 (of Tiberius’ attitude to astrologers) “si uanitatis aut fraudum suspicio incesserat”.
