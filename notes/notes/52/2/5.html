Suffering in a good cause should sharpen holy resolution. The gospel of Christ at first met with much opposition; and it was preached with contention, with striving in preaching, and against opposition. And as the matter of the apostle's exhortation was true and pure, the manner of his speaking was without guile. The gospel of Christ is designed for mortifying corrupt affections, and that men may be brought under the power of faith. This is the great motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only sees all we do, but knows our thoughts afar off, and searches the heart. And it is from this God who trieth our hearts, that we must receive our reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity were, that he avoided flattery and covetousness. He avoided ambition and vain-glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For neither at any time used we flattering words - see the <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21-22</a> notes; and on <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a> note. The word here rendered "flattering" - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  kolakeias - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The meaning is, that the apostle did not deal in the language of adulation; he did not praise them for their beauty, wealth, talent, or accomplishments, and conceal from them the painful truths about their guilt and danger. He stated simple truth - not refusing to commend people if truth would admit of it, and never hesitating to declare his honest convictions about their guilt and danger. One of the principal arts of the deceiver on all subjects is flattery; and Paul says, that when preaching to the Thessalonians he had carefully avoided it. He now appeals to that fact as a proof of his own integrity. They knew that he had been faithful to their souls.<p>Nor a cloke of covetousness - The word rendered "cloke" here - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  prophasei - means, properly, "what is shown or appears before any one;" i. e., "show, pretence, pretext," put forth in order to cover one's real intent; <a href="/matthew/22-14.htm">Matthew 22:14</a>; <a href="/mark/12-40.htm">Mark 12:40</a>; <a href="/luke/20-47.htm">Luke 20:47</a>. The meaning here is, that he did not put on a pretence or appearance of piety for the sake of promoting the schemes of covetousness. The evidence of that was not only what they observed of the general spirit of the apostle, but also the fact that when with them he had actually labored with his own hands for a support; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>. It is obvious that there were those there, as sometimes there are now, who, under the pretence of great zeal for religion, were really seeking wealth, and it is possible that it may have been alleged against Paul and his fellow-laborers that they were such persons.<p>God is witness - This is a solemn appeal to God for the truth of what he had said. He refers not only to their own observation, but he calls God himself to witness his sincerity. God knew the truth in the case. There could have been no imposing on him; and the appeal, therefore, is to one who was intimately acquainted with the truth. Learn hence:<p>(1) That it is right, on important occasions, to appeal to God for the truth of what we say.<p>(2) we should always so live that we can properly make such an appeal to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. used we flattering words&#8212;literally, "become (that is, have we been found) in (the use of) language of flattery"; the resource of those who try to "please men."<p>as ye know&#8212;"Ye know" as to whether I flattered you; as to "covetousness," God, the Judge of the heart, alone can be "my witness."<p>cloak of&#8212;that is, any specious guise under which I might cloak "covetousness."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the former verses the apostle had asserted his integrity more generally; here, and in the next verse, he instanceth in particulars. He vindicates his ministry from the guilt of three vices which too often attend it; flattery, covetousness, and vain-glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For neither at any time used we flattering words:</span> first, flattery, en logw kolakeiav; or, we were not, i.e. conversant, in a word of flattery, as in the Greek; our word was not a word of flattery, as if we sought to please men. When we ascribe to men good things that they have not, or above what they have, or when we applaud or extenuate the evil that is in them, we flatter them. This is reproved often in the false prophets of the Old Testament, <span class="bld"><a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm" title="Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits:">Isaiah 30:10</a> <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm" title="Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, see, others daubed it with untempered mortar:">Ezekiel 13:10</a>,18</span>; and in the false teachers in the New. The flattery of ministers is, their preaching of smooth things, rather to please than profit; when they avoid just reproofs, and searching truths, and close applications, that they may not displease; and affect wisdom of words, and rhetorical discourses, that they may please: when they either conceal some part of truth, or pervert it, that people may think their doings better than they are, or their state better than it is. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As ye know:</span> their words in preaching being an overt act, they themselves could judge of, and therefore the apostle doth appeal to their own knowledge in that. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness:</span> in what they could not know, which was their inward aims and designs, he appeals to God, which is a form of swearing; and in all oaths men solemnly do concern God therein; the same in effect that is called protesting, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1 Corinthians 15:31</a></span>. And that wherein he thus appeals is, that he had no covetous design in his ministry, which he calls <span class="ital">a cloak of covetousness; </span> which lies either in undue withholding what we have, or inordinate desire of more. The latter is here meant, as the Greek word imports. And the word <span class="ital">cloak</span> is a metaphor as the word is translated here, and <span class="bld"><a href="/john/15-22.htm" title="If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.">John 15:22</a></span>: as that covers the inner garments, so when bad designs are covered with specious pretexts, this we call a cloak.

To introduce them into the affections, and gain the esteem and good will of men; they did not in their ministry deliver such things as flattered men with a good opinion of themselves: they did not preach up the purity of human nature, but on the contrary the doctrine of original sin, the imputation of Adam's transgression to his posterity, and the corruption of all human nature; they asserted the universal pollution of it, of all men, and of all the powers and faculties of their souls, that they are all under the power and dominion of sin, are involved in the guilt of it, and are all guilty before God, and liable to everlasting wrath and punishment; and that unless they repented of their sins and believed in Christ, they would perish eternally; thus they dealt roundly and freely with men's consciences, and plainly, openly, and faithfully told them their case as it was: nor did they cry up the power of man's free will, which would have been grateful to Jews and Gentiles; but they declared the reverse, they asserted the weakness and impotency of man, to anything that is spiritually good; and represented him as a weak and strengthless creature, and unable to do anything, even to think a good thought of himself; and ascribed all that a man is, or has, or does, that is good, to the grace and power of God, who works in him both to will and to do: nor did they plead for the sufficiency of man's righteousness to justify him before God, a doctrine very pleasing to human nature; but, on the contrary, they gave out that there was none righteous, no, not one of the sons of Adam, in and of themselves, or by virtue of any righteousness of their own; so far from it that they were full of all unrighteousness, and were not capable of working out a righteousness, or of attaining to the righteousness of the law; that what they did pretend to was not a justifying righteousness, and would give no right and title to eternal glory; and that the righteousness of Christ was the only righteousness, by which a man could be justified from all things, and in which he could be found safe. They did not blend and mix their doctrine to suit with the tastes of different men, but with all sincerity and plainness preached the truth, as it is in Jesus; they did not connive at the sins of men, cry Peace, Peace, when there was none, or sow pillows under their armholes, or promise them life, though they should not return from their wicked way; but they with great freedom inveighed against the sins of men, and exhorted them to repentance and reformation, as well as to faith in Christ for pardon and righteousness; nor did they wink at the sins of professors, or of one another, the Apostle Paul withstood Peter to the face because he was to be blamed; and when they praised men for their gifts and graces, and the exercise of them, they took care to ascribe them to the grace of God, and give him the glory, and prevent men from boasting in themselves; in short, they acted the reverse of the false teachers, who had men's persons in admiration because of advantage, and by good words and fair speeches deceived the hearts of the simple; but so did not the apostles of Christ, no, never, not "at any time": when they first came to Thessalonica during their stay there, either in public or in private: and though this was true of any other time and place, yet here must be confined to this, since the apostle appeals to this church for the truth of what he said, <p>as ye know; for flattering words may be discerned; a flatterer is known by his words; though in general such is the weakness of human nature, that men love to be flattered, though they know they are: <p>nor a cloak of covetousness; or "an occasion of" it, they did not take the opportunity or advantage by the ministry of the word, to indulge a covetous disposition, or to amass wealth and riches to themselves; or an "excuse" for covetousness, which covetous men are never at a loss to make, always pretending one thing or another to hide and cover their evil; but the apostles made no excuses, nor used any cloak, nor needed any to cover their covetousness, because they had not the thing; they did not pretend one thing and mean another; they did not, as the false apostles did, pretend to serve Christ, preach his Gospel, seek the glory of God and the good of souls, and mean themselves, and design their own worldly advantage; they did not make these a "pretence" for covetousness, they sincerely served Christ, faithfully preached his Gospel, truly sought the glory of God, and were heartily concerned for the good of souls without any mercenary and selfish views; for the truth of which they could appeal to the heart searching and rein-trying God, as the apostle here does, saying, <p>God is witness; which is properly an oath, a solemn appeal to God; for since covetousness is an internal and secret sin, and may be so coloured and disguised as not easily to be discerned, as flattering words may, the apostle therefore calls God to witness the truth of what he had said. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>.

The word is not again found in the N. T. <span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ κολακείας</span> cannot denote in a <span class="ital">rumour</span> (report) of flattery, according to which the sense would be: for never has one <span class="ital">blamed</span> us of flattery (so Heinsius, Hammond, Clericus, Michaelis). Against this is the context, for the point here is not what <span class="ital">others said</span> of the apostle’s conduct, but what it was in <span class="ital">reality</span>. Also it is inadmissible to take <span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ κολακείας</span>, according to the analogy of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">דָּבָר</span> with the following substantive, as a circumlocution for <span class="greekheb">ἐν κολακείᾳ</span> (so Pelt, who, however, when he renders the clause: in assentationis crimen incurri, involuntarily falls into the afore-mentioned explanation). For—(1) the Hebrew use of <span class="greekheb">דָּבָר</span> is foreign to the N. T.; (2) it is overlooked that <span class="greekheb">λόγος κολακείας</span> finds in the context its full import and reference, inasmuch as the apostle, in complete conformity to the contents of the preceding verses (comp. <span class="greekheb">λαλῆσαι</span> <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>; <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; <span class="greekheb">λαλοῦμεν</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>), in the beginning of <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm" title="For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a> still speaks of a quality of his discourse, and only in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm" title="Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a> passes to describe his conduct in Thessalonica in general. Accordingly, the apostle denies that he appeared in Thessalonica with a mode of speech whose nature or contents was flattery (Schott falsely takes <span class="greekheb">κολακείας</span> as the genitive of origin), or that he showed himself infected with it. In Thessalonica, for this limitation of <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ποτέ</span> is demanded by the accessory appeal to the actual knowledge of the readers<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθὼς οἴδατε</span>, as ye know.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὔτε ἐν προφάσει πλεονεξίας</span>] sc. <span class="greekheb">ἐγενήθημεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρόφασις</span>, from <span class="greekheb">προφαίνω</span> (not from <span class="greekheb">πρόφημι</span>), denotes that which one puts on for appearance, and with the definite design to colour or to cloak something else It therefore denotes pretext, the outward show, and has its contrast (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-18.htm" title="What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.">Php 1:18</a>) in <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span>. See proofs in Raphel, Polyb. p. 354. The meaning accordingly is: we appeared not in a pretext for covetousness, i.e. our gospel preaching was not of this nature, that it was only a pretext or cloak to conceal our proper design, namely, covetousness. Without linguistic reason, and against the context, Heinsius and Hammond understand <span class="greekheb">πρόφασις</span> as accusatio; Pelt, weakening the idea, and not exhausting the fundamental import of <span class="greekheb">πρόφασις</span> (see below), nunquam ostendi avaritiam; Wolf also unsatisfactorily considers <span class="greekheb">πρόφασις</span> as equivalent to species; similarly Ewald, “even in an appearance of covetousness;” for the emphatic even (by which that interpretation is at all suitable, and by means of which there would be a reference to a supplementary clause, “to say nothing of its being really covetousness”) is interpolated, and the question at issue is not whether Paul and his associates avoided the appearance of <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span>, but whether they actually kept themselves at a distance from <span class="greekheb">πλεονεξία</span>.
