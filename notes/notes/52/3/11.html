But the word is probably added without such specific reference: “May God Himself direct us; for in that case who could hinder?”<p><span class= "bld">And our Lord . . .</span>—An important theological passage. From the use of the <span class= "ital">singular</span> in the verb “direct” (which of course the English cannot express), some divines argue in favour of the Catholic doctrine of “homoüsion,” or <span class= "ital">substantial</span> unity of the Son with the Father: it must not, however, be too strongly pressed, or it might otherwise lead to the false notion of a <span class= "ital">personal</span> unity between Them. Nevertheless, we may admit that the prayer (or, rather, <span class= "ital">wish</span>) implies the <span class= "ital">equality</span> of the two Persons, and that it would have been inconceivable for a Catholic Christian to have used the verb in the plural. (See <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2Thessalonians 2:17</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:11-13 Prayer is religious worship, and all religious worship is due unto God only. Prayer is to be offered to God as our Father. Prayer is not only to be offered in the name of Christ, but offered up to Christ himself, as our Lord and our Saviour. Let us acknowledge God in all our ways, and he will direct our paths. Mutual love is required of all Christians. And love is of God, and is fulfilling the gospel as well as the law. We need the Spirit's influences in order to our growth in grace; and the way to obtain them, is prayer. Holiness is required of all who would go to heaven; and we must act so that we do not contradict the profession we make of holiness. The Lord Jesus will certainly come in his glory; his saints will come with him. Then the excellence as well as the necessity of holiness will appear; and without this no hearts shall be established at that day, nor shall any avoid condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now God himself - This is evidently a prayer. He earnestly sought of God that he might be permitted to visit them, and that he would so prepare the way that he might do it.<p>And our Father - Even our Father. The reference is particularly to the "Father," the First Person of the Trinity. It does not refer to the divine nature in general, or to God as such, but to God as the Father of the Lord Jesus. It is a distinct prayer offered to him that he would direct his way to them. It is right therefore to offer prayer to God as the First Person of the Trinity.<p>And our Lord Jesus Christ - This also is a prayer, as much as the former was, for it can be understood in no other way. What can be its meaning, unless the apostle believed that the Lord Jesus had power to direct his way to them, and that it was proper for him to express this wish to him; that is, to pray to him? If this be so, then it is right to pray to the Lord Jesus, or to worship him; see the <a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a> note; <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a> note. Would Paul have prayed to an angel to direct his way to the church at Thessalonica?<p>Direct our way unto you - Margin, "guide." The Greek word - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  kateuthuno&#772; - means, to guide straight toward or upon anything. It is rendered "guide," in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-79.htm">Luke 1:79</a>, and "direct" here and in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:5</a>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The idea is that or conducting one straight to a place, and not by a round-about course. Here the petition is, that God would remove all obstacles so that he could come directly to them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Translate, "May God Himself, even our Father (there being but one article in the Greek, requires this translation, 'He who is at once God and our Father'), direct," &c. The "Himself" stands in contrast with "we" (1Th 2:18); we desired to come but could not through Satan's hindrance; but if God Himself direct our way (as we pray), none can hinder Him (2Th 2:16, 17). It is a remarkable proof of the unity of the Father and Son, that in the Greek here, and in 2Th 2:16, 17, the verb is singular, implying that the subject, the Father and Son, are but one in essential Being, not in mere unity of will. Almost all the chapters in both Epistles to the Thessalonians are sealed, each with its own prayer (1Th 5:23; 2Th 1:11; 2:16; 3:5, 16) [Bengel]. Paul does not think the prosperous issue of a journey an unfit subject for prayer (Ro 1:10; 15:32) [Edmunds]. His prayer, though the answer was deferred, in about five years afterwards was fulfilled in his return to Macedonia.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here his prayer is expressed. The person to whom he prays is God himself, personally considered as God the Father, and relatively, when he styles him <span class="bld">our Father:</span> so ought believers to address themselves to God, not absolutely, but as to their Father. So Christ taught his disciples to pray: <span class="ital">Our Father; </span> and so the Spirit of adoption doth prompt the saints to pray: we come to God with greater freedom and confidence when we can come to him as a Father. And he prays also to Christ, whom he styles <span class="bld">our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> Whence we may have an argument that Christ is God, else he could not be the object of Divine worship: not that we are to present our prayers distinctly to the Son without considering his union with the Father, nor to the Father distinctly from the Son, but to the Father in and by the Lord Jesus Christ; for so only we can consider him as our Father in prayer. And he speaks of Christ also in his relation to his people: <span class="ital">our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> And the thing he prays for is, that God would direct his way unto them; that the hinderances of Satan, whatsoever they were, might be removed, and the providence of God open him a way to come to them: the word <span class="ital">direct</span> signifies in the Greek to make straight, and, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.">2 Thessalonians 3:5</a></span>, is applied to the heart: <span class="ital">The Lord direct your hearts, </span>& c., which is setting the heart straight towards God; answering to the Hebrew word <span class="ital">Jashar, </span> which signifies to be upright, and is often used in the Old Testament. The French read it, address our way. And hence we learn our duty by the apostle’s practice to pray to have our way in all cases directed by God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now God himself, and our Father,.... The Oriental versions leave out the copulative "and", and read, "God himself, our Father" the first person in the Trinity, who is God himself, truly and properly so; and who is a God that hears prayer; and who is omnipotent, and able to do more than the saints can ask or think; and omniscient, and knows their persons and cases, and what is proper for them, and how and when to help and supply them; and he is also the God of all grace, the author and giver of it, and who is able to make it abound, and increase it, and so a very proper object of prayer: and who is likewise the Father of Christ, and of all the saints, not only by creation, in which sense he is the Father of all men, but by adopting grace; and which is mentioned to encourage freedom and boldness in prayer, which children may use with a father, and to raise an expectation of succeeding and receiving an answer; for if earthly parents hear their children, and give good things to them, how much more will not our heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit, and all other good gifts, unto his children? And this shows that the apostle prayed to God in the manner Christ directed, <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a><p>and our Lord Jesus Christ: who is equally the object of prayer with God his Father and ours; who is sometimes distinctly prayed unto, as in <a href="/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a> and often in conjunction with his Father, as in all those places in the epistles, where grace and peace are wished for from them both; see <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>, and sometimes he is set before the Father, as in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:16</a> to show the entire equality between them, and that he is equally addressed as he, being truly and properly God, who knows all things, and is the Almighty, and whose grace is sufficient for us, and therefore rightly applied unto, as here: the petition put up to them both is, that they would <p>direct our way unto you: a journey is not to be taken without the will of God, without seeking to know it, without submission to it, and dependence on it; nor is there any prosperous one, but by it; see <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13</a>. Men may devise their own ways, but God directs their goings; especially a good man's steps are ordered by the Lord, and particularly ministers; who, as they are often directed to subjects and matter, in a very providential way, so to places, and are ordered both where and when to go; see <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. The apostle was aware, that there were obstacles in his way of coming to Thessalonica, for he had attempted it once and again, but Satan, and his emissaries, hindered; and therefore he desires that God and Christ would remove them out of the way, and make his way straight and plain, as the word signifies, that he might once more see their faces. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.">1 Thessalonians 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Αὐτός</span>] is not a general introductory subject to which the special designations are annexed as an apposition: “but He, God our Father,” etc. (Luther, de Wette, Hofmann, Riggenbach. According to de Wette, whom Koch and Bisping follow, <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> serves for bringing forward the contrast with the <span class="ital">petitioner</span>). But the whole designation of the subject <span class="greekheb">Αὐτὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς</span> is most closely connected: <span class="ital">But God Himself, our Father and our Lord Jesus</span>.

Paul thinks on a <span class="greekheb">κατευθύνειν τὴν ὁδόν</span>, both on <span class="ital">his</span> (man’s) side and on the side of <span class="ital">God</span>.

Only when the <span class="greekheb">κατευθύνειν</span> is undertaken by <span class="ital">God Himself</span> and <span class="ital">Christ</span> is its success assured, for then the hindrances of the devil are without power.
