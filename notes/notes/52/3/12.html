Prayer is to be offered to God as our Father. Prayer is not only to be offered in the name of Christ, but offered up to Christ himself, as our Lord and our Saviour. Let us acknowledge God in all our ways, and he will direct our paths. Mutual love is required of all Christians. And love is of God, and is fulfilling the gospel as well as the law. We need the Spirit's influences in order to our growth in grace; and the way to obtain them, is prayer. Holiness is required of all who would go to heaven; and we must act so that we do not contradict the profession we make of holiness. The Lord Jesus will certainly come in his glory; his saints will come with him. Then the excellence as well as the necessity of holiness will appear; and without this no hearts shall be established at that day, nor shall any avoid condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love - compare notes, <a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>. The word "Lord" here probably refers to the Lord Jesus, as this is the name by which he is commonly designated in the New Testament; see the notes on <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>. If this be so, then this is a petition to the Lord Jesus as the fountain of all grace and goodness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. The "you" in the Greek is emphatically put first; "But" (so the Greek for "and") what concerns "YOU," whether we come or not, "may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love," &c. The Greek for "increase" has a more positive force; that for "abound" a more comparative force, "make you full (supplying 'that which is lacking,' 1Th 3:10) and even abound." "The Lord" may here be the Holy Spirit; so the Three Persons of the Trinity will be appealed to (compare 1Th 3:13), as in 2Th 3:5. So the Holy Ghost is called "the Lord" (2Co 3:17). "Love" is the fruit of the Spirit (Ga 5:22), and His office is "to stablish in holiness" (1Th 3:13; 1Pe 1:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Increase and abound; </span> these two words denote an increasing and overflowing abundance. This is another thing he prays for; the former respected himself, this respected them. He desired to come to them to perfect that which was lacking in their faith, and he prays now for the abounding and increase of their love; not only to love one another, but <span class="ital">to increase and abound</span> in it; to increase the habits and abound in the fruits of love. They were under sore persecutions, and their love to one another was more necessary at such a time.

Though the love of Christ is especially to be looked at, and is proposed often by the apostle Paul as the great argument of love to men, yet he mentions his own love to them here to show the constancy of his affection to them though absent from them, and to show that he persuaded no duty to them but what he practised himself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord make you to increase,.... That is, the Lord the Spirit; so that the object of prayer, addressed by the apostle, is Father, Son, and Spirit, as in <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>. The Alexandrian copy reads "God". The Spirit is God, equally with the Father and the Son, and so a fit object of prayer with them, which otherwise he would not be. The request is, that he would cause these saints to increase in number, as the first churches greatly did: and in the gifts of the Spirit, which he divides to men severally as he will; and in his graces, as in faith, in hope, in holiness, in humility, in knowledge, in spiritual joy and strength, an increase in all which is from him: <p>and abound in love one towards another; for though they were taught of God to love one another, and did do so, and the apostle had had good tidings of their love; yet it was not perfect, there was room for a further exercise of it, by serving each other by it, in things spiritual and temporal; and he had his request, for it did abound in everyone of them towards each other, <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a><p>and towards all men; the men of the world, who were without, were not members of the church, nor professors of the Christian religion, but enemies to that, and to Christ, and to them; and yet they were to love them as men, and pray for them, and do them all the good that lay in their power: <p>even as we do towards you; for the love of the apostle, and those with him, abounded more and more towards these saints, and was so far from being weakened, that it was increased by their absence from them; and they were more abundantly desirous of seeing them, and were even quite impatient until they sent to them, and heard of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all <i>men</i>, even as we <i>do</i> toward you:</span><p>(3) Another part of the epistle, in which he speaks of the duties of a Christian life.

But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a> : “where Sin <span class="ital">increased</span> (or <span class="ital">multiplied</span>), Grace <span class="ital">superabounded</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But this multiplied and overflowing love is not to be confined to the brotherhood: <span class="bld">toward one another, and</span>, he adds, <span class="bld">toward all</span>. Similarly in ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm" title="See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>. For the Thessalonian Church, cruelly persecuted, this wider love was peculiarly necessary, and difficult. It meant loving their enemies, according to Christ’s command (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm" title="But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;">Matthew 5:44</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle has shewn them by his example how to love each other in Christ (see ch. <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:...">1 Thessalonians 2:7-12</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm" title="For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?...">1 Thessalonians 2:19-20</a>); and remembering this he adds, <span class="bld">even as we also toward you</span>. Comp. the appeal of Christ in <a href="/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a> (“even as I loved you”). Paul’s love too was not stationary, but living and growing. This verse has the same turn of expression as <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, “even as we also (long to see) you.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Faith</span> was the object of the Apostle’s prayer in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>; Love in ver.12; and now <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a> crowns both, as it seeks for the Thessalonians, in view of Christ’s coming, a well-assured <span class="ital">Hope</span> (comp. ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>):—<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm" title="And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">you</span>) whether we come or not.—<span class="greekheb">πλεονάσαι καὶ περισσεύσαη</span>) On the difference between these two words, comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.">2 Corinthians 4:15</a>, note.[12]—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡμεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">even we</span>) namely, even as we are full of love [towards you].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[12] <span class="greekheb">πλεονάζω</span> has a positive force: <span class="greekheb">περισσεύω</span>, the force of a comparative: The Lord <span class="ital">make you full and even abound</span>.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord.</span> By some referred to the First Person of the blessed Trinity, God our Father (Alford); by others to the Holy Ghost, as the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ are afterwards both mentioned in the prayer; but it is to be referred, according to the prevailing usage in Paul's Epistle, to the Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Make you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">you may the Lord make</span>, putting the emphasis on" you." <span class="cmt_word">To increase and abound in love one toward another;</span> toward your fellow-Christians. <span class="cmt_word">And toward all men;</span> toward the human race in general.
