<span class="ital">before, </span>or, <span class="ital">in the presence of, our God </span>— As <span class="greekheb">εμπροσθεν του Θεου ημων </span>properly signifies. Joy in the presence of God is not a carnal or worldly but a spiritual joy, such as God approves. <span class="ital">Night and day praying exceedingly </span>— That is, with great earnestness and importunity: <span class="ital">that </span>God would permit us to <span class="ital">see your face </span>— Once more in the flesh; <span class="ital">and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith — </span>Thus it appears St. Paul did not suppose that they who are once upon the rock no longer need to be taught by man! <span class="ital">Now God himself and</span> <span class="ital">our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ </span>— Here we have a plain instance of prayer being addressed to Christ as well as to the Father, and even in the same words, and at the same time. A similar instance occurs <a href="/context/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,...">2 Thessalonians 2:16-17</a>. And doubtless these petitions are addressed to him because he is God, for unless he be present everywhere, how can he hear the prayers which are everywhere put up to him by his disciples? <span class="ital">Direct </span>— Clear, or make straight; <span class="ital">our way unto you </span>— Namely, by removing those obstructions which at present remain. This prayer is founded on the supposition that the common events on which the apostle’s prosperous journey to the Thessalonians depended, were under the direction of God. The apostle, it appears, was heard in his prayer; for, as we are told (<a href="/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a>) that he gave the brethren in Macedonia <span class="ital">much exhortation, </span>we have reason to believe he did not pass by the Thessalonians, whom he was so desirous to visit. <span class="ital">And the Lord make you to increase and abound</span> — <span class="greekheb">Πλεονασαι και περισσευσα</span>, <span class="ital">to abound and overflow; in love — </span>The Lord Jesus seems to be here addressed, because all spiritual blessings which are originally from the Father come to us immediately through and from Christ, to whom belongs the office of bestowing every blessing, whether of nature, of providence, or of grace, upon his followers. The apostle’s example in praying thus fervently and importunately for his converts, well deserves to be imitated by all ministers of the gospel. <span class="ital">And toward all men, as we toward you </span>— Chandler’s remark on this passage is worthy of particular attention: “The apostle loved the Thessalonians as a father loves his children, and as a mother the infant at her breast, <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>. This his great love to them made him solicitous for their perseverance and salvation, so as to be willing to be persecuted, and to live in continual straits, (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:7</a>,) and to lose his life, (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm" title="So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>,) if it could have contributed to their perseverance in the faith, and to their eternal happiness. Generous apostle! how like the Master he served! Well therefore might he propose his own love to them as a pattern of their love to one another and to all. What an excellent religion is the Christian, which enjoins such a universal benevolence, even toward enemies and persecutors, and which roots out of the mind every tendency to anger, envy, malice, and revenge.” <span class="ital">To the end </span>— That by means of your love, which is the root of all piety and virtue; <span class="ital">he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness </span>— May make you steadfast in the experience of all Christian graces, and in the practice of all godliness and righteousness; and this <span class="ital">before God, even our Father </span>— Whose eyes are always upon you. These are high expressions when applied to fallen creatures, but what cannot the grace of God in Christ effect? <span class="ital">Ye shall be perfect, </span>says the Lord Jesus to his disciples, <span class="ital">as, </span>or <span class="ital">because, your Father in heaven is perfect. </span>And St. Paul informs us, that apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, are appointed for the work of the ministry, in order to <span class="ital">the perfecting of the saints, till they all come unto the full measure of Christ’s stature, </span><a href="/context/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;...">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>; and accordingly that they made it the great end of their preaching to <span class="ital">present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, </span><a href="/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>. <span class="ital">At the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints </span>— That you may be found such at the day of final judgment. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:6-10 Thankfulness to God is very imperfect in the present state; but one great end of the ministry of the word is to help faith forward.

First he rejoiced in their faith, and then gives thanks to God for that joy. The matter of his rejoicing was their faith, but the author and upholder of this faith was God; and in giving thanks to God for his joy, he gives thanks also to God for their faith from whence it sprang. The joy that ministers have in their people’s faith should break forth into thanksgivings. And the apostle’s thanks to God was beyond what he could return or express, as appears by the form of his speech: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For what thanks can we render?</span> &c.; as <span class="bld"><a href="/psalms/116-12.htm" title="What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits toward me?">Psalm 116:12</a></span>: <span class="ital">What shall I render unto the Lord?</span> said David.

Though this last clause, "before our God", is in the Syriac version, placed at the beginning of the next verse, according to which, it refers, not to thanks or joy before God, but to prayer before him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-9.htm" title="For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God;">1 Thessalonians 3:9</a>.
