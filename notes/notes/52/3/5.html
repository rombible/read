The apostle undoubtedly means their remembering him and his fellow-labourers with respect, as teachers sent from God; and with gratitude, as those who had given them the knowledge of the true God and of eternal life. These things are the best foundations of a respectful, grateful remembrance; for, as Chandler observes, the persons who are converted by the labours of the faithful ministers of Christ owe to their spiritual fathers their own souls; an obligation that ought not to be soon or easily forgotten. <span class="ital">Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over, </span>or concerning, <span class="ital">you </span>— The faithfulness and constancy of the people of God are a great source of comfort to their teachers. <span class="ital">For now we live </span>indeed — Our life is worth having; or, we enjoy life; <span class="ital">if, </span>or seeing that, <span class="ital">ye stand fast in the Lord </span>— Continue firm in the faith of Christ and of his grace. So great is our affection for you. In like manner, faithful ministers of the gospel, after the apostle’s example, have no higher joy than when they find their wishes, their prayers, and their labours effectual to the conversion of their people, and for their establishment in truth and grace.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 The more we find pleasure in the ways of God, the more we shall desire to persevere therein. The apostle's design was to establish and comfort the Thessalonians as to the object of their faith, that Jesus Christ was the Saviour of the world; and as to the recompence of faith, which was more than enough to make up all their losses, and to reward all their labours. But he feared his labours would be in vain. If the devil cannot hinder ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, he will, if possible, hinder the success of their labours. No one would willingly labour in vain. It is the will and purpose of God, that we enter into his kingdom through many afflictions. And the apostles, far from flattering people with the expectation of worldly prosperity in religion, told them plainly they must count upon trouble in the flesh. Herein they followed the example of their great Master, the Author of our faith. Christians were in danger, and they should be forewarned; they will thus be kept from being improved by any devices of the tempter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause - Since I knew that you were so liable to be persecuted, and since I feared that some might be turned from the truth by this opposition.<p>When I could no longer forbear - See the notes at <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>.<p>I sent to know your faith - That is, your fidelity. or your steadfastness in the gospel.<p>Lest by some means - Either by allurements to apostasy, set before you by your former pagan friends; or by the arts of false teachers; or by the severity of suffering. Satan has many methods of seducing people from the truth, and Paul was fearful that by some of his arts he might be successful there.<p>The tempter - Satan; for though the Jews were the immediate actors in those transactions, yet the apostle regarded them as being under the direction of Satan, and as accomplishing his purposes. He was, therefore, the real author of the persecutions which had been excited. He is here called the "Tempter," as he is often (compare Matt. iv.), and the truths taught are:<p>(1) that Satan is the great author of persecution; and,<p>(2) that in a time of persecution - or of trial of any kind - he endeavors to tempt people to swerve from the truth, and to abandon their religion. In persecution, people are tempted to apostatize from God, in order to avoid suffering. In afflictions of other kinds, Satan often tempts the sufferer to murmur and complain; to charge God with harshness, partiality, and severity, and to give vent to expressions that will show that religion has none of its boasted power to support the soul in the day of trial; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9-11</a>.

Translate therefore, "To know &#8230; whether haply the tempter have tempted you (the indicative implying that he supposed such was the case), and lest (in that case) our labor may prove to be in vain" (compare Ga 4:11). Our labor in preaching would in that case be vain, so far as ye are concerned, but not as concerns us in so far as we have sincerely labored (Isa 49:4; 1Co 3:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle here gives a further account of the reason why he sent Timothy to them, which was <span class="bld">to know</span> their <span class="bld">faith, </span> whether it continued stedfast under all their sufferings and temptations. He feared Satan, whom he calls <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the tempter, </span> might have some way or other <span class="ital">tempted</span> them, either by false teachers to seduce them, or by sufferings to affright them. He was more concerned about the inward state of their souls, than their outward condition; and commonly temptations go along with persecutions. And the apostle, having bestowed great <span class="ital">labour</span> upon them, feared lest it might <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">be in vain, </span> that the tempter had prevailed. Satan’s first work is to keep men from believing, his next is to destroy their faith: young converts are commonly most assaulted. Paul’s heart was therefore very solicitous for them, so that (as he said before) he could not any longer forbear sending to know how it was with them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear,.... Or "bear" the above vehement desire of seeing them, or of hearing from them. Here the apostle speaks in the singular number, and seems to intimate, as if what was said before of the like kind is to be understood singly of him; for these words are a repetition and summary of the foregoing, with some diversity: <p>I sent to know your faith; how it stood, whether it was staggering through these afflictions, or firm; whether it was weak or strong, what was wanting in it; and whether it grew and increased. The Arabic version adds, "and charity"; for of this, as well as of faith, Timothy brought an account, as appears from the following verse. <p>Lest by some means the tempter; Satan, so called from his common and constant employ in tempting men to sin; see <a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a><p>have tempted you with success, and got an advantage over them, improving these afflictions to such a purpose as to move them from the hope of the Gospel, and relinquish the profession of it; for otherwise there was no question to be made but he had tempted them, or solicited them to it; for none of the saints are free from his temptations; the apostle himself was not, nor indeed our Lord Jesus Christ: but the apostle's fears were, lest he should so have tempted them as to have gained upon them, and have persuaded them to have turned their backs upon the Gospel, and not expose their name and credit, and hazard the toss of worldly substance, and even life itself, for the sake of it. <p>And our labour be in vain: in preaching the Gospel among them; not with respect to God, to whom the word never returns void and empty; nor with regard to the apostles, whose judgment was with the Lord, and their work with their God, who will of his own grace reward them; but with respect to the Thessalonians, to whom, should Satan gain his point, it would be of no use and service, for which the concern was. The Ethiopic version reads, "and your labour be in vain": in receiving the apostles, embracing and professing the Gospel, and suffering for it; see <a href="/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a> but the common reading is best, and agrees with what the apostle elsewhere says, <a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο</span>] <span class="ital">on this account, i.e.</span> on account of the actual commencement of trouble.

Thus a relation must be contained in it to <span class="ital">other</span> persons. Schott, whom Olshausen follows, supposes these others the Thessalonians, finding the thought expressed: “as <span class="ital">ye</span>, in consequence of the troubles which befell me, were anxious for <span class="ital">me</span>, so I <span class="ital">also</span> could no longer bear to be without information concerning <span class="ital">you</span>.” But, according to the connection (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγένετο καὶ οἴδατε</span>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm" title="For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>), a relation must be contained in <span class="greekheb">κἀγώ</span> to others, of whom, as of Paul, a <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι στέγειν</span> in respect of the Thessalonians is asserted.[47] These others are the Christian circle with the apostle in Athens (<a href="/acts/17-34.htm" title="However, certain men joined to him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.">Acts 17:34</a>), including Timotheus sent from it to Thessalonica. Events such as befell the Thessalonians must have awakened lively sympathy in <span class="ital">every</span> Christian who heard of them. Entirely perverted is the view of Hofmann, who takes the singular, <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>, as a contrast to the plural, <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>.

He accordingly infers, that besides Timotheus, sent by Paul and Silvanus jointly to Thessalonica, there was another sent specially by Paul. After Timotheus was on his journey to strengthen the Thessalonian Church against the persecution which had broken out upon them, Paul, at a time when Silvanus was also absent, sent a second, this time for his own sake; his own troubled condition making the want of news from Thessalonica insupportable, lest perhaps the fruit of his labours among them might be entirely lost. Yet before the return of this unknown messenger Silvanus and also Timotheus had rejoined the apostle!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ γνῶναι</span>] <span class="ital">in order to learn</span>, belongs to the subject of the verb <span class="greekheb">ἔπεμψα</span>; thus: “in order that I, the sender, might learn;” not: in order that he (Timotheus) might learn (Pelt, Olshausen, and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν</span>] <span class="ital">your faith, i.e.</span> how it is with it, how it stands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μήπως</span>] depends on <span class="greekheb">γνῶναι</span>, not on <span class="greekheb">ἔπεμψα</span>, and is the introductory particle of an indirect question: <span class="ital">whether perhaps the tempter has tempted you</span>.

The aorist indicative refers to a fact which possibly may have already happened; but the conjunctive <span class="greekheb">γένηται</span> refers to a fact which belongs to the future, and is conceived as a consequence of the first fact. Fritzsche (<span class="ital">Opusc. Fritzschiorum</span>, p. 176), to whom de Wette and Koch adhere, explains it: ut … cognoscerem, <span class="ital">an forte</span> Satanas vos tentasset et <span class="ital">ne forte</span> labores mei irriti essent. He thus takes <span class="greekheb">μήπως</span> in the first clause as an interrogative particle, and in the second clause as an expression of fear; an explanation which Winer rightly designates as harsh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Moreover, incorrectly, Whitby, Macknight, Baumgarten-Crusius: in <span class="greekheb">ἐπείρασεν</span> is implied “tempted with success,” “seduced.” The idea of seduction exists only by the addition of <span class="greekheb">εἰς κενὸν γένηται</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[47] It might otherwise be assumed that Paul here anticipates what he first, in ver. 6, observes of the Thessalonians, namely, that <span class="ital">they also</span> had a longing for him; and thus <span class="greekheb">κἀγώ</span>, which belongs to <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι στέγων</span>, not to <span class="greekheb">ἔπεμψα</span>, is explained. But this is an expedient which is artificial, and is to be rejected because <span class="greekheb">μηκέτι στέγειν</span>, ver. 5, and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιποθεῖν</span>, ver. 6, are not co-extensive ideas.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>.

St Paul repeats what he said in <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm" title="Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, but in a different manner, there stating the facts themselves, here indicating his own share in the trouble of his readers: “You were in affliction, and your faith endangered; and I too felt for you an unendurable anxiety.” He has just spoken of Timothy as sent to comfort <span class="ital">them</span>, but he was sent at the same time to comfort <span class="ital">him</span> (the Apostle), to relieve his distressing fears about them (see <span class="ital"><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a> b</span> and 6). His own troubles and despondency at Corinth helped to make him apprehensive for the Thessalonian Church (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:7</a>, and comp. <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>; <a href="/context/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:...">Acts 18:9-10</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/2-3.htm" title="And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Greek verb for “know” in this clause is different from that employed in the last; it means <span class="ital">to ascertain, get to know</span>—<span class="bld">that I might ascertain your faith</span>—“might learn its condition, and know whether or not you were still standing fast in the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lest by some means the tempter have tempted you</span>] “Have” is here the English subjunctive perfect, modern “should have”; but the Greek verb is indicative, and implies a positive expectation: <span class="ital">lest by any means the tempter had tempted you</span> (R. V.)—a fact of which there was little doubt; the apprehension is revealed in the next clause (Greek subjunctive),—<span class="ital">and our labour should prove in vain</span>. This was the dark thought which crossed the Apostle’s mind, that he could “no longer bear.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This “labour” (or “toil,” same word as in ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>, see note, and ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) is that which St Paul described pathetically in ch. <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm" title="For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:...">1 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>, beginning with the “entrance” that certainly “was not vain.” To think that all this labour might be lost, and a success at first so glorious end in blank failure!—The sentence might be rendered quite as grammatically, and more vividly, in the <span class="ital">interrogative</span>, expressing the apprehension as it actually arose in the Apostle’s mind: <span class="bld">I sent that I might know about your faith: had the Tempter haply tempted you, and would our labour prove in vain</span>?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The Tempter” is so styled once besides, in the account of Christ’s Temptation, <a href="/matthew/4-3.htm" title="And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.">Matthew 4:3</a>.

The temptation to which the Thessalonians were exposed was that of apostasy from Christianity, through the fear or endurance of persecution. That the tempter had tempted them is probable  - it was almost unavoidable; that he had succeeded in his temptation, and had thus rendered the apostle's labors among them useless, was uncertain - a contingency which might possibly have taken place. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The tempter (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here and <a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>. lxx.
