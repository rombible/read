(without an article). By <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΛΊΨΙς</span></span></span> Schott understands the tribulation caused by the Corinthian adversaries of the apostle; and by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΆΓΚΗ</span></span></span>, either sickness or (so also Macknight) pecuniary indigence, combined with hard labour; whilst Bouman (<span class="ital">Chartae theolog.</span> I. p. 80) considers “<span class="greekheb">ἀνάγκην</span> vocabulum <span class="ital">generale</span> esse, quod nullum non <span class="ital">calamitatum</span> genus contineat; <span class="greekheb">θλίψιν</span> de <span class="ital">oppressionibus singulatim</span> dici ac <span class="ital">persecutionibus</span>, quibus Christianos vel Ethnici vexarent vel Judaei.” These special determinations or limitations are certainly precarious; still so much is certain, that <span class="greekheb">ἀνάγκη</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΛΊΨΙς</span></span></span> cannot here be interpreted, with de Wette and Koch, of care and anxiety, but are to be understood of <span class="ital">external necessity and tribulation</span>. For the care and anxiety of the apostle could only, according to the context, refer to the Thessalonians, and must have been <span class="ital">removed</span> by the message of Timotheus. But <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> imports that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΆΓΚΗ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΛΊΨΙς</span></span></span> of the apostle <span class="ital">continued</span> in spite of the glad message of Timotheus; on the other hand, by reason of it they were no longer esteemed or felt by the apostle as an evil (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a>). For the thought can only be: We were comforted <span class="ital">during</span>, or <span class="ital">in spite of</span>, the heavy burden of necessity and tribulation which <span class="ital">weighs upon us</span>, consequently still rests upon us.

But while its reference there was to the <span class="ital">peril</span> of the tempted Thessalonians causing the Apostle intense anxiety, here it is to their <span class="ital">loyalty and affection</span> bringing him a corresponding joy. For a similar instance, comp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;...">2 Corinthians 7:6-7</a> : “He that comforteth the downcast, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus … and in the comfort with which he was comforted over you,” &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the verb “comfort” see note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in all our affliction and distress</span>] <span class="bld">distress and affliction</span> (R.

The first of these terms, as e.g. in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1 Corinthians 9:16</a> (“Necessity is laid upon me”), implies <span class="ital">outward constraint, stress of circumstances</span>, or sometimes <span class="ital">of duty</span>; while the second (see ch. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm" title="And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto....">1 Thessalonians 3:3-4</a>) commonly denotes <span class="ital">trouble from men</span>. For similar and more extended combinations, see <a href="/2_corinthians/6-4.htm" title="But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,">2 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The preposition is literally <span class="bld">over</span> (as in last clause), not <span class="ital">in</span>. It was not simply that Timothy’s tidings brought comfort to the Apostle <span class="ital">amidst</span> his present trials; but this comfort <span class="ital">bore upon</span> those trials. The steadfastness of the Thessalonians heartened him to meet his troubles at Corinth. This effect of Silas and Timothy’s arrival “from Macedonia” is hinted in <a href="/acts/18-5.htm" title="And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.">Acts 18:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we were comforted</span> … <span class="bld">through your faith</span> (R.

Their “faith” was the essential point, that about which Timothy was sent to enquire (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm" title="For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>); if this remained, all would go well. So our Lord prayed for Peter, “That <span class="ital">thy faith</span> fail not” (<a href="/luke/22-32.htm" title="But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.">Luke 22:32</a>). “By faith ye stand” (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you stand.">2 Corinthians 1:24</a>; see next verse).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-7.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τῆς</span>—<span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>, <span class="ital">by—faith</span>) Construe this with <span class="greekheb">παρεκλήθημεν</span>, <span class="ital">we were comforted</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you</span> - with reference to you - <span class="cmt_word">in all our affliction and distress.</span> Some refer "affliction" to outward troubles, and "distress" to internal evils - referring the one to the persecutions arising from his Corinthian opponents, and the other to his bodily infirmity (Koch). Such a distinction is, however, precarious. The words do not refer to the apostle's anxiety on account of the Thessalonians, for that was removed by the coming of Timothy. Clearly some external trouble is denoted. Paul, when he preached the gospel at Corinth, and before he obtained the protection of Gallio, was exposed to much persecution and danger. The Jews had expelled him from their synagogue (<a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>), and attempts had been made against him which at length broke out into an insurrection against him, when he was dragged before the Roman tribunal (<a href="/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>). His condition at Corinth when he wrote this Epistle was dark and gloomy. <span class="cmt_word">By your faith</span>; by the steadfastness of your faith. The good news which Timothy brought of the faith and love of the Thessalonians comforted the apostle amid all the trials and difficulties and disappointments of his ministry (comp. with this passage <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4-7</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Affliction (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Rev. distress.
