Their doctrinal views as to the nearness of Christ's coming, and as to the state of those who had fallen asleep, and their practice in some points, needed correction (1Th 4:1-9). Paul's method was to begin by commending what was praiseworthy, and then to correct what was amiss; a good pattern to all admonishers of others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> We have here the last effect of Timothy’s message upon the apostle, it put him upon prayer for these Thessalonians; expressed by the assiduity of it, <span class="ital">night and day, </span>& c., that is, in a constant course; as we noted before, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a></span>. And by the fervency of it, <span class="bld">exceedingly, </span> or excessively. The Greek word cannot well be Englished, yet is often used by the apostle when he would express any thing with an emphasis, as <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm" title="Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,">Ephesians 3:20</a></span>, and in this Epistle, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm" title="And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.

Though the apostle had before commended their faith, yet there was something lacking in it. No faith is made perfect at first; yea, the best faith may have some defects. And the word is used elsewhere to signify something that is wanting, or left behind, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/16-17.htm" title="I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.">1 Corinthians 16:17</a> <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a></span>. And their faith might be defective: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. As to the matter of it, some mysteries of faith they might not yet understand; as the disciples did not, till after Christ’s ascension; and some of the Corinthians a while doubted the doctrine of the resurrection, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:12</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

As to the lively operations and fruits of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The former defects are removed by doctrine, the last by exhortation and comfort, and the apostle desired to see their face on the account of both: and to <span class="bld">perfect</span> a thing is to make it complete, both as to parts and degrees. The word here used we find often in the New Testament, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="Finally, brothers, farewell.

This good news, not only comforted their hearts, and revived their spirits, and filled them with joy and thankfulness, but also sent them to the throne of grace to pray without ceasing, continually, night and day, and as often as they went thither, and that with great fervency and earnestness, in a multitude of petitions; or, as the Arabic version renders it, "with prayers exceeding a multitude"; with innumerable requests: <p>that we might see your face: once more, and converse face to face: <p>and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? in the grace of faith; for though they remembered their work of faith with pleasure, and had had good tidings of it very lately, and were thankful that it grew exceedingly as it did, yet they knew it was not perfect, there was unbelief attending them: and though it is God's work to increase faith, as well as to produce it, yet, as the ministry of the word is the means of the first planting of it, so it also is of the increase of it. This may likewise be understood of the doctrine of faith, which though they had received in the love of it, and had made considerable progress in their knowledge of it; yet they knew but in part, and needed to be taught the way of God, and truths of the Gospel more perfectly; and the ministry of the word is for the perfecting of the saints in the knowledge of the Son of God, and of other truths; wherefore the apostle desired greatly to see them, that he might be an instrument of instructing them, more perfectly in the knowledge of divine things; and in this, and in the following epistle, he does particularly instruct them about the rise and fall of antichrist, the coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead, articles of faith in which they seemed to have been deficient: but now, though these saints had deficiencies in their faith, yet they were not what the Jews call (o) , "such as are deficient in faith", or want faith entirely, a phrase somewhat like this which is here used. <p>(o) Maimon.

The connection of <span class="greekheb">δεόμενοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. with the foregoing words is loose, but probably may be found in the vivid realisation of the Thessalonians called up before his mind as he praised God for their constancy. Timothy had told him of their loyalty, but had evidently acquainted him also with some less promising tendencies and shortcomings in the church; possibly the Thessalonians had even asked for guidance on certain matters of belief and practice (see below). Hence Paul’s eagerness to be on the spot again, not merely for the sake of happy fellowship (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>), but to educate and guide his friends, supplying what was defective in their faith. As this was impracticable in the meantime, he proceeds to write down some kindly admonitions. Thus 10<span class="ital">b</span> forms the transition to the second part of the letter; Paul, as usual, is wise enough to convey any correction or remonstrance on the back of hearty commendation. In the prayer which immediately follows, 10<span class="ital">a</span> is echoed in 11, 10<span class="ital">b</span> in 12, 13, for the maturing of the Thessalonian’s faith does not depend on the presence of their apostles.

Hence the teaching and admonition the Apostle supplies in chaps. 4, 5 and in the Second Epistle (see <span class="ital">Introd</span>. pp. 23–25). Timothy’s return from Thessalonica and the news he brought, while removing St Paul’s great anxiety, made him still more sensible of the need this young and most promising Church had for the continued instruction which he alone could supply. This increased his eagerness to revisit the Thessalonians. For a similar wish—less warmly expressed, inasmuch as it concerned strangers—see <a href="/context/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;...">Romans 1:9-15</a>; <a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word rendered “perfect” means to <span class="ital">fit up, furnish, fully equip</span>; it is used of “<span class="ital">mending</span> nets” (<a href="/matthew/4-21.htm" title="And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.">Matthew 4:21</a>), of “vessels <span class="ital">fitted</span> for destruction” (<a href="/romans/9-22.htm" title="What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:">Romans 9:22</a>), and of “<span class="ital">perfecting</span> saints for work of ministration” (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Νυκτὸς</span>, <span class="ital">night</span>) Alluding to his holy thoughts during the night, <a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2 Timothy 1:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ ὑστερήματα</span>, <span class="ital">the things which are wanting</span>) [the deficiency, that which is lacking].

It was defective in extent; they were ignorant of many of the doctrines of the gospel, and had formed erroneous views of other doctrines, such as the second advent. It was defective in application; they had not yet renounced all the corrupt practices of their former heathen life, nor had they embodied all the precepts of the gospel into their actual life. The Thessalonians were as yet but novices. So also the reason which impelled Paul to wish to come to Rome was to supply that which was lacking in the faith of the Roman converts (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>). Confirmation was a work in which the apostle delighted, being both important and desirable. In general, faith at first is weak and defective; it is only developed by degrees. Especially is it increased by every increase of spiritual knowledge. "Add to your faith knowledge" (<a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5, 6</a>). The remark of Calvin is worthy of attention: "Paul is desirous of having the opportunity given him of supplying what is wanting in the faith of the Thessalonians, or, which is the same thing, completing in all its parts their faith which was as yet imperfect. Yet this is the faith which he had previously extolled marvelously. From this we infer that those who far surpass others are still far distant from the goal. Hence, whatever progress we may have made, let us keep in view our deficiencies, that we may not be reluctant to aim at something further." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Exceedingly (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>.
