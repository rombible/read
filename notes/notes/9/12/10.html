The temple of Baal-shemesh, the Sun god, at Carthage, was renowned in that luxurious and splendid city. (For a detailed and picturesque account of the worship and ritual of Baal at Carthage, see M. Gustave Flaubert’s romance of <span class= "ital">Salômbo.</span>) Baal and Ashtaroth, the Greek Astarté, were probably originally worshipped simply as the sun and moon.

Samuel reasons of the righteous acts of the Lord. Those who follow God faithfully, he will enable to continue following him. Disobedience would certainly be the ruin of Israel. We mistake if we think that we can escape God's justice, by trying to shake off his dominion. If we resolve that God shall not rule us, yet he will judge us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According to the present arrangement of the Book of Judges, and the common chronology, the oppression of Sisera must have occurred about 200 years after the entrance into Canaan. But Samuel here places it as the first great servitude, before that under Eglon king of Moab, or that from which Shamgar delivered them. And this is in accordance with the internal evidence of the Book of Judges itself. It is also the order of <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11</a>, except that there the Ammonites <a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a> are placed before the Philistines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-16.

And in confirmation of those statements, no less than in evidence of the divine displeasure, a remarkable phenomenon, on the invocation of the prophet, and of which he gave due premonition, took place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they cried unto the Lord,....
