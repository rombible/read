The word is singular, he "said" or answered (g), that is, Israel said, the whole body of the people, they all replied as one man: the reason why Samuel made such a speech at this time, when he resigned his government to Saul, was not only to secure his own character, but to suggest to Saul how he should rule and govern according to his example; and that having established his own character, he could the more freely, and with the better grace, reprove the people for their sin, as in some following verses. <p>(g) "et dixit", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus; Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto them, The LORD <i>is</i> witness against you, and his <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> anointed <i>is</i> witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.

In what the renewal consisted is not clearly stated; but it is simply recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a> that "they (the whole people) made Saul king there before the Lord in Gilgal." Many commentators have supposed that he was anointed afresh, and appeal to David's second anointing (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>). But David's example merely proves as Seb. Schmidt has correctly observed, that the anointing could be repeated under certain circumstances; but it does not prove that it was repeated, or must have been repeated, in the case of Saul. If the ceremony of anointing had been performed, it would no doubt have been mentioned, just as it is in <a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>. But &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; does not mean "they anointed," although the lxx have rendered it &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, according to their own subjective interpretation. The renewal of the monarchy may very well have consisted in nothing more than a solemn confirmation of the election that had taken place at Mizpeh, in which Samuel once more laid before both king and people the right of the monarchy, receiving from both parties in the presence of the Lord the promise to observe this right, and sealing the vow by a solemn sacrifice. The only sacrifices mentioned are zebachim shelamim, i.e., peace-offerings. These were thank-offerings, which were always connected with a sacrificial meal, and when presented on joyous occasions, formed a feast of rejoicing for those who took part, since the sacrificial meal shadowed forth a living and peaceful fellowship with the Lord. Gilgal is in all probability the place where Samuel judged the people every year (<a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). But whether it was the Gilgal in the plain of the Jordan, or Jiljilia on higher ground to the south-west of Shiloh, it is by no means easy to determine. The latter is favoured, apart from the fact that Samuel did not say "Let us go down," but simply "Let us go" (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>), by the circumstance that the solemn ceremony took place after the return from the war at Jabesh; since it is hardly likely that the people would have gone down into the valley of the Jordan to Gilgal, whereas Jiljilia was close by the road from Jabesh to Gibeah and Ramah. </body></html>
