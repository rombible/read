As the boy grew up to manhood, we hear that while, on the one hand, as, no doubt, in earlier days with Eli, so now with Samuel, the Lord was with His servant, giving him strength and wisdom, guiding him and guarding him; and, on the other, different from Eli, we hear how the young prophet let none of the Divine words fall to the ground. In those dark days of sin and shame at Shiloh, in the midst of scenes of temptation, the boy stood firm; his early life was a perpetual protest against covetousness and iniquity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm" title="And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.">1 Samuel 3:19</a>. <span class="ital">The Lord was with him — </span>There were manifest tokens of God’s presence with him, and favour toward him.

Samuel is a proof that their waiting upon the Lord will be pleasing to him.

The three successive calls addressed to the boy convinced Eli of the divine character of the speaker, and he therefore exhorted the child to give a reverential attention to the message. The burden of [the Lord's message] was an extraordinary premonition of the judgments that impended over Eli's house; and the aged priest, having drawn the painful secret from the child, exclaimed, "It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good." Such is the spirit of meek and unmurmuring submission in which we ought to receive the dispensations of God, however severe and afflictive. But, in order to form a right estimate of Eli's language and conduct on this occasion, we must consider the overwhelming accumulation of judgments denounced against his person, his sons, his descendants&#8212;his altar, and nation. With such a threatening prospect before him, his piety and meekness were wonderful. In his personal character he seems to have been a good man, but his sons' conduct was flagrantly bad; and though his misfortunes claim our sympathy, it is impossible to approve or defend the weak and unfaithful course which, in the retributive justice of God, brought these adversities upon him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Samuel grew, </span> as in stature, so in wisdom and piety, and God’s favour, and reputation with the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fall to the ground, </span> i.e. want its effect or success; God made good all his predictions.
