The sleeping child is awakened by a voice uttering his name. He naturally supposes it is his half-blind old master summoning him. The same thing occurs a second and a third time. Then it flashed upon Eli the boy had had no dream. We can well fancy the old man, when Samuel again came in, asking, “Where did the voice you thought was mine come from?” and the boy would reply, “From your chamber, master.” And the old high priest would remember that in the same direction, only at the extremity of the sanctuary, behind the veil, was the Ark and the seat of God. Was, then, the glory of the Lord shining there? and did the voice as in old days proceed from that sacred golden throne? Se he bade his pupil go to his chamber again, and if the voice spoke to him again, to answer, not Eli, but the invisible King—“Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-10 The call which Divine grace designs shall be made effectual; will be repeated till it is so, till we come to the call. Eli, perceiving that it was the voice of God that Samuel heard, instructed him what to say. Though it was a disgrace to Eli, for God's call to be directed to Samuel, yet he told him how to meet it. Thus the elder should do their utmost to assist and improve the younger that are rising up. Let us never fail to teach those who are coming after us, even such as will soon be preferred before us, Joh 1:30. Good words should be put into children's mouths betimes, by which they may be prepared to learn Divine things, and be trained up to regard them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Did not yet know the Lord - i. e. in His supernatural communication, as follows at the end of the verse. The text rendering of this verse is better than that of the margin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-18. he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me&#8212;It is evident that his sleeping chamber was close to that of the aged high priest and that he was accustomed to be called during the night. The three successive calls addressed to the boy convinced Eli of the divine character of the speaker, and he therefore exhorted the child to give a reverential attention to the message. The burden of [the Lord's message] was an extraordinary premonition of the judgments that impended over Eli's house; and the aged priest, having drawn the painful secret from the child, exclaimed, "It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good." Such is the spirit of meek and unmurmuring submission in which we ought to receive the dispensations of God, however severe and afflictive. But, in order to form a right estimate of Eli's language and conduct on this occasion, we must consider the overwhelming accumulation of judgments denounced against his person, his sons, his descendants&#8212;his altar, and nation. With such a threatening prospect before him, his piety and meekness were wonderful. In his personal character he seems to have been a good man, but his sons' conduct was flagrantly bad; and though his misfortunes claim our sympathy, it is impossible to approve or defend the weak and unfaithful course which, in the retributive justice of God, brought these adversities upon him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He arose and went to Eli; </span> he persists in the same readiness to obey and serve him and was not discouraged or driven from his duty by his double mistake and disappointment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Eli perceived, </span> by the consideration of Samuel’s piety, of the sanctity of the place adjoining, from whence God had oft-times spoken, and of the solitude of the place, where there was no human person besides himself who could or would have called Samuel in that manner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord called Samuel again the third time,.... In the same manner he had done before, expressing his name no doubt: <p>and he arose and went to Eli, and said, here am I, for thou didst call me; as if he should say, it must certainly be so, I cannot be mistaken a third time: <p>and Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child; he was satisfied now that Samuel must have heard a voice, and he knew there was no man in the tabernacle but himself, and therefore it must be the voice of the Lord out of the most holy place; and he had formerly been acquainted with such voices, and used to them, and now called them to mind; and besides, as Aben Ezra observes, he was the rather confirmed in this, that the Lord called Samuel, because Samuel heard the voice, and not Eli, though Eli lay nearer the most holy place than Samuel did; which showed that this must be the voice of prophecy the Lord makes whom he pleases to hear; and that Eli might be fully persuaded of this, before the matter of the prophecy was delivered to him, Samuel was so often directed to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD called Samuel again the third time.

Possibly he recalled to mind the visit of the man of God, and had some presage of what the message might be. At all events he bade Samuel lie calmly down again, because the best preparation for hearing God's voice is obedience and trustful submission. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The word of the Lord was then issued for the first time to Samuel. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2-4</a> form one period. The clause, "it came to pass at that time" (<a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a>), is continued in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>, "that the Lord called," etc. The intervening clauses from &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; to &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; are circumstantial clauses, intended to throw light upon the situation. The clause, "Eli was laid down in his place," etc., may be connected logically with "at that time" by the insertion of "when" (as in the English version: Tr.). The dimness of Eli's eyes is mentioned, to explain Samuel's behaviour, as afterwards described. Under these circumstances, for example, when Samuel heard his own name called out in sleep, he might easily suppose that Eli was calling him to render some assistance. The "lamp of God" is the light of the candlestick in the tabernacle, the seven lamps of which were put up and lighted every evening, and burned through the night till all the oil was consumed (see <a href="/exodus/30-8.htm">Exodus 30:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>, and the explanation given at <a href="/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>). The statement that this light was not yet extinguished, is equivalent to "before the morning dawn." "And Samuel was lying (sleeping) in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was." &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; does not mean the holy place, as distinguished from the "most holy," as in <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>,<p>(Note: The Masoretes have taken &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; in this sense, and therefore have placed the Athnach under &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; rednu, to separate &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; from &#1497;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, and thus to guard against the conclusion, which might be drawn from this view of &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; that Samuel slept in the holy place.)<p>but the whole tabernacle, the tent with its court, as the palace of the God-king, as in <a href="/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>. Samuel neither slept in the holy place by the side of the candlestick and table of shew-bread, nor in the most holy place in front of the ark of the covenant, but in the court, where cells were built for the priests and Levites to live in when serving at the sanctuary (see at <a href="/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a>). "The ark of God, i.e., the ark of the covenant, is mentioned as the throne of the divine presence, from which the call to Samuel proceeded.</body></html>
