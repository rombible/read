Neither the death of the warrior priests, Hophni and Phinehas, nor the crushing defeat of the Hebrew army, would have so powerfully affected the people; but that the sacred symbol of the presence and protection of the invisible King should be allowed to fall into the hands of the uncircumcised Philistines, the hereditary foes of the chosen race, was a calamity unparalleled in their annals.<p>It seemed to say that God had indeed forsaken them.<p>The expression is a very singular one, and re-occurs in <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.">2Kings 21:12</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/19-3.htm" title="And say, Hear you the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil on this place, the which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle.">Jeremiah 19:3</a>, on the occasion of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.">1 Samuel 3:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Both the ears of every one shall tingle — </span>Or, as we would express it, <span class="ital">It shall stun all that hear it. </span>This was awfully fulfilled, when the doleful news came that the ark was taken, and both Eli’s sons were slain, and when Eli himself fell down and broke his neck.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:11-18 What a great deal of guilt and corruption is there in us, concerning which we may say, It is the iniquity which our own heart knoweth; we are conscious to ourselves of it! Those who do not restrain the sins of others, when it is in their power to do it, make themselves partakers of the guilt, and will be charged as joining in it. In his remarkable answer to this awful sentence, Eli acknowledged that the Lord had a right to do as he saw good, being assured that he would do nothing wrong. The meekness, patience, and humility contained in those words, show that he was truly repentant; he accepted the punishment of his sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>More accurately, "the which whosoever heareth both his ears shall tingle." This expressive phrase occurs again twice (marginal references) with reference to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. It is remarkable that Jeremiah repeatedly compares the destruction of Jerusalem with the destruction of Shiloh (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/26-9.htm">Jeremiah 26:9</a>; Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60-64</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-18. he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me&#8212;It is evident that his sleeping chamber was close to that of the aged high priest and that he was accustomed to be called during the night. The three successive calls addressed to the boy convinced Eli of the divine character of the speaker, and he therefore exhorted the child to give a reverential attention to the message. The burden of [the Lord's message] was an extraordinary premonition of the judgments that impended over Eli's house; and the aged priest, having drawn the painful secret from the child, exclaimed, "It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good." Such is the spirit of meek and unmurmuring submission in which we ought to receive the dispensations of God, however severe and afflictive. But, in order to form a right estimate of Eli's language and conduct on this occasion, we must consider the overwhelming accumulation of judgments denounced against his person, his sons, his descendants&#8212;his altar, and nation. With such a threatening prospect before him, his piety and meekness were wonderful. In his personal character he seems to have been a good man, but his sons' conduct was flagrantly bad; and though his misfortunes claim our sympathy, it is impossible to approve or defend the weak and unfaithful course which, in the retributive justice of God, brought these adversities upon him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will do a thing:</span> those things which are related in the next chapter, which though done by the Philistines, God here ascribes to himself, because he was the first and chief cause of it, by withdrawing his helping hand from Israel, and by delivering the ark, and Eli’s two sons, and the rest of people, into his and their enemies’ hands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle; </span> which will be so terrible, that not only those that feel it shall groan under it, but those that only hear the report of it shall be struck with such amazement and horror, which will make their heads and hearts ache. A metaphor from him, who being surprised with some great and hideous noise, such as thunder or great guns, his head is much affected with it, and the sound or tingling of it abides in his ears a good while after it.

In the latter passage there may be a tacit reference to this passage, suggesting a comparison between the destruction of Shiloh and the destruction of Jerusalem, such as is found elsewhere in Jeremiah (<a href="/context/1_samuel/7-12.htm" title="Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Till now has the LORD helped us....">1 Samuel 7:12-14</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/26-6.htm" title="Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?

And such an event was the capture of the ark, and the barbarous destruction of the priests and sanctuary at Shiloh. The phrase is again used of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>), a calamity which Jeremiah compares to the fall of Shiloh (<a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12, 14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6, 9</a>), inasmuch as both of these events in-valved the ruin of the central seat of the Jewish religion, and were both accompanied by revolting cruelties. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As soon as Samuel heard his name called out, he hastened to Eli to receive his commands. But Eli bade him lie down again, as he had not called him. At first, no doubt, he thought the call which Samuel had heard was nothing more than a false impression of the youth, who had been fast asleep. But the same thing was repeated a second and a third time; for, as the historian explains in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-6.htm">1 Samuel 3:6</a>, "Samuel had not yet known Jehovah, and (for) the word of Jehovah was not yet revealed to him." (The perfect &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; after &#1496;&#1512;&#1501;, though very rare, is fully supported by <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/8-25.htm">Proverbs 8:25</a>, and therefore is not to be altered into &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;, as Dietrich and Bttcher propose.) He therefore imagined again that Eli had called him. But when he came to Eli after the third call, Eli perceived that the Lord was calling, and directed Samuel, if the call were repeated, to answer, "Speak, Lord; for Thy servant heareth." </body></html>
