It is rarely found in the other historical books. “Sons of Belial” signifies, then, merely “sons of worthlessness,” worthless, good-for-nothing men. The <span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary </span>ingeniously accounts for the use of Belial in the English Version here, and in other places in the Old Testament, by referring to the contrast drawn by St. Paul between Christ and Belial, as if Belial were the name of an idol. or the personification of evil (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2Corinthians 6:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">They knew not the Lord.</span>—The whole conduct of these high priestly officials showed they were utter unbelievers. They used their sacred position merely as affording an opportunity for their selfish extortions; and, as is so often the case now, as it was then, their unbelief was the source of their moral worthlessness (see <a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm" title="Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Samuel 2:22</a>). “Hophni and Phinehas (the two sons of Eli) are, for students of ecclesiastical history, eminently suggestive characters.

It was the dances and assemblies of the women in the vineyards and before the sacred feast that gave occasion for their debaucheries. They were the worst development of the lawlessness of the age, penetrating, as in the case of the wandering Levite of the Book of Judges, into the most sacred offices.<p>“But the coarseness of these vices does not make the moral less pointed for all times. The three-pronged fork which fishes up the seething flesh is the earliest type of grasping at pluralities and Church preferments by base means, the open profligacy at the door of the Tabernacle is the type of many a scandal brought on the Christian Church by the selfishness or sensuality of the ministers.”—Dean Stanley, <span class= "ital">On the Jewish Churchy </span>Lecture 17, Part I.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:11-26 Samuel, being devoted to the Lord in a special manner, was from a child employed about the sanctuary in the services he was capable of. As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sons of Belial - See the marginal reference note.

In the New Testament, Paul contrasts Christ and Belial, as if Belial were the name of an idol or the personification of evil <a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>.

Though professionally engaged in sacred duties, they were not only strangers to the power of religion in the heart, but they had thrown off its restraints, and even ran, as is sometimes done in similar cases by the sons of eminent ministers, to the opposite extreme of reckless and open profligacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> To wit, practically, i.e. they did not acknowledge honour, regard, love, or serve God; for so words of knowledge are commonly used in Scripture: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a> <a href="/1_corinthians/15-34.htm" title="Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.">1 Corinthians 15:34</a> <a href="/titus/1-16.htm" title="They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.">Titus 1:16</a></span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial,....

The next words, in ver. 13, are difficult, but lit. mean, "The legal right of the priests, towards, or as respects, the people." On this account the Vulgate and several commentators couple the sentence with what precedes: "they knew neither Jehovah, nor their own legal rights." But the word <span class="accented">also</span> in ver. 15 is incompatible with this rendering; for if what is mentioned there be illegal, so must also the practice be which is recorded here. But neither does <span class="accented">custom</span> give the sense; for the Hebrews has not priest's (sing.) as the A.V., but <span class="accented">of the priests</span>, of all priests generally, and not of Eli merely and his sons. The right translation is that given by the Sept., Syriac, and Chaldee, namely, "the due of the priests from the people," on which see <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-35</a>. In the original this is put absolutely "And as to the priests' due from the people, when," etc., but our language requires some insertion to make it read more smoothly. "And as to the due of the priests from the people, the manner of its exaction was as follows: When," etc. But besides the due and legal portion, which, nevertheless, they took in an illegal way, they demanded a part of the flesh reserved for the feast of the offerer, and to which they had absolutely no right (see <a href="/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>). The legal due of the priest was the right shoulder and the wave breast; but before he took them they were to be consecrated to God by the burning of the fat upon the altar (<a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31, 34</a>). It is worth observing that the people seem well acquainted with the words of the Law, and are indignant because the priests, its proper guardians, do not abide literally by them. This contempt of the Law distressed their religious susceptibilites, while the cupidity of Eli's sons offended their moral nature. And so <span class="cmt_word">men abhorred the offering of Jehovah.</span> Lit. it is the <span class="accented">minchah</span>, the unbloody sacrifice, or meat offering, but it is put here forevery kind of sacrificial offering. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are the rich and well to do; these would become so poor as to be obliged to hire themselves out for bread. &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, to cease to be what they were before. The use of &#1506;&#1491; as a conjunction, in the sense of "yea" or "in fact," may be explained as an elliptical expression, signifying "it comes to this, that." "Seven children" are mentioned as the full number of the divine blessing in children (see <a href="/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>). "The mother of many children" pines away, because she has lost all her sons, and with them her support in her old age (see <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>). This comes from the Lord, who kills, etc. (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). The words of <a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm">1 Samuel 2:6</a> are figurative. God hurls down into death and the danger of death, and also rescues therefrom (see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3-4</a>). The first three clauses of <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a> are repeated verbatim in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7-8</a>. Dust and the dunghill are figures used to denote the deepest degradation and ignominy. The antithesis to this is, sitting upon the chair or throne of glory, the seat occupied by noble princes. The Lord does all this, for He is the creator and upholder of the world.

Now as Jehovah, the God of Israel, the Holy One, governs the world with His almighty power, the righteous have nothing to fear. With this thought the last strophe of the song begins:</body></html>
