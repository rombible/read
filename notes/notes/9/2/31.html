As Eli had preferred the exaltation of his sons to God's honour, he is condemned to see the strength of his house broken. Nay, more; there is not to be an "old man in his house." The young men full of energy and vigour perish by the sword; the Survivors fade away by disease. The Jews say that the house of Ithamar was peculiarly short-lived, but the prophecy was amply fulfilled in the slaughter of Eli's house, first at Shiloh, and then at Nob by Doeg the Edomite at the command of Saul. There is nothing to warrant an abiding curse upon his family. The third or fourth generation is the limit of the visitation of the sins of the fathers upon the children. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"If man sins against man, God judges him; but if a man sins against Jehovah, who can interpose with entreaty for him?" In the use of &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493; and &#1497;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1500;&#1493; there is a paranomasia which cannot be reproduced in our language. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; signifies to decide or pass sentence (<a href="/genesis/48-11.htm">Genesis 48:11</a>), then to arbitrate, to settle a dispute as arbitrator (<a href="/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-30.htm">Psalm 106:30</a>), and in the Hithpael to act as mediator, hence to entreat. And these meanings are applicable here. In the case of one man's sin against another, God settles the dispute as arbitrator through the proper authorities; whereas, when a man sins against God, no one can interpose as arbitrator. Such a sin cannot be disposed of by intercession. But Eli's sons did not listen to this admonition, which was designed to reform daring sinners with mild words and representation; "for," adds the historian, "Jehovah was resolved to slay them." The father's reproof made no impression upon them, because they were already given up to the judgment of hardening. (On hardening as a divine sentence, see the discussions at <a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>.) </body></html>
