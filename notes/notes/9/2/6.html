The reign of a Divine law administered by the God to whom Hannah prayed is universal, and guides with a strict unerring justice what are commonly called the ups and downs, the changes and chances, of this mortal life. The following lines of the 7th, 8th, and 9th verses enforce by varied instances the same solemn truth.<p>The Babylonian Talmud on these words has a curious and interesting tradition:—“Three classes appear on the day of judgment: the perfectly righteous, who are at once written and sealed for eternal life; the thoroughly bad, who are at once written and sealed for hell: as it is written (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>), ‘And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt;’ and those in the intermediate state, who go down into hell, where they cry and howl for a time, whence they ascend again: as it is written (<a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm" title="And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.">Zechariah 13:9</a>), ‘And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried; they shall call on my name, and I will hear them.’ It is of them Hannah said (<a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm" title="The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.">1Samuel 2:6</a>), ‘The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to hell, and bringeth up.’”—Treatise <span class= "ital">Bosh Hashanah, </span>fol. 16, Colossians 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/2-6.htm" title="The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up....">1 Samuel 2:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord killeth and maketh alive </span>— The power of life and death is in the hands of God; whom he pleaseth he takes out of the world, and whom he pleaseth, he preserves in it; raising men even from the brink of the grave, when they are ready to drop into it. <span class="ital">The Lord maketh poor,</span> &c. — Here she acknowledges the power of God, in frequently changing the conditions of men, reducing the rich to extreme poverty, and exalting the poor to great riches.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Hannah's heart rejoiced, not in Samuel, but in the Lord. She looks beyond the gift, and praises the Giver. She rejoiced in the salvation of the Lord, and in expectation of His coming, who is the whole salvation of his people. The strong are soon weakened, and the weak are soon strengthened, when God pleases. Are we poor? God made us poor, which is a good reason why we should be content, and make up our minds to our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a good reason why we should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully, and do good with the abundance he gives us. He respects not man's wisdom or fancied excellences, but chooses those whom the world accounts foolish, teaching them to feel their guilt, and to value his free and precious salvation. This prophecy looks to the kingdom of Christ, that kingdom of grace, of which Hannah speaks, after having spoken largely of the kingdom of providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name MESSIAH, or his Anointed. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will be safe, and the enemies of it will be ruined; for the Anointed, the Lord Christ, is able to save, and to destroy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See an instance in <a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>.

Which is true of different persons; some he takes away by death, and others he preserves and continues in life; and of the same persons, whom God removes by death, and restores them to life again, of which there are instances both in the Old and New Testament; and be they which they will, both are of God, he is the great Disposer of life and death. Death is of him; it is by his appointment; it is sent by his order; and when it has a commission from him, there is no resisting it; and let it be brought about by what means it will, still it is of God: and life is of him; it is first given by him, and it is preserved by him; and though taken away, it shall be restored at the resurrection of the dead; of which some interpret this clause, as Kimchi and Ben Gersom observe: and what is here said is true, in a spiritual sense; the Lord kills by the law, or shows men that they are dead in sin, and in a legal sense; and he makes alive by his Spirit, through the Gospel, quickening such who were dead in trespasses and sins; which is his own work, and the effect of divine power and grace; See Gill on <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>. <p>he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up; he bringeth some very near to the grave, to the very brink of it; so that in their own apprehensions, and in the opinion of their friends, they are just dropping into it, and no hope of recovery left; when he says to them "Return", and brings them back from the pit, and delivers them from going into it, <a href="/job/33-22.htm">Job 33:22</a> and even when they are laid in it, he brings up out of it again, as in the case of Lazarus, and which will be the case in the resurrection, <a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">the grave</span>] The Heb. word <span class="ital">Sheol</span>, variously rendered in the E.

T. equivalent <span class="ital">Hades</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no direct allusion here to the resurrection: death and Sheol are figuratively used for the depths of adversity and peril: life for deliverance and prosperity.

In Jehovah’s hand are the issues of life and death, prosperity and adversity. All history illustrates this truth. Hezekiah is recalled from the gates of the grave: Job is tried by affliction: David is taken from the sheepfolds to be king: Nebuchadnezzar sinks to the level of a beast: Haman is degraded, Mordecai honoured: and chiefest example of all, He who “was despised and rejected of men,” was “highly exalted, and given a name that is above every name.”<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the boy was presented, his mother made herself known to the high priest as the woman who had previously prayed to the Lord at that place (see <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>.), and said, "For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath granted me my request which I asked of Him: therefore I also make him one asked of the Lord all the days that he liveth; he is asked of the Lord." &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497;: I also; et ego vicissim (Cler.). &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, to let a person ask, to grant his request, to give him what he asks (<a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>), signifies here to make a person "asked" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;). The meaning to lend, which the lexicons give to the word both here and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>, has no other support than the false rendering of the lxx, and is altogether unsuitable both in the one and the other. Jehovah had not lent the son to Hannah, but had given him (see <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>); still less could a man lend his son to the Lord. The last clause of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>, "and he worshipped the Lord there," refers to Elkanah, qui in votum Hannae consenserat, and not to Samuel. On a superficial glance, the plural &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;, which is found in some Codd., and in the Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, appears the more suitable; but when we look more closely at the connection in which the clause stands, we see at once that it does not wind up the foregoing account, but simply introduces the closing act of the transference of Samuel. Consequently the singular is perfectly appropriate; and notwithstanding the fact that the subject is not mentioned, the allusion to Samuel is placed beyond all doubt. When Hannah had given up her son to the high priest, his father Elkanah first of all worshipped before the Lord in the sanctuary, and then Hannah worshipped in the song of praise, which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>. </body></html>
