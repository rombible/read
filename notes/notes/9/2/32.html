Let Eli's example excite parents earnestly to strive against the beginnings of wickedness, and to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. In the midst of the sentence against the house of Eli, mercy is promised to Israel. God's work shall never fall to the ground for want of hands to carry it on. Christ is that merciful and faithful High Priest, whom God raised up when the Levitical priesthood was thrown off, who in all things did his Father's mind, and for whom God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that hell cannot prevail against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The original text is rather obscure and difficult of construction, but the King James Version probably gives the sense of it.

But the marginal reading, "thou shalt see the affliction of the tabernacle," seems to be a preferable translation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So the sense is, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou shalt see, </span> not in thy person, but in thy posterity, (it being most frequent in Scripture to attribute that to parents which properly belongs to their posterity only; as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm" title="And I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.">Genesis 17:8</a> <a href="/genesis/27-29.htm" title="Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons bow down to you: cursed be every one that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you.">Genesis 27:29</a>,40</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">an enemy, </span> i.e. thy competitor, or him who shall possess that place of high trust and honour which now thou enjoyest, (such persons being through man’s corrupt nature esteemed as a man’s worst enemy,) in my habitation, i.e. in the sanctuary. And then he adds by way of aggravation, that this sad accident should happen in all the wealth when God shall give Israel, i.e. in a time when God should eminently bless Israel, and make good all his promises to them, which was in Solomon’s days, when Abiathar of Eli’s race was put out of the high priesthood, and Zadok was put in his place, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm" title="So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.">1 Kings 2:27</a>,35</span>, when the priesthood was most glorious, and most profitable, and comfortable, and therefore the loss of it more deplorable. But the words may be otherwise rendered, as is noted in the margin of our English Bibles: <span class="ital">Thou shalt see</span>, to wit, in thy own person, the <span class="ital">affliction</span>, or <span class="ital">oppression</span>, or calamity of my <span class="ital">habitation</span>, i.e. either of the land of Israel, wherein I dwell; or of the sanctuary, called the <span class="ital">habitation</span> by way of eminency, whose greatest glory the ark was, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm" title="And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.">1 Samuel 4:21</a>,22</span>, and consequently, whose greatest calamity the loss of the ark was; <span class="ital">for</span>, or <span class="ital">instead of all that good wherewith God would have blessed Israel</span>, or was about to bless Israel; having raised up a young prophet, Samuel, and thereby given good grounds of hope that he intended to bless Israel, if thou and thy sons had not hindered it by your sins, which God was resolved severely to punish. So this clause of the threatening concerns Eli’s person, as the following concerns his posterity.

Either the Philistines in the land of Israel, where God chose to dwell, who quickly after made war against Israel, and pitched in Aphek, <a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a> or, as in the margin of our Bibles, and other versions (i), "thou shalt see the affliction of the tabernacle"; as he did when the ark of God was taken, at the news of which he died, <a href="/1_samuel/4-17.htm">1 Samuel 4:17</a> and so the Targum understands it of affliction and calamity, yet not of the house of God, but of his own house; paraphrasing the words thus,"and thou shall see the calamity that shall come upon the men of thine house, for the sins which they have committed before me in the house of my sanctuary:''but it seems best to interpret it of a rival, which not he in his own person should see, but whom his posterity should see high priest in the temple; as they did in Solomon's time, when Abiathar, of the family of Eli, was thrust out, and Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, was put in; for, as Kimchi observes, when a man has two wives, they are rivals or adversaries to one another, jealous and emulous of each other, as Elkanah's two wives were, and of one of them the same word is used as here, <a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a> so when one high priest was put out, and another taken in, the one was the rival or adversary of the other, as in the case referred to: <p>in all the wealth which God shall give Israel; which points exactly at the time when this should be, even men God did well to Israel, gave them great prosperity, wealth and riches, quietness and safety, a famous temple built for the worship of God, and everything in a flourishing condition, both with respect to temporals and spirituals, as was in the days of Solomon, see <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a> and then it was amidst all that plenty and prosperity, and when the high priesthood was most honourable and profitable, that Eli's family was turned out of it, and another put into it: <p>and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever; See Gill on <a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31</a> this is repeated for confirmation, and with this addition, that this would be the case for ever. <p>(i)   Symmachus; "angustiam tabernaculi", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

The best explanation of this difficult passage appears to be this: ‘Thou, in the person of thy descendants, wilt see another take thy place as priest in my habitation (cp. <span class="ital"><a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm" title="Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?">1 Samuel 2:29</a></span>), at the time when the nation shall be most prosperous and the office most honourable;’ the reference being to Abiathar’s deposition by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm" title="So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.">1 Kings 2:27</a>). The words might also be translated “<span class="ital">Thou shalt behold the distress of my habitation</span>” (cp. E. V. margin), and would then refer to the neglect which the tabernacle suffered owing to the loss of the Ark, even while the nation was prospering under Samuel and Saul. Such neglect would be a punishment on the house of Eli, because the High-priest for the time would lose his position and influence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Sept. however omits <span class="ital"><a href="/1_samuel/2-32.htm" title="And you shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever.">1 Samuel 2:32</a></span>, and there are other grounds for suspecting that the present Heb. text of this verse as well as of <span class="ital"><a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm" title="Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?">1 Samuel 2:29</a></span> is corrupt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wealth</span>] Here in the sense of “weal,” “well-being,” as in the Litany ‘In all time of our <span class="ital">wealth</span>.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt see an enemy.</span> The translation of ver. 32 is very difficult, but is probably as follows: "And thou shalt behold, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> see with wonder and astonishment, narrowness of habitation in all the wealth which shall be given unto Israel." The word translated <span class="accented">narrowness</span> often means an "enemy," but as that for <span class="accented">habitation</span> is the most general term in the Hebrews language for a dwelling, being used even of the dens of wild beasts (<a href="/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>; <a href="/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>), the rendering an "enemy of dwelling" gives no sense. Hence the violent insertion of the pronoun <span class="accented">my</span>, for which no valid excuse can be given. But <span class="accented">narrowness of dwelling</span>, means distress, especially in a man's domestic relations, and this is the sense required. In the growing public and national prosperity which was to be Israel's lot under Samuel, Saul, David, and Solomon, Eli was to see, not in person, but prophetically, calamity attaching itself to his own family. His house was to decay in the midst of the progress of all the rest. Upon this denunciation of private distress naturally follows the repetition of the threat that the house of Ithamar should be left without an old man to guide its course onward to renewed prosperity. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The youthful Samuel, on the other hand, continued to grow in stature, and in favour with God and man (see <a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>). </body></html>
