She looks beyond the gift, and praises the Giver. She rejoiced in the salvation of the Lord, and in expectation of His coming, who is the whole salvation of his people. The strong are soon weakened, and the weak are soon strengthened, when God pleases. Are we poor? God made us poor, which is a good reason why we should be content, and make up our minds to our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a good reason why we should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully, and do good with the abundance he gives us. He respects not man's wisdom or fancied excellences, but chooses those whom the world accounts foolish, teaching them to feel their guilt, and to value his free and precious salvation. This prophecy looks to the kingdom of Christ, that kingdom of grace, of which Hannah speaks, after having spoken largely of the kingdom of providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name MESSIAH, or his Anointed. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will be safe, and the enemies of it will be ruined; for the Anointed, the Lord Christ, is able to save, and to destroy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See an instance in <a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>.

This is but a further illustration of what is before expressed. Literally; such poor as are beggars, are those that are extremely poor, that sit in the dust and beg, and have nothing but a dunghill to lie on; yet God is able to raise and lift up persons in such an extremely low condition to a very high one: spiritually; such are the poor, who are poor in spirit, and spiritually poor, and are sensible of it, and they, and they only, are beggars. For all that are poor, as they are not sensible of their poverty, so they beg not; but some are and beg; they knock at the door of grace and mercy; their language is petitionary, they entreat the grace and mercy of God; their posture is standing, and waiting till they have an answer; they are importunate, and will not easily take a denial; and they observe all opportunities to get relief, and are thankful for everything that is given then. Their conditions, in which they are, is represented by the "dust" and "dunghill"; which in general denotes that they are in a mean estate, in a sinful one, and in a very polluted and loathsome one; in this condition the Lord finds them, when he calls them by his grace; and from this he raises and lifts them up by his Spirit and grace, out of which they could never have raised themselves; and in which estate of sin and misery they must have lain, had he not exerted his powerful efficacious grace, in bringing them into a glorious one, next described: <p>to set them among princes the people of God called by grace, who are the sons of the King of kings by adoption, manifested in their regeneration and faith; have a princely spirit, the spirit of adoption, a free, generous, and bountiful one; live and look like princes, are well fed and clothed, and attended; have the riches of princes, and are heirs of a kingdom: and to be set among them, is to be made one, and ranked as such; to have a place and a name in the church, and among the people of God; to sit down with them at the table of the Lord, and have communion with them: and to make them inherit the throne of glory; eternal glory and happiness, which as it is signified by a kingdom and crown, so by a throne, and is the same with Christ's, <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a> and therefore must be a glorious one: and this is had by way of inheritance; not obtained by industry, nor purchased with money; but comes by adoption grace, and belongs only to children, is a bequest of our heavenly Father, and comes through the death of Christ the testator; and this phrase denotes not barely the right unto, but the possession of his happiness and glory: <p>for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them; the earth has its foundations on which it is laid, and its pillars by which it is supported; but these are no other than the power and providence of God; otherwise the earth is hung upon nothing, in the open circumambient air: and that God can and does do this may well be thought, and to do all the above things in providence and grace, related in the preceding verses; in the support, and for the proof of which, this is observed. Figuratively, the pillars of the earth may design the princes of the world, the supreme rulers of it, and civil magistrates, who are sometimes called cornerstones, and the shields of the earth, <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/10-4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>, and so pillars, because they are the means of cementing, supporting, and protecting the people of the earth, and of preserving their peace and property. Likewise good men may be meant in a figurative sense, who, as they are the salt of the earth, are the pillars of it, for whose sake it was made, and is supported, and continued in being; the church is the pillar and ground of truth; and every good man is a pillar in the house of God, and especially ministers of the Gospel; see <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, <i>and</i> lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set <i>them</i> among <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth <i>are</i> the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.</span><p>(f) He prefers to honour, and does according to his own will, though man's judgment is contrary.<p>(g) Therefore he may dispose all things according to his will.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">out of the dust</span>] “To sit in the dust” (<a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm" title="Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.">Isaiah 47:1</a>), or “on the dunghill” (<a href="/lamentations/4-5.htm" title="They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.">Lamentations 4:5</a>) are Oriental figures for a condition of extreme degradation and misery, derived probably from the practice of mourners (<a href="/job/2-8.htm" title="And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes.">Job 2:8</a>): to share the company of princes, and occupy a throne of honour (<a href="/job/36-7.htm" title="He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he does establish them for ever, and they are exalted.">Job 36:7</a>) are metaphors for advancement and prosperity. <a href="/context/psalms/113-7.htm" title="He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the dunghill;...">Psalm 113:7-9</a> is copied almost verbatim from these verses.

Cp. <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm" title="The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.">Psalm 75:3</a>. The expression “pillars of the earth” (cp. <a href="/job/9-6.htm" title="Which shakes the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.">Job 9:6</a>) is a poetical metaphor derived from the construction of a house (see <a href="/judges/16-26.htm" title="And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house stands, that I may lean on them.">Jdg 16:26</a>), and need not imply any theory as to the earth’s shape.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  2  None is holy as the Lord; for there is none beside Thee;<p>And no rock is as our God.<p>  3  Speak ye not much lofty, lofty;<p>Let (not) insolence go out of thy mouth!<p>For the Lord is an omniscient God,<p>And with Him deeds are weighed.<p>God manifests himself as holy in the government of the kingdom of His grace by His guidance of the righteous to salvation (see at <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). But holiness is simply the moral reflection of the glory of the one absolute God. This explains the reason given for His holiness, viz., "there is not one (a God) beside thee" (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/22-32.htm">2 Samuel 22:32</a>). As the holy and only One, God is the rock (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-3.htm">Psalm 18:3</a>) in which the righteous can always trust. The wicked therefore should tremble before His holiness, and not talk in their pride of the lofty things which they have accomplished or intend to perform. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1492; is defined more precisely in the following clause, which is also dependent upon &#1488;&#1500; by the word &#1506;&#1514;&#1511;, as insolent words spoken by the wicked against the righteous (see <a href="/psalms/31-19.htm">Psalm 31:19</a>). For Jehovah hears such words; He is "a God of knowledge" (Deus scientiarum), a God who sees and knows every single thing. The plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; has an intensive signification. &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1504;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; might be rendered "deeds are not weighed, or equal" (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25-26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17</a>). But this would only apply to the actions of men; for the acts of God are always just, or weighed. But an assertion respecting the actions of men does not suit the context. Hence this clause is reckoned in the Masora as one of the passages in which &#1500;&#1488; stands for &#1500;&#1493; (see at <a href="/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>). "To Him (with Him) deeds are weighed:" that is to say, the acts of God are weighed, i.e., equal or just. This is the real meaning according to the passages in Ezekiel, and not "the actions of men are weighed by Him" (De Wette, Maurer, Ewald, etc.): for God weighs the minds and hearts of men (<a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>), not their actions. This expression never occurs. The weighed or righteous acts of God are described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-4.htm">1 Samuel 2:4-8</a> in great and general traits, as displayed in the government of His kingdom through the marvellous changes which occur in the circumstances connected with the lives of the righteous and the wicked.</body></html>
