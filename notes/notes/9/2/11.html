Elkanah went home, and the old family life, with its calm religious trustfulness, flowed on in the quiet town of “Ramah of the Watchers” as it did aforetime; the only disturbing sorrowful element was removed in answer to the mother’s prayers, and little children grew up (<a href="/1_samuel/2-21.htm" title="And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters.

As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word "minister" is used in three senses in Scripture:<p>(1) of the service or ministration of both priests and Levites rendered unto the Lord <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>, <a href="/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a> :<p>(2) of the ministrations of the Levites as rendered to the priests, to aid them in divine Service <a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6</a> :<p>(3) of any service or ministration, especially one rendered to a man of God, as that of Joshua to Moses <a href="/numbers/11-28.htm">Numbers 11:28</a>.<p>The application of it to Samuel as ministering to the Lord before Eli the priest accords "most exactly" with Samuel's condition as a Levite. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest&#8212;He must have been engaged in some occupation suited to his tender age, as in playing upon the cymbals, or other instruments of music; in lighting the lamps, or similar easy and interesting services.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In some way agreeable to his tender years, as in singing, or playing upon instruments of music, as they used then to do in God’s service; or lighting the lamps, or some other way.

This was after he had offered the sacrifices at the feast, worshipped the Lord, and Hannah had delivered her prayer or song of praise, and both had committed Samuel to the care of Eli, and left him with him: <p>and the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest; he not only read in the book of the law, but learned to sing the praises of God vocally, and to play upon an instrument of music used in the service of God in those times, and to light the lamps in the tabernacle, and open and shut the doors of it, and the like; which were suitable to his age, and which might not be quite so tender as some have thought; or this may respect some small beginnings in the ministry of the sanctuary, in which he gradually increased under the inspection, guidance, and instruction of Eli, which is meant by ministering before him; the Targum is,"in the life of Eli the priest;''he began his ministration before his death. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.

At first Samuel would be but a scholar, for, as we have mentioned on 1 Samuel 1:21, there were, no doubt, regulations for the training of children devoted to the service of the sanctuary. The peculiarity about Samuel was that he was devoted for life, for possibly it was a not uncommon practice for young persons to receive some training at Shiloh; just as we find that Samuel himself subsequently gathered youths round him at Naioth in Ramah for educational purposes. Learning practically was confined to the priesthood, and we can scarcely imagine that the knowledge which Phinehas and the family of Aaron brought with them out of Egypt would be allowed to perish. Samuel certainly had himself received careful instruction (see on 1 Samuel 10:25), and this could scarcely have happened if the training of young persons had not been part of the priests' duties at Shiloh. This then explains why Samuel was brought to Eli at so tender an age, and why the charge of so young a child was undertaken without a murmur. Before Eli means under his general superintendence. Everything done at Shiloh was done <span class="accented">before Eli</span>, as being the chief ruler there. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are the rich and well to do; these would become so poor as to be obliged to hire themselves out for bread. &#1495;&#1491;&#1500;, to cease to be what they were before. The use of &#1506;&#1491; as a conjunction, in the sense of "yea" or "in fact," may be explained as an elliptical expression, signifying "it comes to this, that." "Seven children" are mentioned as the full number of the divine blessing in children (see <a href="/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>). "The mother of many children" pines away, because she has lost all her sons, and with them her support in her old age (see <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>). This comes from the Lord, who kills, etc. (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). The words of <a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm">1 Samuel 2:6</a> are figurative. God hurls down into death and the danger of death, and also rescues therefrom (see <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">Psalm 30:3-4</a>). The first three clauses of <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a> are repeated verbatim in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7-8</a>. Dust and the dunghill are figures used to denote the deepest degradation and ignominy. The antithesis to this is, sitting upon the chair or throne of glory, the seat occupied by noble princes. The Lord does all this, for He is the creator and upholder of the world. The pillars (&#1502;&#1510;&#1511;&#1497;, from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;  equals  &#1497;&#1510;&#1511;) of the earth are the Lord's; i.e., they were created or set up by Him, and by Him they are sustained. Now as Jehovah, the God of Israel, the Holy One, governs the world with His almighty power, the righteous have nothing to fear. With this thought the last strophe of the song begins:</body></html>
