The image, doubtless, is a memory of the long desert wandering. The steep precipices and the strange fantastic rocks of Sinai, standing up in the midst of the shifting desert sands, supplied an ever present picture of unchangeableness, of majesty, and of security. The term rock, as applied to God, is first found in the Song of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm" title="Of the Rock that begat you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-30.htm" title="How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?">Deuteronomy 32:30-31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-37.htm" title="And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>), where the juxtaposition of rock and salvation in <a href="/1_samuel/2-15.htm" title="Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.">1Samuel 2:15</a>—<span class= "ital">he lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation</span>—seems to indicate that Hannah was acquainted with this song or national hymn of Moses.

She looks beyond the gift, and praises the Giver. She rejoiced in the salvation of the Lord, and in expectation of His coming, who is the whole salvation of his people. The strong are soon weakened, and the weak are soon strengthened, when God pleases. Are we poor? God made us poor, which is a good reason why we should be content, and make up our minds to our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a good reason why we should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully, and do good with the abundance he gives us. He respects not man's wisdom or fancied excellences, but chooses those whom the world accounts foolish, teaching them to feel their guilt, and to value his free and precious salvation. This prophecy looks to the kingdom of Christ, that kingdom of grace, of which Hannah speaks, after having spoken largely of the kingdom of providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name MESSIAH, or his Anointed. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will be safe, and the enemies of it will be ruined; for the Anointed, the Lord Christ, is able to save, and to destroy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Any rock ... - The term rock as applied to God is first found in the song of Moses (see <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> note), where the juxtaposition of rock and salvation in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15</a>, "he lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation," seems to indicate that Hannah was acquainted with the song of Moses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>1Sa 2:1-11.

From the consideration of what the Lord had done for her, which had filled her heart and mouth with joy and praise, she is led to celebrate the perfections of God, and begins with his holiness, in which he is glorious, and which appears in all his ways and works; he is essentially, originally, independently, perfectly, and immutably holy, as others are not. Angels are holy, but not of themselves; their holiness is from the Lord; nor is it perfect in comparison of his, and therefore they cover their faces while they celebrate that perfection of his; nor immutable, at least not naturally so, as the loss of it in those that fell demonstrates. Of men, some under the legal dispensation were holy, not truly, but in a typical and ceremonial sense; some are only outwardly and hypocritically holy, and only so in the sight of men, not in the sight of God; and those that are truly holy, being called to holiness, and have the principle of it implanted in them, and live holy lives and conversations; yet though there is a likeness of the holiness of God in them, being made partakers of the divine nature; it is far from an equality to it; for the holiness of the best of men is imperfect; they are not without sin in them, nor without sin committed by them, and perfection is disclaimed by them all; but the Lord is without iniquity, just and true is he; none in his nature, nor in any of his works, not the least shadow thereof: <p>for there is none besides thee; there is no God besides him; no being but what is of him, and none is holy but by him; the holiness of angels is from him; the holiness of Adam in innocence was of him; and all the holiness of his chosen ones comes from him, to which they are chosen by him, and which is secured in that choice unto them, and are sanctified by God the Father, in Christ, and through the Spirit: <p>neither is there any rock like our God; the word rock is used for Deity, and sometimes for a false one, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-31.htm">Deuteronomy 32:31</a> and so it may here, and the sense be, there is no god like to our God; there is indeed none besides him; there are fictitious gods, and nominal ones, as the idols of the Gentiles, and who are so in an improper and figurative sense, as magistrates; but there is but one true and living God; nor is there any like him for the perfections of his nature, and the blessings of his goodness, whether in providence or grace. Under this metaphor of a rock, our Lord Jesus Christ is often signified; he is the rock of Israel, the rock of refuge, and of salvation; and there is no rock can do what he does, hide and shelter from the justice of God; there is no rock like him for strength and duration; none like him for a foundation to build upon, or for safety and protection from the wrath of God, and the rage of men, see <a href="/psalms/18-31.htm">Psalm 18:31</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">rock</span>] A frequent metaphor to describe the strength, faithfulness, and unchangeableness of Jehovah.

The striking circumstance that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a>, Samuel's parents brought three oxen with them to Shiloh, and yet in <a href="/1_samuel/1-25.htm">1 Samuel 1:25</a> the ox (&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;) alone is spoken of as being slain (or sacrificed), may be explained very simply on the supposition that in <a href="/1_samuel/1-25.htm">1 Samuel 1:25</a> that particular sacrifice is referred to, which was associated with the presentation of the boy, that is to say, the burnt-offering by virtue of which the boy was consecrated to the Lord as a spiritual sacrifice for a lifelong service at His sanctuary, whereas the other two oxen served as the yearly festal offering, i.e., the burnt-offerings and thank-offerings which Elkanah presented year by year, and the presentation of which the writer did not think it needful to mention, simply because it followed partly from <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a> and partly from the Mosaic law.<p>(Note: The interpretation of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; (lxx), upon which Thenius would found an alteration of the text, is proved to be both arbitrary and wrong by the fact that the translators themselves afterwards mention the &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, which Elkanah brought year by year, and the &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and consequently represent him as offering at least two animals, in direct opposition to the &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;. This discrepancy cannot be removed by the assertion that in <a href="/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a> the sacrificial animal intended for the dedication of the boy is the only one mentioned; and the presentation of the regular festal sacrifice is taken for granted, for an ephah of meal would not be the proper quantity to be offered in connection with a single ox, since, according to the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8-9</a>, only three-tenths of an ephah of meal were required when an ox was presented as a burnt-offering or slain offering. The presentation of an ephah of meal presupposes the offering of three oxen, and therefore shows that in <a href="/1_samuel/1-24.htm">1 Samuel 1:24</a> the materials are mentioned for all the sacrifices that Elkanah was about to offer.) </body></html>
