She looks beyond the gift, and praises the Giver. She rejoiced in the salvation of the Lord, and in expectation of His coming, who is the whole salvation of his people. The strong are soon weakened, and the weak are soon strengthened, when God pleases. Are we poor? God made us poor, which is a good reason why we should be content, and make up our minds to our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a good reason why we should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully, and do good with the abundance he gives us. He respects not man's wisdom or fancied excellences, but chooses those whom the world accounts foolish, teaching them to feel their guilt, and to value his free and precious salvation. This prophecy looks to the kingdom of Christ, that kingdom of grace, of which Hannah speaks, after having spoken largely of the kingdom of providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name MESSIAH, or his Anointed. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will be safe, and the enemies of it will be ruined; for the Anointed, the Lord Christ, is able to save, and to destroy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Any rock ... - The term rock as applied to God is first found in the song of Moses (see <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> note), where the juxtaposition of rock and salvation in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15</a>, "he lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation," seems to indicate that Hannah was acquainted with the song of Moses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>1Sa 2:1-11.

Hannah, from relating gracious experiences, and celebrating, the divine perfections of holiness, omniscience, and sovereignty, passes on to take notice of the dealings of God with men in providence and grace; bows are here put for all military arms, which men of might and war make use of, and which God can easily break in pieces, and so make war to cease in the earth, and hinder warlike men from doing what they design and attempt; they are enfeebled and weakened by him, and their hands cannot perform their enterprises: so the bows of Satan, and his principalities and powers, are broken, and his fiery darts are quenched, and the people of the Lord enabled to stand against him, and wrestle with him and them, being strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, as it follows: <p>and they that stumbled are girt with strength; who, through weakness, are ready to stumble at everything they meet with in the way; yet, being girded with strength by the Lord, are able to do great exploits, as David did, that being his case, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>, so such as are weak in grace, in faith, in knowledge, and ready to stumble at every trial and exercise, let it come from what quarter it will; yet being girded by the Lord with strength, are able to exercise grace, perform duty, go through every service they are called to, whether in a way of doing or suffering, to bear the yoke and cross of Christ, to oppose every enemy, to walk on in the ways of God, and to persevere in faith and holiness to the end. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">The bows of the mighty men are broken</span>, &c.] The bow was one of the chief weapons of war (<a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm" title="From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.">2 Samuel 1:22</a>). Its being broken is a natural symbol of defeat. “To be girded with strength” (<a href="/psalms/18-39.htm" title="For you have girded me with strength to the battle: you have subdued under me those that rose up against me.">Psalm 18:39</a>) is a figure derived from the practice of “girding up the loins” in preparation for active exertion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4, 5</span>.

The meaning to lend, which the lexicons give to the word both here and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>, has no other support than the false rendering of the lxx, and is altogether unsuitable both in the one and the other. Jehovah had not lent the son to Hannah, but had given him (see <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>); still less could a man lend his son to the Lord. The last clause of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>, "and he worshipped the Lord there," refers to Elkanah, qui in votum Hannae consenserat, and not to Samuel. On a superficial glance, the plural &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1493;&#1468;, which is found in some Codd., and in the Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic, appears the more suitable; but when we look more closely at the connection in which the clause stands, we see at once that it does not wind up the foregoing account, but simply introduces the closing act of the transference of Samuel. Consequently the singular is perfectly appropriate; and notwithstanding the fact that the subject is not mentioned, the allusion to Samuel is placed beyond all doubt. When Hannah had given up her son to the high priest, his father Elkanah first of all worshipped before the Lord in the sanctuary, and then Hannah worshipped in the song of praise, which follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>. </body></html>
