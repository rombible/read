Let Eli's example excite parents earnestly to strive against the beginnings of wickedness, and to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. In the midst of the sentence against the house of Eli, mercy is promised to Israel. God's work shall never fall to the ground for want of hands to carry it on. Christ is that merciful and faithful High Priest, whom God raised up when the Levitical priesthood was thrown off, who in all things did his Father's mind, and for whom God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that hell cannot prevail against it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>An ephod - The High Priest's ephod, in which was Urim and Thummim.<p>Did I give ... - The bountiful provision made by God for His priests is mentioned as the great aggravation of the covetousness of Eli's sons (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 2:27-35.

The prediction of this prophet was fully confirmed by the afflictions, degradation, poverty, and many untimely deaths with which the house of Eli was visited after its announcement (see 1Sa 4:11; 14:3; 22:18-23; 1Ki 2:27).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Did I choose him, </span> to wit, Aaron thy father? whereby he shows what he meant by his <span class="ital">father’s house</span>.

The aged Eli reproved his sons with solemn warnings on account of their sins; but without his warnings being listened to. From the reproof itself we learn, that beside the sin noticed in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>, they also committed the crime of lying with the women who served at the tabernacle (see at <a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>), and thus profaned the sanctuary with whoredom. But Eli, with the infirmities of his old age, did nothing further to prevent these abominations than to say to his sons, "Why do ye according to the sayings which I hear, sayings about you which are evil, of this whole people." &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; is inserted to make the meaning clearer, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; is dependent upon &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;. "This whole people" signifies all the people that came to Shiloh, and heard and saw the wicked doings there. </body></html>
