This being the case, so much contempt cast upon his sacrifices, and dishonour on himself: <p>I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever; or minister in the priest's office before him: if the house of Aaron in general is meant, it did continue so to do, in one branch or another of it, as long as the Mosaic dispensation lasted, which is meant by the phrase "for ever"; but since it is afterwards denied that it should, rather the house of Ithamar, or of the immediate parent of Eli, is meant, and this said when the priesthood was translated from the family of Eleazar to the family of Ithamar; when, and on what account that was done, we nowhere read. It is a tradition (f), that it was in the time of the Levite's concubine; and because Phinehas, and the other priests, did not go from city to city, and reprove the Israelites for the many sins they were fallen into, that the priesthood was taken away out of the family of Eleazar, and translated to that of Ithamar: <p>but now the Lord saith, be it far from me; to continue the priesthood in the line of Ithamar; which argues no change in the purposes or promises of God, this being not a decree of his, but a declaration of his will; that if the house of Ithamar behaved well in the discharge of the office of the high priest, it should continue with them to the end of the Mosaic dispensation, but if not, it should be taken from them, and restored to the family of Eleazar; as it was in Solomon's time: <p>for them that honour me I will honour; as Phinehas the son of Eleazar did at Shittim, where he showed his zeal for the Lord of hosts, and had the promise of the everlasting priesthood; and which continued in his family until the Babylonish captivity, excepting the interval in which it was in the family of Ithamar, and for what reason is not known: <p>and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed; as the posterity of Eli, whose sons despised the Lord, and his offerings, as appeared by their conduct; and these were killed in battle in one day, and in the times of Solomon, Abiathar, of the posterity of Eli, was thrust out of the priesthood, and Zadok, of the line of Eleazar, was put in his room, <a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27</a>. <p>(f) Midrash Samuel, apud Jarch. &amp; Kimch. in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed <i>that</i> thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span><p>(u) God's promises are only effective to those he gives faith to fear and obey him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">saith</span>] The Heb. word is one rarely used except of <span class="ital">a solemn divine utterance</span>, as in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>, and very commonly in the prophets.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I said indeed that thy house, and the house of the father, should walk before me for ever</span>] God had promised that the family of Aaron in all its branches should serve perpetually as priests in His presence (<a href="/exodus/29-9.htm" title="And you shall gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/25-13.htm" title="And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.">Numbers 25:13</a>): but now the decree must be reversed, for the faithlessness of Eli’s sons had broken the covenant.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said indeed.</span> By thus acting Eli became an accomplice in the irreligion of his sons, and God therefore revokes his grant of a perpetual priesthood. The promise had been made to Aaron's family as a whole (<a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>), and had then been renewed to the house of Eleazar (<a href="/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>). But the house of Ithamar was now in the ascendant, probably owing to Eli's own ability, who during the anarchical times of the Judges had won for himself, first, the civil power, and then, upon some fitting opportunity, the high priesthood also, though I suppose the heads of the houses of Eleazar and Ithamar were always persons of great importance, and high priests in a certain sense. Eli had now the priority, and had he and his family proved worthy, the possession of this high station might have been confirmed to them. Like Saul in the kingdom, they proved unworthy of it, and so they lost it forever. Their names, as we have seen above, do not even occur in the genealogies. <span class="cmt_word">I said .... but now Jehovah saith.</span> Can then a promise of God be withdrawn?  Yes, assuredly. Not from mankind as a whole, nor from the Church as a whole, but from each particular nation, or Church, or individual. To each separate person God's promises are conditional, and human action everywhere is a coworker with the Divine volition, though only within a limited sphere, and so as that the Divine purposes must finally be accomplished. Eli then and his sons may suffer forfeit of the promise by not fulfilling the obligations which, whether expressed or implied, are an essential condition of every promise made by God to man. But the high priesthood will continue, and will perform its allotted task of preparing for the priesthood of Christ. "Them that honour me I will honour," states one of these conditions essential on man's part to secure the fulfilment of God's promises. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;, "Not, my sons," i.e., do not such things, "for the report which I hear is not good; they make the people of Jehovah to transgress." &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is written without the pronoun &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; in an indefinite construction, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/1_samuel/6-3.htm">1 Samuel 6:3</a> (Maurer).

The assertion made by Thenius, that &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, without any further definition, cannot mean to cause to sin or transgress, is correct enough no doubt; but it does not prove that this meaning is inadmissible in the passage before us, since the further definition is actually to be found in the context. </body></html>
