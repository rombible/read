As he did this with a pious disposition of mind, it was called ministering unto the Lord. He received a blessing from the Lord. Those young people who serve God as well as they can, he will enable to improve, that they may serve him better. Eli shunned trouble and exertion. This led him to indulge his children, without using parental authority to restrain and correct them when young. He winked at the abuses in the service of the sanctuary till they became customs, and led to abominations; and his sons, who should have taught those that engaged in the service of the sanctuary what was good, solicited them to wickedness. Their offence was committed even in offering the sacrifices for sins, which typified the atonement of the Saviour! Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most dangerous, they tread under foot the blood of the covenant. Eli's reproof was far too mild and gentle. In general, none are more abandoned than the degenerate children of godly persons, when they break through restraints.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal references.

Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife&#8212;This blessing, like that which he had formerly pronounced, had a prophetic virtue; which, before long, appeared in the increase of Hannah's family (1Sa 2:21), and the growing qualifications of Samuel for the service of the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Visited, </span> to wit, in mercy, and with his blessing, as that word is used, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/21-1.htm" title="And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.">Genesis 21:1</a> <a href="/exodus/13-19.htm" title="And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and you shall carry up my bones away hence with you.">Exodus 13:19</a> <a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm" title="O LORD, you know: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in your long-suffering: know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.">Jeremiah 15:15</a></span>; not in anger, as it is taken <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/32-34.htm" title="Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.">Exodus 32:34</a> <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm" title="I also will do this to you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.">Leviticus 26:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Grew; </span> not only in age and stature, but especially in wisdom and goodness, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/luke/1-15.htm" title="For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.">Luke 1:15</a></span>.

Josephus (s) says, Elkanah had other sons by Hannah, and three daughters; which agrees not with the text: <p>and the child Samuel grew before the Lord: in age and stature, in grace and goodness, and improved much in the worship and service of God, both in the theory and practice of it; or became great with him, high in his esteem and favour, and was blessed with much of his presence, and with large gifts of his grace. <p>(s) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 10. sect. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters.

"Even before the fat was consumed," i.e., before the fat portions of the sacrifice had been placed in the altar-fire for the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3-5</a>), the priest's servant came and demanded flesh of the person sacrificing, to be roasted for the priest; "for he will not take boiled flesh of thee, but only &#1495;&#1497;, raw, i.e., fresh meat." And if the person sacrificing replied, "They will burn the fat directly (lit. 'at this time,' as in <a href="/genesis/25-31.htm">Genesis 25:31</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5</a>), then take for thyself, as thy soul desireth," he said, "No (&#1500;&#1493; for &#1500;&#1488;), but thou shalt give now; if not, I take by force." These abuses were practised by the priests in connection with the thank-offerings, with which a sacrificial meal was associated. Of these offerings, with which a sacrificial meal was associated. Of these offerings, the portion which legally fell to the priest as his share was the heave-leg and wave-breast. And this he was to receive after the fat portions of the sacrifice had been burned upon the altar (see <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-34</a>). To take the flesh of the sacrificial animal and roast it before this offering had been made, was a crime which was equivalent to a robbery of God, and is therefore referred to here with the emphatic particle &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, as being the worst crime that the sons of Eli committed. Moreover, the priests could not claim any of the flesh which the offerer of the sacrifice boiled for the sacrificial meal, after burning the fat portions upon the altar and giving up the portions which belonged to them, to say nothing of their taking it forcibly out of the pots while it was being boiled.</body></html>
