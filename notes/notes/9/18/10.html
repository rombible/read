Hitherto, when the dark hour came upon Saul the madness showed itself in the form of a dull torpor, a hopeless melancholia, an entire indifference to everything connected with life, as well in the lower as in the higher forms. This earlier phase of the <span class= "ital">soul’s malady </span>has been exquisitely pictured by Browning in his poem of “Saul.” Now the madness assumes a new phase, and the king is consumed with a murderous jealousy, that fills his whole soul, and drives him now to open deeds of ruffianly violence—now to devise dark plots against the life of the bated one. What a fall for the hero- king of Israel, the anointed of the Lord, whose reign had begun so brilliantly and successfully!<p><span class= "bld">And he prophesied.</span>—In his wild phrenzy—under the control of a power higher than himself, had he not by his breaking off all communion with God, left his soul defenceless and prepared for the presence of the evil spirit?—in his wild phrenzy we read “Saul prophesied.” The Dean of Canterbury well calls attention here to the conjugation employed in the original Hebrew of the word rendered “prophesied”—<span class= "ital">the Hith-pael, </span>which is never used by an Old Testament writer of real true prophecy, this being always expressed by the <span class= "ital">Niphal </span>conjugation. This of Saul’s was but a bastard imitation.<p>Saul was in a state of phrenzy, unable to master himself, speaking words of which he knew not the meaning, and acting like a man possessed. In all this there was something akin to the powerful emotions which agitated the true prophet: only it was not a holy influence, but one springing from violent) passions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/18-10.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand....">1 Samuel 18:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">On the morrow the evil spirit from God — </span>Which had formerly troubled him, producing melancholy, (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.">1 Samuel 16:14</a>,) was brought again upon him.

It is a sign that the Spirit of God is departed from men, if, like Saul, they are peevish, envious, suspicious, and ill-natured. Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, and Saul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observe the sweetness and usefulness of God's persecuted people, and the barbarity of their persecutors.

It is impossible to give the sense of "raving" to the word "prophesied," as though a merely natural state of frenzy were intended. The "prophesying" here was as directly the effect of the coming of the evil spirit upon Saul, as the "prophesying" in <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a> was the effect of the Spirit of God coming upon him. At the same time it is quite true that "madness" and "prophesyings" were considered as near akin (see <a href="/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 18:10-12.

(B). The narrative certainly gains by their omission, and describes the gradual growth of Saul’s enmity more naturally. At the same time there is no impossibility in supposing that the fit of passion to which Saul gave way on the day of the triumph brought on a return of his madness, in the frenzy of which he threatened David’s life: and yet that he afterwards retained him in his service and promoted him, yielding partly to the better impulses of his sane moments, partly to the force of popular opinion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It came to pass on the morrow</span>. The day had been a time of public triumph, and yet one of the chief actors goes home to a sleepless couch, because he thinks that another has received higher honour than himself. His melancholy deepens till a fit of insanity comes on. For <span class="cmt_word">the evil spirit from God came upon Saul.</span> Literally, " an evil spirit (breath) of God descended mightily upon Saul" (see <a href="/1_samuel/16-15.htm">1 Samuel 16:15</a>). Just as all mighty enthusiasms for good come from God, so do strong influences for evil, but in a different way. In all noble acts men are fellow workers with God; when evil carries them away it is of God, because he it is who has made and still maintains the laws of our moral nature; but it is by the working of general laws, and not by any special gift or grace bestowed by him. Saul had brooded over his disappointment, and cherished feelings of discontent at his own lot and of envy at the good of others to such an extent that his mind gave way before the diseased workings  of his imagination. And so he lost all control over himself, and <span class="cmt_word">prophesied</span>. The conjugation employed here (Hithpahel) is never used of real, true prophecy (which is always the Niphal), but of a bastard imitation of it. Really Saul was in a state of frenzy, unable to master himself, speaking words of which he knew not the meaning, and acting like a man possessed. In all this there was something akin to the powerful emotions which agitated the true prophet, only it was not a holy influence, but one springing from violent passions and a disturbed state of the mind. In order to soothe him <span class="cmt_word">David played with his hand, as at other times,</span> but without the desired effect. On the contrary, Saul brandished the javelin, which he carried as a sort of sceptre in his hand, with such violence that David twice had to escape from this threat of injury by flight. It is not certain that Saul actually threw the javelin. Had he done so it would be difficult to account for David escaping from it twice. After such an act of violence he would scarcely have trusted himself a second time in Saul's presence. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">Saul cast the javelin,</span> the Septuagint in the Alexandrian codex and the Chaldee render <span class="accented">lifted, i.e.</span> retaining the same consonants, they put vowels which refer the verb to another root. But even with the present vowels it may mean "made as though he would cast," or aimed "the javelin." On a later occasion Saul actually threw the javelin, and struck the wall where David had been sitting (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As a sign and pledge of his friendship, Jonathan gave David his clothes and his armour. Meil, the upper coat or cloak. Maddim is probably the armour coat (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/17-39.htm">1 Samuel 17:39</a>). This is implied in the word &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, which is repeated three times, and by which the different arms were attached more closely to &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;. For the act itself, compare the exchange of armour made by Glaucus and Diomedes (Hom. Il. vi. 230). This seems to have been a common custom in very ancient times, as we meet with it also among the early Celts (see Macpherson's Ossian). </body></html>
