It is a sign that the Spirit of God is departed from men, if, like Saul, they are peevish, envious, suspicious, and ill-natured. Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, and Saul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observe the sweetness and usefulness of God's persecuted people, and the barbarity of their persecutors.

This is a characteristic trait of Oriental manners. On the return of friends long absent, and particularly on the return of a victorious army, bands of women and children issue from the towns and villages, to form a triumphal procession, to celebrate the victory, and, as they go along, to gratify the soldiers with dancing, instrumental music, and extempore songs, in honor of the generals who have earned the highest distinction by feats of gallantry. The Hebrew women, therefore, were merely paying the customary gratulations to David as the deliverer of their country, but they committed a great indiscretion by praising a subject at the expense of their sovereign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Answered one another; </span> singing by parts alternately. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">David his ten thousands; </span> so they said, because David killed Goliath, which was the principal cause of all the following slaughter of the Philistines. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the women answered one another as they played,....

Michal probably would not have despised David for playing an instrument of music during a religious ceremony; it was the posturing of the dance which seemed to her beneath the dignity of a king. So these women danced in alternate choruses to the beating of their tambourines and triangles. In <a href="/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>, where, however, it is in a different conjugation, the verb is translated "to make sport."
