How uncommon is such prudence and discretion, especially under insults and provocations! Let us inquire if we imitate this part of the exemplary character before us. Are we behaving wisely in all our ways? Is there no sinful omission, no rashness of spirit, nothing wrong in our conduct? Opposition and perverseness in others, will not excuse wrong tempers in us, but should increase our care, and attention to the duties of our station. Consider Him that endured contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in your minds, Heb 12:3. If David magnified the honour of being son-in-law to king Saul, how should we magnify the honour of being sons to the King of kings!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A poor man and lightly esteemed - Compare <a href="/psalms/119-141.htm">Psalm 119:141</a>.

As this slaughter would have to be effected not in regular warfare, but in a sort of private raid, there would be every likelihood of David being overpowered by a rapid gathering of the Philistines and slain in attempting it. It marks the unscrupulous character of ancient warfare that the lives of enemies should thus be taken, without any public provocation, for private purposes (comp. <a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But David replied with true humility, without suspecting the craftiness of Saul: "Who am I, and what is my condition in life, my father's family in Israel, that I should become son-in-law to the king?" &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497; &#1502;&#1497; is a difficult expression, and has been translated in different ways, as the meaning which suggests itself first (viz., "what is my life") is neither reconcilable with the &#1502;&#1497; (the interrogative personal pronoun), nor suitable to the context. Gesenius (Thes. p. 471) and Bttcher give the meaning "people" for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and Ewald (Gramm. 179, b.) the meaning "family." But neither of these meanings can be established. &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; seems evidently to signify the condition in life, the relation in which a person stands to others, and &#1502;&#1497; is to be explained on the ground that David referred to the persons who formed the class to which he belonged. "My father's family" includes all his relations. David's meaning was, that neither on personal grounds, nor on account of his social standing, nor because of his lineage, could he make the slightest pretension to the honour of becoming the son-in-law of the king.</body></html>
