In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This and the following verses down to the end of <a href="/1_samuel/17-31.htm">1 Samuel 17:31</a> are omitted in the Vatican copy of the Septuagint, as are <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55-58</a>.
