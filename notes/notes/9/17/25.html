The simple meaning would seem to be freedom from personal service in the army and elsewhere, what in mediaeval history is known by the general term <span class= "ital">Corvée. </span>It also probably includes a certain exemption from taxation or enforced contributions to war expenses.<p>Ewald goes still further, and considers that the royal. promise included the elevation of the house of the victorious warrior to noble rank, as henceforth they would be “free”—“freeholders,” a family released from the ordinary service of subjects; and this high distinction, the great German scholar considers, would easily come to be looked upon as hereditary, and thus such favoured houses would form an intermediate stage between the king and the simple subject. Although it is clear that a wonderful advance in the internal development of the kingdom of the children of Israel had taken place in Saul’s reign, yet it is doubtful if the government of the first king was as yet sufficiently organised to justify us in accepting, in its fulness, the conclusion of the ingenious comment of Ewald here. It does not appear from the narrative that these promises were ever fulfilled by Saul in the case of the house of Jesse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel....">1 Samuel 17:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">The king will make his father’s house free — </span>Free from all those tributes and charges which either the court or the camp required. <span class="ital">Who is this uncircumcised Philistine? </span>&c. — Thus David expresses a high indignation that they, who were the servants of the living God, and fought under his banners, should be thus terrified by the great bulk of this idolater, as if the strength of God were not greater than that of this giant.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:12-30 Jesse little thought of sending his son to the army at that critical juncture; but the wise God orders actions and affairs, so as to serve his designs. In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Free in Israel - In all the other passages (fifteen) where this word occurs, it means free, as opposed to being a slave (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-18.htm">Deuteronomy 15:18</a>, etc.) Here it may imply a freedom from all such services and burdens as are spoken of in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. make his father's house free in Israel&#8212;His family should be exempted from the impositions and services to which the general body of the Israelites were subjected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is observable, that Saul in his great distress doth not encourage himself in God, nor seek his counsel or favour by prayers and sacrifices, but expects relief from men only.

There had manifestly been a great advance since the day when Jesse sent the king a few loaves of bread, a skin of wine, and a kid (<a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>). Still we cannot imagine that Saul had introduced taxes, nor was the political organisation of the State ripe enough for so advanced a state of things. The words more probably refer to freedom from personal service in the army and elsewhere; though it is quite possible that on special occasions contributions may have been levied, and presents, no doubt, were constantly being made to the king, though on no regular system. <span class="cmt_word">Taketh away the reproach.</span> The noun formed from the verb rendered <span class="accented">defy in</span> ver. 10, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised</span>.
