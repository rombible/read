A valley between them. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:160) describes the spot from personal observation thus: "Saul, coming down by the highway from the land of Benjamin, encamped by the valley on one of the low hills; and between the two hosts was the <span class="accented">gai</span> or ravine." In the A.V. no exactness of rendering is ever attempted, and both the <span class="accented">emek</span>, the broad strath or valley of Elah, with gently sloping sides, and the flag, the narrow, precipitous ravine, are equally rendered <span class="accented">valley.</span> Really the <span class="accented">gai</span> is most remarkable, and fully explains how the two hosts could remain in face of one another so long without fighting; for Conder proceeds, "Two points require to be made clear as to the episode of David's battle with Goliath: one was the meaning of the expression <span class="accented">gai</span> or ravine; the other was the source whence David took the 'smooth stones.' A visit to the spot explains both. In the middle of the broad, open valley we found a deep trench with vertical sides, impassable except at certain places - a valley in a valley, and a natural barrier between the two hosts. The sides and bed of this trench are strewn with rounded and waterworn pebbles, which would have been well fitted for David's sling. Here, then, we may picture to ourselves the two hosts, covering the low, rocky hills opposite to each other, and half hidden among the lentisk bushes. Between them was the rich expanse of ripening barley, and the red banks of the torrent, with its white, shingly bed. Behind all were the distant blue hill walls of Judah, whence Saul had just come down. The mail clad champion advanced from the west through the low corn, with his mighty lance perhaps tufted with feathers, his brazen helmet shining in the sun. From the east a ruddy boy in his white shirt and sandals, armed with a goat's hair sling, came down to the brook, and, according to the poetic fancy of the Rabbis, the pebbles were given voices, and cried, 'By us shalt thou overcome the giant.' The champion fell from an unseen cause, and the wild  Philistines fled to the mouth of the valley, where Gath stood towering on its white chalk cliff, a frontier fortress, the key to the high road leading to the corn lands of Judah and to the vineyards of Hebron." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Saul thereupon sent to ask Jesse for his son David; and Jesse sent him with a present of an ass's burden of bread, a bottle of wine, and a buck-kid. Instead of the singular expression &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;, an ass with bread, i.e., laden with bread, the lxx read &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1495;&#1502;&#1512;, and rendered it &#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;; but this is certainly wrong, as they were not accustomed to measure bread in bushels. These presents show how simple were the customs of Israel and in the court of Saul at that time.</body></html>
