The most probable estimate is about ten feet three inches. Among parallel instances of gigantic stature may be quoted Pusio and Secundilla, who lived in the reign of Augustus, and are said by Pliny (<span class="ital">Nat. Hist</span>. VII. 16) to have been over ten feet high. Josephus says that a certain Eleazar the giant who was sent to the emperor Tiberius, was seven cubits high.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">A champion.</span> Literally, "a man of the two middles," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who enters the space between the two armies in order to decide the contest by a single combat. <span class="cmt_word">Of Gath.</span> In <a href="/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a> this town is mentioned, together with Gaza and Ashdod, as still having among its inhabitants men of the race of Anak. <span class="cmt_word">Whose height was six cubits and a span.</span> In our measure his height was eight feet five and one-third inches; for the cubit is sixteen inches, and the span (really the hand-breadth) is five and one-third inches. A span, <span class="accented">sit</span>, is eight inches, but the word used here is <span class="accented">zereth.</span> See on these measures, Conder, 'Handbook,' p. 79. This height, though very great, has been attained to in modern times. <span class="cmt_word">Armed with a coat of mail.</span> Literally, "clothed in a shirt of scales," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a corselet made of metal scales sewn on cloth so as to overlap one another. It was flexible, and protected the back and sides as well as the kent. <span class="cmt_word">Five thousand shekels of brass.</span> Really copper, as brass was then unknown. Conder gives the shekel as equal to two-thirds of an ounce. This would make the corselet weigh at least two hundred weight, an enormous load to carry even for a short time. Goliath's other equipments correspond in heaviness, and largely exceed the weight of medieval suits of armour. <span class="cmt_word">Greaves of brass upon his legs.</span> The thighs were protected by the corselet, so that only the legs required defensive armour. This would account for the weight of the corselet, as it was much longer than the cuirass, as worn by the Greeks and Romans. <span class="cmt_word">A target.</span> Really, "a javelin." It was carried at the back, ready to be taken in the hand and thrown at the enemy when required. The versions have a different reading - <span class="accented">magan</span>, shield, for <span class="accented">chidon</span>, javelin. The shield was carried before him by an armour bearer. <span class="cmt_word">The staff.</span> The written text has a word which usually signifies <span class="accented">shaft, arrow</span>, for which the Kri substitutes <span class="accented">wood</span>, the noun actually found in <a href="/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>; but most probably the word used here is an archaic name for the handle or staff of a spear. <span class="cmt_word">Six hundred shekels.</span> The weight of the iron head of the spear would be about twenty-five pounds. However tall and strong Goliath may have been, yet with all this vast weight of metal his movements must have been slow and unready. He was got up, in bet, more to tell upon the imagination than for real fighting, and though, like a castle, he might have been invincible if attacked with sword and spear, he was much too encumbered with defensive armour to be capable of assuming the offensive against a light armed enemy. To David belongs the credit of seeing that the Philistine champion was a huge imposition. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David came to Saul and stood before him, i.e., served him by playing upon his harp, Saul took a great liking to him, and nominated him his armour-bearer, i.e., his adjutant, as a proof of his satisfaction with him, and sent to Jesse to say, "Let David stand before me," i.e., remain in my service, "for he has found favour in my sight." The historian then adds (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>): "When the (evil) spirit of God came to Saul (&#1488;&#1500;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-9.htm">1 Samuel 19:9</a>, is really equivalent to &#1506;&#1500;), and David took the harp and played, there came refreshing to Saul, and he became well, and the evil spirit departed from him." Thus David came to Saul's court, and that as his benefactor, without Saul having any suspicion of David's divine election to be king of Israel. This guidance on the part of God was a school of preparation to David for his future calling. In the first place, he was thereby lifted out of his quiet and homely calling in the country into the higher sphere of court-life; and thus an opportunity was afforded him not only for intercourse with men of high rank, and to become acquainted with the affairs of the kingdom, but also to display those superior gifts of his intellect and heart with which God had endowed him, and thereby to gain the love and confidence of the people. But at the same time he was also brought into a severe school of affliction, in which his inner man was to be trained by conflicts from without and within, so that he might become a man after God's heart, who should be well fitted to found the true monarchy in Israel. </body></html>
