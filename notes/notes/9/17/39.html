As he had never worn such things before, not being used to go armed, he wished to try how he could walk in them; and finding that they were likely rather to encumber him than facilitate his enterprise, he begged leave to lay them aside. “David marched with difficulty, as not accustomed to these; therefore he said to Saul, I cannot go with these arms, for I am not accustomed to them; and David put them off.” — Houb.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:31-39 A shepherd lad, come the same morning from keeping sheep, had more courage than all the mighty men of Israel. Thus God often sends good words to his Israel, and does great things for them, by the weak and foolish things of the world. As he had answered his brother's passion with meekness, so David answered Saul's fear with faith. When David kept sheep, he proved himself very careful and tender of his flock. This reminds us of Christ, the good Shepherd, who not only ventured, but laid down his life for the sheep. Our experience ought to encourage us to trust in God, and be bold in the way of duty. He that has delivered, does and will continue to do so. David gained leave to fight the Philistine. Not being used to such armour as Saul put upon him, he was not satisfied to go in that manner; this was from the Lord, that it might more plainly appear he fought and conquered in faith, and that the victory was from Him who works by the feeblest and most despised means and instruments. It is not to be inquired how excellent any thing is, but how proper. Let Saul's coat be ever so rich, and his armour ever so strong, what is David the better if they fit him not? But faith, prayer, truth, and righteousness; the whole armour of God, and the mind that was in Christ; are equally needful for all the servants of the Lord, whatever may be their work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His beard - Put here for his throat, or under jaw; neither lion nor bear has a beard properly speaking. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38, 39. Saul armed David with his armour&#8212;The ancient Hebrews were particularly attentive to the personal safety of their warriors, and hence Saul equipped the youthful champion with his own defensive accoutrements, which would be of the best style.

The article before &#1488;&#1512;&#1497; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; points out these animals as the well-known beasts of prey. By the expression &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; the bear is subordinated to the lion, or rather placed afterwards, as something which came in addition to it; so that &#1488;&#1514; is to be taken as a nota accus. (vid., Ewald, 277, a), though it is not to be understood as implying that the lion and the bear went together in search of prey. The subordination or addition is merely a logical one: not only the lion, but also the bear, which seized the sheep, did David slay. &#1494;&#1492;, which we find in most of the editions since the time of Jac. Chayim, 1525, is an error in writing, or more correctly in hearing, for &#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, a sheep. "And I went out after it; and when it rose up against me, I seized it by its beard, and smote it, and killed it." &#1494;&#1511;&#1503;, beard and chin, signifies the bearded chin. Thenius proposes, though without any necessity, to alter &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1493; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, for the simple but weak reason, that neither lions nor bears have any actual beard. We have only to think, for example, of the &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; in Homer (Il. xv. 275, xvii. 109), or the barbam vellere mortuo leoni of Martial (x. 9). Even in modern times we read of lions having been killed by Arabs with a stick (see Rosenmller, Bibl. Althk. iv. 2, pp. 132-3). The constant use of the singular suffix is sufficient to show, that when David speaks of the lion and the bear, he connects together two different events, which took place at different times, and then proceeds to state how he smote both the one and the other of the two beasts of prey.</body></html>
