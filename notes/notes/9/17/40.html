It has been well said he was like one armed with a rifle, while his enemy had only a spear and a sword, and if only he could take sure aim the result was absolutely certain.<p>Wordsworth, again, on the words “chose him five smooth stones out of the brook,” refers to Augustine’s Commentary, who finds here a deep mystical signification. It is an admirable specimen of the Patristic School of Exposition, which, although quaint, and not unfrequently “far-fetched,” will always, and with good reason, possess great power over the minds of the earnest and devout student. “So our Divine David, the Good Shepherd of Bethlehem, when He went forth at the temptation to meet Satan—our ghostly Goliath—chose <span class= "ital">five stones </span>out of the brook. He took the five books of Moses out of the flowing stream of Judaism. He took what was solid out of what was fluid. He took what was permanent out of what was transitory. He took what was moral and perpetual out of what was ceremonial and temporary. He took stones out of a brook, and with one of these He overthrew Satan. All Christ’s answers to the tempter are <span class= "ital">moral </span>precepts, taken from <span class= "ital">one </span>Book of the Law (Deuteronomy), and He prefaced His replies with the same words, ‘<span class= "ital">It is written;’ </span>and with this sling and stone of Scripture He laid our Goliath low, and He has taught us by His example how we may also vanquish the tempter.” (See St. Augustine, Sermon 32)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/17-40.htm" title="And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a money; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine....">1 Samuel 17:40-41</a></span>. <span class="ital">He took his staff — </span>His shepherd’s staff.

The article before &#1488;&#1512;&#1497; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; points out these animals as the well-known beasts of prey. By the expression &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; the bear is subordinated to the lion, or rather placed afterwards, as something which came in addition to it; so that &#1488;&#1514; is to be taken as a nota accus. (vid., Ewald, 277, a), though it is not to be understood as implying that the lion and the bear went together in search of prey. The subordination or addition is merely a logical one: not only the lion, but also the bear, which seized the sheep, did David slay. &#1494;&#1492;, which we find in most of the editions since the time of Jac. Chayim, 1525, is an error in writing, or more correctly in hearing, for &#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, a sheep. "And I went out after it; and when it rose up against me, I seized it by its beard, and smote it, and killed it." &#1494;&#1511;&#1503;, beard and chin, signifies the bearded chin. Thenius proposes, though without any necessity, to alter &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1493; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, for the simple but weak reason, that neither lions nor bears have any actual beard. We have only to think, for example, of the &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; in Homer (Il. xv. 275, xvii. 109), or the barbam vellere mortuo leoni of Martial (x. 9). Even in modern times we read of lions having been killed by Arabs with a stick (see Rosenmller, Bibl. Althk. iv. 2, pp. 132-3). The constant use of the singular suffix is sufficient to show, that when David speaks of the lion and the bear, he connects together two different events, which took place at different times, and then proceeds to state how he smote both the one and the other of the two beasts of prey.</body></html>
