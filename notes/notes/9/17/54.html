Jerusalem was now become a noted city, which was the reason why he brought his head thither. Some think, however, that this is spoken of a future action, namely, that when David was come to the kingdom, and had made Jerusalem his royal seat, he ordered the scull of Goliath to be fixed up in some public place there, as a monument of this most signal victory. <span class="ital">But he put his armour in his tent — </span>A tent which probably was set up for David on this occasion.

Let not the strong man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his armour. God resists the proud, and pours contempt on those who defy him and his people. No one ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. The history is recorded, that all may exert themselves for the honour of God, and the support of his cause, with bold and unshaken reliance on him. There is one conflict in which all the followers of the Lamb are, and must be engaged; one enemy, more formidable than Goliath, still challenges the armies of Israel. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Go forth to battle with the faith of David, and the powers of darkness shall not stand against you.

After he had been introduced with it to Saul, and when he had passed through various cities in Israel, carrying the head in triumph; where he was congratulated by the women, who came out singing and dancing, and speaking highly in his commendation and praise: why he carried it to Jerusalem is not easy to say, this not being a royal city, nor was it wholly in the hands of the Israelites; part of it indeed was in the possession of Judah and Benjamin, but the stronghold of Zion was possessed by the Jebusites; and it is generally thought that it was to the terror of them that the head of Goliath was carried there. R. Joseph Kimchi thinks, that Nob, where the tabernacle was at this time, was surnamed Jerusalem, but for what reason cannot be said: <p>but he put his armour in his tent; not where the army was encamped before the engagement; for David had not his tent there, and beside the camp broke up upon this victory obtained; but rather in his tent or apartment at Bethlehem, when he returned thither, and where he laid up the armour he took from Goliath; though Abarbinel thinks, and so other Jews (q), that by his tent is meant the tabernacle of the Lord, called David's, because of his attachment to it; and certain it is that the sword of Goliath was either now, or at least hereafter, laid up there, see <a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>; where all that went to sacrifice might see it, and call to mind this wonderful instance of the power and goodness of God, and praise him for it. <p>(q) Hieron.

The citadel still remained in the hands of the Jebusites, though the lower city had been captured (<a href="/joshua/15-63.htm" title="As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.">Joshua 15:63</a>). It seems best therefore to suppose that David deposited the head as a votive offering in the Tabernacle at <span class="ital">Nob</span> which was close to Jerusalem. We know that he afterwards placed Goliath’s sword there, and possibly the rest of his armour along with it. This is preferable to the conjecture that the historian here relates by anticipation what David did eventually when he occupied Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in his tent</span>] So long as the army remained in the field he kept it as a trophy of his victory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We might naturally expect that David would celebrate his victory by a Psalm of thanksgiving. No extant Psalm however can with certainty be referred to this occasion. The Sept. adds “against Goliath” to the title of Psalms 144 (Sept. 143), but without any sufficient probability; and the Psalm appended to the Psalter in the Sept., which professes to belong to this period, is certainly not authentic. A translation of it may be found in Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>, I. 403.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David...brought it to Jerusalem</span>. This is an anticipation of later history. The Jebusites at this time held Jerusalem; but when David had taken it from them, he removed the head of Goliath thither, and the narrator, following the usual custom of Hebrew historians, mentions the ultimate fate of this trophy here (see on 1 Samuel 16:21). <span class="cmt_word">He put his armour in his tent.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he carried it to his home (see on 1 Samuel 2:35; 4:10; 13:2, etc.), where it became his private property.

Abravanel supposes that by David's tent was meant the tabernacle of Jehovah, but this would surely have been stated more fully. Either, however, now, or at some later period, David must have presented the sword as an offering to the tabernacle, as it was laid up at Nob, whence he took it with him in his flight (see <a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>).
