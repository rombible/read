And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.">1Samuel 17:55-58</a>), he, the compiler, was perfectly aware that David had already visited the court of Saul in the capacity of a musician (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/16-18.htm" title="Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.">1Samuel 16:18-23</a>). As has been already suggested, these historical books of the Old Testament are, no doubt, made up from contemporaneous documents, stored up most probably in one or other of the prophetic schools. It is, therefore, to be expected that certain facts will be found occasionally repeated. The circumstances connected with the healing influence of the music of David in the case of the <span class= "ital">soul malady </span>of King Saul were of course preserved with great care and detail in these “schools,” where music and poetry were so highly cultivated and esteemed. We have here many of the very words of the original narrative preserved to us. Similarly the story of the first exploit of David is incorporated in the history probably unchanged. Each of these ancient and favourite “memories” of David, as being complete in themselves, would of course contain some of the same details.<p>The apparent ignorance of Saul and Abner respecting the young shepherd’s family will be discussed in the note on <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-55.htm" title="And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?

In times of general formality and lukewarmness, every degree of zeal which implies readiness to go further, or to venture more in the cause of God than others, will be blamed as pride and ambition, and by none more than by near relations, like Eliab, or negligent superiors. It was a trial of David's meekness, patience, and constancy. He had right and reason on his side, and did not render railing for railing; with a soft answer he turned away his brother's wrath. This conquest of his own passion was more honourable than that of Goliath. Those who undertake great and public services, must not think it strange if they are spoken ill of, and opposed by those from whom they expect support and assistance. They must humbly go on with their work, in the face not only of enemies' threats, but of friends' slights and suspicions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David went ... - "Was gone," referring to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-19.htm">1 Samuel 16:19-20</a>.

It seems that when he was called to the court of Saul, that he did not continue there, but was going and coming, was there at certain times when Saul wanted him; and so when in the camp he might go and return as there was occasion for it: <p>to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem; for though he was anointed king, and was called to court, yet such was his humility, that he condescended to attend this employment of keeping sheep; and though Jesse knew all this, yet he kept him at home to this business, when it might be more reasonably thought he would have lain in the way of preferment, had he followed Saul to the camp, and appeared in the army; but he chose to leave things to the providence of God to work the way for him, and by which he was directed to take the following step, though perhaps without any design to his son's future promotion. <p>(u) Antiqu. l. 6. c. 8. sect. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But David <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</span><p>(c) To serve Saul, 1Sa 16:19.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">David went and returned from Saul</span>] From <a href="/context/1_samuel/16-21.htm" title="And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer....">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a> it might have been supposed that David was already permanently resident at Saul’s court. This verse however states that he returned home when his services were not required at court, and at the time of the Philistine war was with his father at Bethlehem. We must assume either that <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm" title="And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.">1 Samuel 16:21</a> describes by anticipation what happened eventually after the Philistine war; or that the appointment as armour-bearer was a nominal commission, and that, as he was young and inexperienced, his attendance in camp was not yet required. Joab had ten armour-bearers (<a href="/2_samuel/18-15.htm" title="And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.">2 Samuel 18:15</a>), and Saul probably many more.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David went and returned from Saul.</span> This is a very important statement, as it shows that the writer, in spite of what is said in vers. 55-58, knew that David had visited Saul at his court, and become personally known to him. Apparently it had been but a short visit, possibly because after the fit of melancholy had passed away there was no return of it for the present; and if David had been back at Bethlehem for two or three years, a young man changes so much in appearance at David's time of life that it is no wonder that neither Saul nor Abner recognised him in his shepherd's dress. For some reason, then, or other David had not remained with Saul at Gibeah, but had resumed his pastoral life at Bethlehem, and the statements made in <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21-23</a> belong to the time immediately after the combat with Goliath, and not before. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"If he can fight with me, and kill me, we will be your servants; if I overcome him, and slay him, ye shall be our servants, and serve us."
