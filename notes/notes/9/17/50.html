Had his heart for one instant failed him—as, indeed, it well might; had he not possessed a confidence which nothing could shake in an unseen Helper—or had his skill as a marksman failed him in the slightest degree, the Philistine with one blow would have laid David lifeless at his feet; or had the active shepherd boy eluded his giant antagonist, it must have been by flight. In any case, the single combat upon which Israel had staked so much would have gone against the chosen people.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:48-58 See how frail and uncertain life is, even when a man thinks himself best fortified; how quickly, how easily, and by how small a matter, the passage may be opened for life to go out, and death to enter! Let not the strong man glory in his strength, nor the armed man in his armour. God resists the proud, and pours contempt on those who defy him and his people. No one ever hardened his heart against God and prospered. The history is recorded, that all may exert themselves for the honour of God, and the support of his cause, with bold and unshaken reliance on him. There is one conflict in which all the followers of the Lamb are, and must be engaged; one enemy, more formidable than Goliath, still challenges the armies of Israel. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Go forth to battle with the faith of David, and the powers of darkness shall not stand against you.

The narrator also calls attention to the fact that David relied upon his sling alone, for <span class="cmt_word">there was no sword in the hand of David.</span> Slings probably were regarded as useful only to harass an enemy, while swords, which they had only lately been able to procure (<a href="/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>), were regarded as the real weapons of offence. David, therefore, completes his victory by killing Goliath with his own sword as he lay stunned upon the ground. As Ahimelech considered it fit for David's own use (<a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>), it was probably not so monstrous in size as Goliath's other weapons. <span class="cmt_word">Champion</span> is not the word so rendered in vers. 4, 23, but that used in <a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a> for "a <span class="accented">hero</span> of valour." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When he saw David, "he looked at him, and despised him," i.e., he looked at him contemptuously, because he was a youth (as in <a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>); "and then said to him, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with sticks?" (the plural &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is used in contemptuous exaggeration of the armour of David, which appeared so thoroughly unfit for the occasion); "and cursed David by his God (i.e., making use of the name of Jehovah in his cursing, and thus defying not David only, but the God of Israel also), and finished with the challenge, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of heaven and the beasts of the field" (to eat). It was with such threats as these that Homer's heroes used to defy one another (vid., Hector's threat, for example, in Il. xiii. 831-2).</body></html>
