The reader of the <span class= "ital">Iliad </span>will ever readily call to mind—in colloquies before the deadly duel—words not altogether unlike the haughty, boastful challenge of the giant Philistine.

If his formidable appearance, or great reputation for physical strength and heroism, deterred any from accepting the challenge, he used to parade himself within hearing of the enemy's lines, specify in a loud, boastful, bravado style, defying them, and pouring out torrents of abuse and insolence to provoke their resentment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants,....
