It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The stone Ezel - It is not mentioned elsewhere, except possibly in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>, where see the note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. when thou hast stayed three days&#8212;either with your family at Beth-lehem, or wherever you find it convenient.<p>come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand&#8212;Hebrew, "in the day," or "time of the business," when the same matter was under inquiry formerly (1Sa 19:22).<p>remain by the stone Ezel&#8212;Hebrew, "the stone of the way"; a sort of milestone which directed travellers.

The word &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; must be supplied in thought to &#1497;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/7-18.htm">2 Chronicles 7:18</a>. "And Jehovah required it (what Jonathan had predicted) at the hand of David's enemies." Understood in this manner, the second clause contains a remark of the historian himself, namely, that Jonathan's words were really fulfilled in due time.
