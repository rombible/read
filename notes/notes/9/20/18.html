It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others.

Their Covenant Renewed by Oath.<p>11. Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go into the field&#8212;The private dialogue, which is here detailed at full length, presents a most beautiful exhibition of these two amiable and noble-minded friends. Jonathan was led, in the circumstances, to be the chief speaker. The strength of his attachment, his pure disinterestedness, his warm piety, his invocation to God (consisting of a prayer and a solemn oath combined), the calm and full expression he gave of his conviction that his own family were, by the divine will, to be disinherited, and David elevated to the possession of the throne, the covenant entered into with David on behalf of his descendants, and the imprecation (1Sa 20:16) denounced on any of them who should violate his part of the conditions, the reiteration of this covenant on both sides (1Sa 20:17) to make it indissoluble&#8212;all this indicates such a power of mutual affection, such magnetic attractiveness in the character of David, such susceptibility and elevation of feeling in the heart of Jonathan, that this interview for dramatic interest and moral beauty stands unrivalled in the records of human friendship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy seat, </span> i.e. the place where David used to sit at meals with Saul.

For <span class="cmt_word">when thou hast stayed three days</span>, at which all the versions stumble, a slight alteration gives the right sense: "And on the third day." David on the third day was to <span class="cmt_word">go down quickly</span> - Hebrew, "greatly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he was to go a long way down into the valley. The rendering <span class="accented">quickly</span> is taken from the Vulgate, but makes no sense. It did not matter whether David went fast or slow, as he was to hide there for some time, but it was important that David should be far away, so that no prying eye might chance to catch sight of him. <span class="cmt_word">When the business was in hand.</span> Literally, "the day of the business," probably that narrated in <a href="/1_samuel/19-2.htm">1 Samuel 19:2-7</a>.

As the name Ezel is formed from a verb signifying <span class="accented">to go</span>, some understand by it a <span class="accented">road stone</span>, a stone to mark the way. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the field, where they were both entirely free from observation, Jonathan first of all renewed his covenant with David, by vowing to him on oath that he would give him information of his father's feelings towards him (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>); and then entreated him, with a certain presentiment that David would one day be king, even then to maintain his love towards him and his family for ever (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-16</a>); and lastly, he made David swear again concerning his love (<a href="/1_samuel/20-17.htm">1 Samuel 20:17</a>), and then gave him the sign by which he would communicate the promised information (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-18.htm">1 Samuel 20:18-23</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12-15</a><p><a href="/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a> are connected. Jonathan commences with a solemn invocation of God: "Jehovah, God of Israel!" and thus introduces his oath. We have neither to supply "Jehovah is witness," nor "as truly as Jehovah liveth," as some have suggested. "When I inquire of my father about this time to-morrow, the day after to-morrow (a concise mode of saying 'to-morrow or the day after'), and behold it is (stands) well for David, and then I do not send to thee and make it known to thee, Jehovah shall do so to Jonathan," etc. ("The Lord do so," etc., the ordinary formula used in an oath: see <a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>). The other case is then added without an adversative particle: "If it should please my father evil against thee (lit. as regards evil), "I will make it known to thee, and let thee go, that thou mayest go in peace; and Jehovah be with thee, as He has been with my father." In this wish there is expressed the presentiment that David would one day occupy that place in Israel which Saul occupied then, i.e., the throne. - In <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/20-15.htm">1 Samuel 20:15</a> the Masoretic text gives no appropriate meaning. Luther's rendering, in which he follows the Rabbins and takes the first &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a>) by itself, and then completes the sentence from the context ("but if I do it not, show me no mercy, because I live, not even if I die"), contains indeed a certain permissible sense when considered in itself; but it is hardly reconcilable with what follows, "and do not tear away thy compassion for ever from my house." The request that he would show no compassion to him (Jonathan) even if he died, and yet would not withdraw his compassion from his house for ever, contains an antithesis which would have been expressed most clearly and unambiguously in the words themselves, if this had been really what Jonathan intended to say. De Wette's rendering gives a still more striking contradiction: "But let not (Jehovah be with thee) if I still live, and thou showest not the love of Jehovah to me, that I do not, and thou withdrawest not thy love from my house for ever." There is really no other course open than to follow the Syriac and Arabic, as Maurer, Thenius, and Ewald have done, and change the &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; in the first two clauses in <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14</a> into &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;, according to the analogy of the form &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;   (<a href="/1_samuel/14-30.htm">1 Samuel 14:30</a>), and to render the passage thus: "And mayest thou, if I still live, mayest thou show to me the favour of the Lord, and not if I do, not withdraw thy favour from my house for ever, not even (&#1493;&#1500;&#1488;) when Jehovah shall cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth!" "The favour of Jehovah" is favour such as Jehovah shall cut off," etc., shows very clearly Jonathan's conviction that Jehovah would give to David a victory over all his enemies.</body></html>
