[The “arrow” sign would have been enough to have warned David; and had he not seen that Jonathan was alone and waiting for him, David would, from his place of hiding, have made his escape unseen.] The Chaldee here reads, “from the stone of the sign (or the stone Atha) which is on the south;” the LXX. (Vat. MS.), “from the Argab;” Alex. MS., “from sleep.” The different versions, more or less, have repeated the statement in <a href="/1_samuel/20-19.htm" title="And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.">1Samuel 20:19</a>, failing altogether to understand the two Hebrew words <span class= "ital">mêêtzel hannegev, </span>translated in our English Version, “out of a place toward the south.”<p><span class= "bld">And fell on his face.</span>—Josephus’ words, in his traditional account of the event, explain David’s reason for this. “He did obeisance, and called him the saviour of his life.”<p><span class= "bld">Until David exceeded.</span>—The expression is a strange one, and apparently signifies either simply that while Jonathan wept bitterly at the parting, David wept <span class= "ital">still more, </span>or else that “David broke down,” that is, “was completely mastered by his grief.”—Dean <span class= "ital">Payne Smith. </span>The LXX. translators here are quite unintelligible in their rendering, which represents David as weeping “until a (or the) great consummation.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/20-41.htm" title="And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.">1 Samuel 20:41</a></span>. <span class="ital">And fell on his face to the ground, </span>&c. — After three bows, he fell on his face; out of reverence to Jonathan, as the king’s son, and in tenderness to him, as his most generous friend. <span class="ital">They kissed one another, and wept one with another — </span>Nothing can be imagined more generous, and, at the same time, more soft and moving, than this meeting of these two friends. Jonathan seems, out of tenderness to David, to have suppressed some part of his grief. But David, who reflected that he was now taking his last leave of a friend who had often saved his life, and was now just come from speaking in his favour, at the imminent hazard of his own life, could not restrain himself. The thought of taking a farewell of so invaluable a friend, and, at the same time, of leaving all his comforts, even those of God’s sanctuary, was so bitter, that he could not bear it with moderation; and therefore is said to have exceeded. Perhaps his temper was more tender, and his passions stronger, than those of Jonathan; who, however, seems evidently to have done great violence to his feelings, and to have had no little difficulty so to restrain his grief as not to sink his friend too much, but to send him away with a calm confidence in God, and religious tranquillity and peace of mind.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:35-42 The separation of two such faithful friends was grievous to both, but David's case was the more deplorable, for David was leaving all his comforts, even those of God's sanctuary.

The Septuagint in both places has "argab," a word meaning a "heap of stones."

Abarbinel observes, that bowing three; times was fit and proper to be done to a king; once at the place from whence they first see him, the second time in the middle of the way to him, and the third time when come to him; but though this may have been a custom in more modern times, it is a question whether it obtained so early; however it is certain bowing was as ancient, and therefore Xenophon (z) is mistaken in ascribing it to Cyrus as the first introducer of this custom; and be it that he was the first that began it among the Persians, it was in use with others before, as this behaviour of David shows: <p>and they kissed one another; as friends about to part: <p>and wept one with another: as not knowing whether they should ever see each other's face any more: <p>until David exceeded; in weeping more than Jonathan; he having more to part with, not only him his dear friend, but his wife and family, and other dear friends and people of God, and especially the sanctuary and service of God, which of all things lay nearest his heart, and most distressed him; see <a href="/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>; and many of his psalms on this occasion.
