Mournfully he looked on to his father’s downfall and his own (Jonathan’s) premature death; and in full view of this he bespoke the interest of his friend—though his friend would probably in a few hours become an exile and outlaw—on behalf of his own (Jonathan’s) children, who would, he foresaw, before many years had expired, be landless, homeless orphans.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm" title="And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:">1 Samuel 20:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">And thou shalt show me the kindness of the Lord — </span>That kindness to which thou hast engaged thyself, in the covenant sworn between thee and me in God’s presence.

It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours.

Their Covenant Renewed by Oath.<p>11. Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go into the field&#8212;The private dialogue, which is here detailed at full length, presents a most beautiful exhibition of these two amiable and noble-minded friends. Jonathan was led, in the circumstances, to be the chief speaker. The strength of his attachment, his pure disinterestedness, his warm piety, his invocation to God (consisting of a prayer and a solemn oath combined), the calm and full expression he gave of his conviction that his own family were, by the divine will, to be disinherited, and David elevated to the possession of the throne, the covenant entered into with David on behalf of his descendants, and the imprecation (1Sa 20:16) denounced on any of them who should violate his part of the conditions, the reiteration of this covenant on both sides (1Sa 20:17) to make it indissoluble&#8212;all this indicates such a power of mutual affection, such magnetic attractiveness in the character of David, such susceptibility and elevation of feeling in the heart of Jonathan, that this interview for dramatic interest and moral beauty stands unrivalled in the records of human friendship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And wilt thou not, if I shall then be alive, </span>( to wit, when <span class="ital">the Lord shall be with thee, as he hath been with my father</span>, as he now said, i.e. when God shall have advanced thee to the kingdom, as he did him,)<span class="ital"> yea, wilt thou not</span> (the same particle twice repeated for asseveration, i.e. I am well assured that thou wilt) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">show me the kindness of the Lord; </span> i.e. either such kindness as the Lord hath showed to thee in preserving thy life in the midst of so many and such great dangers; or that kindness to which thou hast engaged thyself; in the covenant sworn between thee and me in God’s presence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That I die not; </span> that thou do not kill me or mine, as princes of another line use to kill the nearest relations of the former line, from whom the kingdom was translated to them; which they do either by way of revenge, or in policy, and reason of state, to secure the kingdom to themselves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt not only, while yet I live, show me the kindness of the Lord,.... Such kindness as is well pleasing in the sight of God, and imitate what he shows to men, and which was covenanted, promised, and agreed to in the presence of the Lord, when David and Jonathan entered into covenant with each other; this Jonathan did not doubt of, and therefore did not make this a request: <p>that I die not; he had no fear nor dread on his mind, should David come to the throne while he was alive, that he would take away his life; which was usually done by tyrants and usurpers, when there were any that had a fairer title, and better claim to the throne than they. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> that I die not:</span><p>(h) I know that if you were given the kingdom now, you would not destroy me, but show yourself friendly to my posterity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14, 15</span>. Convinced that David will succeed to the kingdom, Jonathan exacts from him a promise to shew kindness to his posterity after his death as well as to himself during his life time. His words, like Saul’s in ch. <a href="/1_samuel/14-21.htm" title="Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.">1 Samuel 14:21</a>, are prompted by a fear lest even David should conform to the barbarous Oriental custom by which the first king of a new dynasty often tried to secure himself on the throne by murdering his predecessor’s family. Cp. <a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:">1 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that urinates against a wall, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.">1 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-6.htm" title="Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be mine, and if you will listen to my voice, take you the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.">2 Kings 10:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm" title="And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.">2 Kings 11:1</a>. David fulfilled his promise by shewing kindness to Mephibosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/9-1.htm" title="And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?">2 Samuel 9:1</a> ff; <a href="/2_samuel/21-7.htm" title="But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.">2 Samuel 21:7</a>). This is clearly the general sense of the passage, though the exact rendering is doubtful. (1) Retaining the Heb. text we may translate: “And wilt thou not, if I am still alive (when thou comest to the throne), yea wilt thou not shew me the kindness of Jehovah, that I die not? And thou shalt not cut off, &c.” But this involves a very harsh construction, and it is perhaps best (2) to alter the text slightly, and translate: “And mayest thou, if I am still alive, yea mayest thou shew me the kindness of Jehovah: and if I die, thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever, &c.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - The construction of this passage is very difficult if we retain the three negatives of the Masoretic text; but most commentators, following the reading of the Syriac as regards at least one of them, consider that the Masorites have been mistaken in the vowels which they have attached to the consonants (see on 1 Samuel 1:7). Read with other vowels, two of these negatives become interjections of desire - <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">that</span>; and the whole may be translated, "And O that, while I still live, yea, O that thou wouldst show me the kindness of Jehovah, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> great unfailing kindness, such as was that of Jehovah to Israel, - that I die not, nor shalt thou cut off thy kindness from my house forever." It was the sanguinary custom in the East on a change of dynasty to put all the seed royal to death (<a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-11.htm">1 Kings 16:11</a>, etc., and comp. <a href="/2_samuel/19-28.htm">2 Samuel 19:28</a>). As then Jonathan foresaw that it was Jehovah's will to transfer the kingdom to David, he binds him by the memory of his own true love to him to show mercy to his race. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David made sure that Jonathan would grant this request on account of his friendship, as he had brought him into a covenant of Jehovah with himself. David calls the covenant of friendship with Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>) a covenant of Jehovah, because he had made it with a solemn invocation of Jehovah. But in order to make quite sure of the fulfilment of his request on the part of Jonathan, David added, "But if there is a fault in me, do thou kill me (&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; used to strengthen the suffix); for why wilt thou bring me to thy father?" sc., that he may put me to death.</body></html>
