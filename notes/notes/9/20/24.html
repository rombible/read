In great peril present opportunities for Divine ordinances may be waved. But it is bad for us, except in case of necessity, to omit any opportunity of statedly attending on them. Jonathan did wisely and well for himself and family, to secure an interest in David, yet for this he is blamed. It is good to take God's people for our people. It will prove to our advantage at last, however it may now be thought against our interest. Saul was outrageous.

The omission of the statement that Jonathan <span class="accented">sat down</span> makes the passage obscure, and the versions bungle in rendering it, but there can be little doubt that these words ought to be supplied. <span class="cmt_word">He is not clean.</span> Saul supposed that some ceremonial defilement (see <a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2-16</a>) had befallen David, and as the new moon was a religious festival, this would necessarily prevent his attendance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He then discussed the sign with him for letting him know about his father's state of mind: "To-morrow is new moon, and thou wilt be missed, for thy seat will be empty," sc., at Saul's table (see at <a href="/1_samuel/20-5.htm">1 Samuel 20:5</a>). "And on the third day come down quickly (from thy sojourning place), and go to the spot where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the deed, and place thyself by the side of the stone Ezel." The first words in this (19th) verse are not without difficulty. The meaning "on the third day" for the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; cannot be sustained by parallel passages, but is fully established, partly by &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, the third day, and partly by the Arabic usage (vid., Ges. Thes. s. v.). &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; after &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;, lit., "go violently down," is more striking still. Nevertheless the correctness of the text is not to be called in question, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468; is sustained by &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; in the Septuagint, and &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491; by descende ergo festinus in the Vulgate, and also by the rendering in the Chaldee, Arabic, and Syriac versions, "and on the third day thou wilt be missed still more," which is evidently merely a conjecture founded upon the context. The meaning of &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is doubtful. Gesenius, De Wette, and Maurer render it "on the day of the deed," and understand it as referring to Saul's deed mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-2.htm">1 Samuel 19:2</a>, viz., his design of killing David; others render it "on the day of business," i.e., the working day (Luther, after the lxx and Vulgate), but this is not so good a rendering. The best is probably that of Thenius, "on the day of the business" (which is known to thee). Nothing further can be said concerning the stone Ezel than that Ezel is a proper name.</body></html>
