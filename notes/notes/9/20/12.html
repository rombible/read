It will be kindness to ourselves and to ours, to secure an interest in those whom God favours, and to make his friends ours. True friendship rests on a firm basis, and is able to silence ambition, self-love, and undue regard for others. But who can fully understand the love of Jesus, who gave himself as a sacrifice for rebellious, polluted sinners! how great then ought to be the force and effects of our love to him, to his cause, and his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The new moon, or beginning of each month, was celebrated with especial sacrifices and blowing of trumpets (marginal references.)

Their Covenant Renewed by Oath.<p>11. Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go into the field&#8212;The private dialogue, which is here detailed at full length, presents a most beautiful exhibition of these two amiable and noble-minded friends. Jonathan was led, in the circumstances, to be the chief speaker. The strength of his attachment, his pure disinterestedness, his warm piety, his invocation to God (consisting of a prayer and a solemn oath combined), the calm and full expression he gave of his conviction that his own family were, by the divine will, to be disinherited, and David elevated to the possession of the throne, the covenant entered into with David on behalf of his descendants, and the imprecation (1Sa 20:16) denounced on any of them who should violate his part of the conditions, the reiteration of this covenant on both sides (1Sa 20:17) to make it indissoluble&#8212;all this indicates such a power of mutual affection, such magnetic attractiveness in the character of David, such susceptibility and elevation of feeling in the heart of Jonathan, that this interview for dramatic interest and moral beauty stands unrivalled in the records of human friendship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">O Lord God of Israel, </span> do thou hear and judge between us.

This ground of excuse shows that families and households were accustomed to keep united sacrificial feasts once a year. According to the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>., they ought to have been kept at the tabernacle; but at this time, when the central sanctuary had fallen into disuse, they were held in different places, wherever there were altars of Jehovah - as, for example, at Bethlehem (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2</a>.). We see from these words that David did not look upon prevarication as a sin.</body></html>
