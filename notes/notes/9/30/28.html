Ezri, the son of Shemei the Ramathite, Zabdi the Shiphmite, and many others, were among the friends of his youth.” Eshtemoa, a priestly city, still survives, with ruins still visible, in the village of <span class= "ital">Semna.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:21-31 What God gives us, he designs we should do good with.
