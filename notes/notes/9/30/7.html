Through all his wanderings we hear, however, nothing of prayer and of consultation of the Urim. As regards the unfortunate Philistine sojourn, David seems to have determined upon that step entirely of himself; distrustful and despairing, he had fled the country, and taken refuge with the enemies of his people. One unbroken series of sin and calamity was the result ha sees of his fatal error.<p><span class= "bld">And Abiathar brought thither the ephod.</span>—Modern commentators, as a rule, prefer to disbelieve in any response coming through the medium of the Urim in the ephod. They either pass over the whole transaction in silence, or assume that some Divine inspiration came to the high priest when vested with the sacred garment. The plain meaning, however, of the frequent references tells us in some way or other the Divine will was made known through the agency of the mysterious Urim and Thummim. See, for instance, in the case of Saul, where definitely it is stated that the Lord answered him not “by Urim” (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm" title="And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.">1Samuel 28:6</a>), where this peculiar Divine response is carefully distinguished from the manifestation of the will of God in a dream or a vision, or through the Divine instrumentality of the prophet or seer. The ancient Hebrews had no hesitation in attributing to the sacred precious stones an occasional special power of declaring the oracles of God. The Talmudical traditions are clear and decisive here. Now, without attaching anything like an implicit credence to these most ancient Hebrew traditions—many of them fanciful and wild, many of them written in a cryptograph, or secret cypher, to which Christians in most cases do not possess the key—it does seem in the highest degree arbitrary to reject the ancient traditional belief of the Hebrew race contained in the Talmud with respect to this most mysterious ephod and its sacred gems, and to adopt another interpretation, which fits in very lamely with the plain text. The whole question respecting the traditions of the Urim and Thummim is discussed at some length in the short <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>M on the Urini, at the end of this Commentary on the First Book of Samuel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod.

David, in tenderness to his men, would by no means urge them beyond their strength. The Son of David thus considers the frames of his followers, who are not all alike strong and vigorous in their spiritual pursuits and conflicts; but, where we are weak, there he is kind; nay more, there he is strong, 2Co 12:9,10. A poor Egyptian lad, scarcely alive, is made the means of a great deal of good to David. Justly did Providence make this poor servant, who was basely used by his master, an instrument in the destruction of the Amalekites; for God hears the cry of the oppressed. Those are unworthy the name of true Israelites, who shut up their compassion from persons in distress. We should neither do an injury nor deny a kindness to any man; some time or other it may be in the power of the lowest to return a kindness or an injury.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abiathar had continued to abide with David, ever since he joined him at Keilah <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>.

In strong contrast to the silence which surrounds Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>), the answer is most encouraging. Literally it is, "Pursue; for overtaking thou shalt overtake, and delivering thou shalt deliver." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-4</a> form one period, which is expanded by the introduction of several circumstantial clauses. The apodosis to "It came to pass, when," etc. (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), does not follow till <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-4.htm">1 Samuel 30:4</a>, "Then David and the people," etc. But this is formally attached to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3</a>, "so David and his men came," with which the protasis commenced in <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a> is resumed in an altered form. "It came to pass, when David and his men came to Ziklag ... the Amalekites had invaded ... and had carried off the wives ... and had gone their way, and David and his men came into the town (for 'when David and his men came,' etc.), and behold it was burned ... . Then David and the people with him lifted up their voice." "On the third day:" after David's dismission by Achish, not after David's departure from Ziklag. David had at any rate gone with Achish beyond Gath, and had not been sent back till the whole of the princes of the Philistines had united their armies (<a href="/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a>.), so that he must have been absent from Ziklag more than two days, or two days and a half. This is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="/1_samuel/30-11.htm">1 Samuel 30:11</a>., since the Amalekites are there described as having gone off with their booty three days before David followed them, and therefore they had taken Ziklag and burned it three days before David's return. These foes had therefore taken advantage of the absence of David and his warriors, to avenge themselves for David's invasions and plunderings (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>). Of those who were carried off, "the women" alone expressly mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-2.htm">1 Samuel 30:2</a>, although the female population and all the children had been removed, as we may see from the expression "small and great" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>). The lxx were therefore correct, so far as the sense is concerned, in introducing the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. "They had killed no one, but (only) carried away." &#1504;&#1492;&#1490;, to carry away captive, as in <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>. Among those who had been carried off were David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42-43</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>).</body></html>
