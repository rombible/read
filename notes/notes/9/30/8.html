David, in tenderness to his men, would by no means urge them beyond their strength. The Son of David thus considers the frames of his followers, who are not all alike strong and vigorous in their spiritual pursuits and conflicts; but, where we are weak, there he is kind; nay more, there he is strong, 2Co 12:9,10. A poor Egyptian lad, scarcely alive, is made the means of a great deal of good to David. Justly did Providence make this poor servant, who was basely used by his master, an instrument in the destruction of the Amalekites; for God hears the cry of the oppressed. Those are unworthy the name of true Israelites, who shut up their compassion from persons in distress. We should neither do an injury nor deny a kindness to any man; some time or other it may be in the power of the lowest to return a kindness or an injury.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abiathar had continued to abide with David, ever since he joined him at Keilah <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>.

The apodosis to "It came to pass, when," etc. (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), does not follow till <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-4.htm">1 Samuel 30:4</a>, "Then David and the people," etc. But this is formally attached to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3</a>, "so David and his men came," with which the protasis commenced in <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a> is resumed in an altered form. "It came to pass, when David and his men came to Ziklag ... the Amalekites had invaded ... and had carried off the wives ... and had gone their way, and David and his men came into the town (for 'when David and his men came,' etc.), and behold it was burned ... . Then David and the people with him lifted up their voice." "On the third day:" after David's dismission by Achish, not after David's departure from Ziklag. David had at any rate gone with Achish beyond Gath, and had not been sent back till the whole of the princes of the Philistines had united their armies (<a href="/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a>.), so that he must have been absent from Ziklag more than two days, or two days and a half. This is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="/1_samuel/30-11.htm">1 Samuel 30:11</a>., since the Amalekites are there described as having gone off with their booty three days before David followed them, and therefore they had taken Ziklag and burned it three days before David's return. These foes had therefore taken advantage of the absence of David and his warriors, to avenge themselves for David's invasions and plunderings (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>). Of those who were carried off, "the women" alone expressly mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-2.htm">1 Samuel 30:2</a>, although the female population and all the children had been removed, as we may see from the expression "small and great" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>). The lxx were therefore correct, so far as the sense is concerned, in introducing the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. "They had killed no one, but (only) carried away." &#1504;&#1492;&#1490;, to carry away captive, as in <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>. Among those who had been carried off were David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42-43</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>).</body></html>
