It may well be conceived there was no time to lose. The cruelty of the Amalekites to their slaves was the cause of their ultimate discomfiture, for with the very considerable start they already had, if David had not been quite certain, through the information of the Egyptian, of their route, the pursuit would have been utterly hopeless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/30-12.htm" title="And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights....">1 Samuel 30:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Three days and nights — </span>One whole day, and part of two others, as appears from the next verse, where he says, <span class="ital">Three days ago I fell sick; </span>but in the Hebrew it is, <span class="ital">This is the third day since I fell sick.

But this inhumanity cost them dear; for, through it, they lost their own lives, and David recovered what they had taken at Ziklag. Such is the wonderful providence of God, ordering or overruling every thing for his own glory and the good of those that trust in him, even the thoughts and desires, the counsels, works, and ways of men, both the good and the bad!

David, in tenderness to his men, would by no means urge them beyond their strength. The Son of David thus considers the frames of his followers, who are not all alike strong and vigorous in their spiritual pursuits and conflicts; but, where we are weak, there he is kind; nay more, there he is strong, 2Co 12:9,10. A poor Egyptian lad, scarcely alive, is made the means of a great deal of good to David. Justly did Providence make this poor servant, who was basely used by his master, an instrument in the destruction of the Amalekites; for God hears the cry of the oppressed. Those are unworthy the name of true Israelites, who shut up their compassion from persons in distress. We should neither do an injury nor deny a kindness to any man; some time or other it may be in the power of the lowest to return a kindness or an injury.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Three days and three nights - Indicating that at least so long a time had elapsed since the sack of Ziklag. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-15. they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David&#8212;Old and homeborn slaves are usually treated with great kindness. But a purchased or captured slave must look to himself; for, if feeble or sick, his master will leave him to perish rather than encumber himself with any additional burden. This Egyptian seems to have recently fallen into the hands of an Amalekite, and his master having belonged to the marauding party that had made the attack on Ziklag, he could give useful information as to the course taken by them on their return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which is to be understood synecdochically of one whole day, and part of two others, as the same phrase is taken <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a></span>, as appears from the next verse, where he saith, <span class="ital">three days agone I fell sick</span>, but in the Hebrew it <span class="ital">this is the third day since I fell sick</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they gave him a piece of cake of figs,....

"For the soul of the whole people was embittered (i.e., all the people were embittered in their souls) because of their sons and daughters," who had been carried away into slavery. "But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God," i.e., sought consolation and strength in prayer and believing confidence in the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>.). This strength he manifested in the resolution to follow the foes and rescue their booty from them. To this end he had the ephod brought by the high priest Abiathar (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>), and inquired by means of the Urim of the Lord, "Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake it?" These questions were answered in the affirmative; and the promise was added, "and thou wilt rescue." So David pursued the enemy with his six hundred men as far as the brook Besor, where the rest, i.e., two hundred, remained standing (stayed behind). The words &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which are appended in the form of a circumstantial clause, are to be connected, so far as the facts are concerned, with what follows: whilst the others remained behind, David pursued the enemy still farther with four hundred men. By the word &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the historian has somewhat anticipated the matter, and therefore regards it as necessary to define the expression still further in <a href="/1_samuel/30-10.htm">1 Samuel 30:10</a>. We are precluded from changing the text, as Thenius suggests, by the circumstance that all the early translators read it in this manner, and have endeavoured to make the expression intelligible by paraphrasing it. These two hundred men were too tired to cross the brook and go any farther. (&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;, which only occurs here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-21.htm">1 Samuel 30:21</a>, signifies, in Syriac, to be weary or exhausted.) As Ziklag was burnt down, of course they found no provisions there, and were consequently obliged to set out in pursuit of the foe without being able to provide themselves with the necessary supplies. The brook Besor is supposed to be the Wady Sheriah, which enters the sea below Ashkelon (see v. Raumer, Pal. p. 52). </body></html>
