The “six hundred” by no means represented his present force; but these were probably the old band of veteran soldiers, whose speed and endurance he could depend upon—men tried, no doubt, by many a weary night march, by many a rough, wild piece of work. A large contingent even of these veterans could not stand the forced march of their leader on this occasion.<p>In the words “for two hundred abode behind,” the narrator anticipated what is told in <a href="/1_samuel/30-10.htm" title="But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.">1Samuel 30:10</a>. It is a proleptical expression, arising from the vivacious description of David’s rapid march with four hundred men (<span class= "ital">Lange</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The Vulg. paraphrases, or rather seeks to amend the text here: “and certain tired ones stayed.” The Syriac changes the text into “David left two hundred men;” these men who had fallen out of the rapid march were gathered together, and kept the baggage and everything that could be left behind at the encampment at the brook Besor. It is to be supposed that owing to the hurried departure, but scanty provision for the forced march was made, hence the falling out through weariness in the course of the rapid advance. The brook Besor cannot be identified with certainty; and Raumer (<span class= "ital">Palestine</span>) supposes it to be the Wady Shariah, which falls into the sea below Askelon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/30-9.htm" title="So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed....">1 Samuel 30:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Where those that were left behind stayed — </span>Those that were left to look after the stuff, <a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm" title="For who will listen to you in this matter? but as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike.">1 Samuel 30:24</a>; who were so tired, that they were not able to march any further. <span class="ital">David pursued, he and four hundred men — </span>A small number for such an attempt; but David was strong in faith, giving God the glory of his power and faithfulness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:7-15 If in all our ways, even when, as in this case, there can be no doubt they are just, we acknowledge God, we may expect that he will direct our steps, as he did those of David. David, in tenderness to his men, would by no means urge them beyond their strength. The Son of David thus considers the frames of his followers, who are not all alike strong and vigorous in their spiritual pursuits and conflicts; but, where we are weak, there he is kind; nay more, there he is strong, 2Co 12:9,10. A poor Egyptian lad, scarcely alive, is made the means of a great deal of good to David. Justly did Providence make this poor servant, who was basely used by his master, an instrument in the destruction of the Amalekites; for God hears the cry of the oppressed. Those are unworthy the name of true Israelites, who shut up their compassion from persons in distress. We should neither do an injury nor deny a kindness to any man; some time or other it may be in the power of the lowest to return a kindness or an injury.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Besor - Thought to be the stream of the Wady Sheriah which enters the sea a little south of Gaza. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. came to the brook Besor&#8212;now Wady Gaza, a winter torrent, a little to the south of Gaza.

Cp. <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm" title="And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.">1 Samuel 27:2</a>.

The brook Besor is mentioned here only, and has not been identified with certainty. Perhaps it was the <span class="ital">Wady es Sherîah</span>, which runs down to the sea a few miles south of Gaza.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - Having obtained this favourable answer, David starts in pursuit with his old band of 600 men. So rapid was his march that one third of these dropped out of the ranks, so that the newcomers from Manasseh would have been useless, nor had they lost wives or children. The <span class="cmt_word">brook</span> (or rather "torrent") <span class="cmt_word">Besor</span> practically remains unidentified, as the site of Ziklag is unknown; but possibly it is the Wady-es-Sheriah, which runs into the sea a little to the south of Gaza. As there was water here, <span class="cmt_word">those that were left behind stayed.</span> Hebrew, "the stragglers stayed." It seems also to have been wide enough to cause some difficulty in crossing, as it is said that these 200 were too faint, or tired, <span class="cmt_word">to go over the</span> torrent <span class="cmt_word">Besor</span>. From ver. 24 we find that David also left with them as much as possible of his baggage. Stragglers had no doubt been falling out for some time, but would here be rallied, and obtain rest and refreshment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-4</a> form one period, which is expanded by the introduction of several circumstantial clauses. The apodosis to "It came to pass, when," etc. (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), does not follow till <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-4.htm">1 Samuel 30:4</a>, "Then David and the people," etc. But this is formally attached to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3</a>, "so David and his men came," with which the protasis commenced in <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a> is resumed in an altered form. "It came to pass, when David and his men came to Ziklag ... the Amalekites had invaded ... and had carried off the wives ... and had gone their way, and David and his men came into the town (for 'when David and his men came,' etc.), and behold it was burned ... . Then David and the people with him lifted up their voice." "On the third day:" after David's dismission by Achish, not after David's departure from Ziklag. David had at any rate gone with Achish beyond Gath, and had not been sent back till the whole of the princes of the Philistines had united their armies (<a href="/1_samuel/29-2.htm">1 Samuel 29:2</a>.), so that he must have been absent from Ziklag more than two days, or two days and a half. This is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="/1_samuel/30-11.htm">1 Samuel 30:11</a>., since the Amalekites are there described as having gone off with their booty three days before David followed them, and therefore they had taken Ziklag and burned it three days before David's return. These foes had therefore taken advantage of the absence of David and his warriors, to avenge themselves for David's invasions and plunderings (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>). Of those who were carried off, "the women" alone expressly mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-2.htm">1 Samuel 30:2</a>, although the female population and all the children had been removed, as we may see from the expression "small and great" (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm">1 Samuel 30:3</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>). The lxx were therefore correct, so far as the sense is concerned, in introducing the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;. "They had killed no one, but (only) carried away." &#1504;&#1492;&#1490;, to carry away captive, as in <a href="/isaiah/20-4.htm">Isaiah 20:4</a>. Among those who had been carried off were David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42-43</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>).</body></html>
