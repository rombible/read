The burnt offering of the kine was not in any sense the offering of the men of Bethshemesh, but rather of the Philistine lords to whom the cart and the kine belonged. But the Bethshemites themselves, in token of their gratitude for such a signal mercy, now offered both burnt offerings and sacrifices, probably peace offerings, and doubtless feasted together with great joy and gladness (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62-66</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-17</a>).

When the Philistines, in accordance with the advice given them by their priests, had placed the ark of the covenant and the expiatory gifts upon the cart to which the two cows were harnessed, "the cows went straight forward on the way to Bethshemesh; they went along a road going and lowing (i.e., lowing the whole time), and turned not to the right or to the left; and the princes of the Philistines went behind them to the territory of Bethshemesh." &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, lit., "they were straight in the way," i.e., they went straight along the road.

Bethshemesh, the present Ain-shems, was a priests' city on the border of Judah and Dan (see at <a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>). </body></html>
