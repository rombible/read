God's providence takes notice even of brute creatures, and serves its own purposes by them. When the reapers saw the ark, they rejoiced; their joy for that was greater than the joy of harvest.

The burnt offering of the kine was not in any sense the offering of the men of Bethshemesh, but rather of the Philistine lords to whom the cart and the kine belonged. But the Bethshemites themselves, in token of their gratitude for such a signal mercy, now offered both burnt offerings and sacrifices, probably peace offerings, and doubtless feasted together with great joy and gladness (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62-66</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-17</a>).

Apparently it was only after the sacrificial feast that they forgot the reverence due to the symbol of Jehovah's presence among them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Accordingly they arranged the sending back in such a manner as to manifest the reverence which ought to be shown to the God of Israel was a powerful deity (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7-9</a>). The Philistines were to take a new cart and make it ready (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;), and to yoke two milch cows to the cart upon which no yoke had ever come, and to take away their young ones (calves) from them into the house, i.e., into the stall, and then to put the ark upon the cart, along with the golden things to be presented as a trespass-offering, which were to be in a small chest by the side of the ark, and to send it (i.e., the ark) away, that it might go, viz., without the cows being either driven or guided. From the result of these arrangements, they were to learn whether the plague had been sent by the God of Israel, or had arisen accidentally. "If it (the ark) goeth up by the way to its border towards Bethshemesh, He (Jehovah) hath done us this great evil; but if not, we perceive that His hand hath not touched us. It came to us by chance," i.e., the evil came upon us merely by accident. In &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, and &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a>), the masculine is used in the place of the more definite feminine, as being the more general form. This is frequently the case, and occurs again in <a href="/1_samuel/6-10.htm">1 Samuel 6:10</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1494;, which only occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-8.htm">1 Samuel 6:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-11.htm">1 Samuel 6:11</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a>, signifies, according to the context and the ancient versions, a chest or little case. The suffix to &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; refers to the ark, which is also the subject to &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; (<a href="/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>). &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;, the territory of the ark, is the land of Israel, where it had its home. &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; is used adverbially: by chance, or accidentally. The new cart and the young cows, which had never worn a yoke, corresponded to the holiness of the ark of God. To place it upon an old cart, which had already been used for all kinds of earthly purposes, would have been an offence against the holy thing; and it would have been just the same to yoke to the cart animals that had already been used for drawing, and had had their strength impaired by the yoke (see <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>). The reason for selecting cows, however, instead of male oxen, was no doubt to be found in the further object which they hoped to attain. It was certainly to be expected, that if suckling cows, whose calves had been kept back from them, followed their own instincts, without any drivers, they would not go away, but would come back to their young ones in the stall. And if the very opposite should take place, this would be a sure sign that they were driven and guided by a divine power, and in fact by the God whose ark they were to draw into His own land. From this they would be able to draw the conclusion, that the plagues which had fallen upon the Philistines were also sent by this God. There was no special sagacity in this advice of the priests; it was nothing more than a cleverly devised attempt to put the power of the God of the Israelites to the text, though they thereby unconsciously and against their will furnished the occasion for the living God to display His divine glory before those who did not know Him. </body></html>
