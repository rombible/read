Man was ruined by desiring forbidden knowledge. God will not suffer his ark to be profaned. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. Those that will not fear his goodness, and reverently use the tokens of his grace, shall be made to feel his justice. The number smitten is expressed in an unusual manner in the original, and it is probable that it means 1170. They desire to be rid of the ark. Foolish men run from one extreme to the other. They should rather have asked, How may we have peace with God, and recover his favor? Mic 6:6,7. Thus, when the word of God works with terror on sinners' consciences, they, instead of taking the blame and shame to themselves, quarrel with the word, and put that from them.

This was the nearest town to Beth-shemesh; and being a place of strength, it was a more fitting place for the residence of the ark. Beth-shemesh being in a low plain, and Kirjath-jearim on a hill, explains the message, "Come ye down, and fetch it up to you."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They sent to Kirjath-jearim, either because the place was not far from them, and so it might soon be removed, which they mainly desired; or because it was a place of eminency and strength, and somewhat further distant from the Philistines, where therefore it was likely to be better preserved from any new attempts of the Philistines, and to be better attended by the Israelites, who would more freely and frequently come to it at such a place, than in Beth-shemesh, which was upon the border of their enemies’ land; or because they thought they would gladly receive it, being a pious and zealous people; or because it was in the way to Shiloh, its ancient habitation, and whither they might suppose it was to be carried by degrees and several stages, whereof this was one. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,....

Kirjathjearim seems to have stood on an eminence in comparison of Bethshemesh, and therefore it is said to come down from the one, and go up to the other.

After sacrificing the cart, with the cows, as a burnt-offering to the Lord, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh gave a further practical expression to their joy at the return of the ark, by offering burnt-offerings and slain-offerings in praise of God. In the burnt-offerings they consecrated themselves afresh, with all their members, to the service of the Lord; and in the slain-offerings, which culminated in the sacrificial meals, they sealed anew their living fellowship with the Lord. The offering of these sacrifices at Bethshemesh was no offence against the commandment, to sacrifice to the Lord at the place of His sanctuary alone. The ark of the covenant was the throne of the gracious presence of God, before which the sacrifices were really offered at the tabernacle. The Lord had sanctified the ark afresh as the throne of His presence, by the miracle which He had wrought in bringing it back again. - In <a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a> the different atoning presents, which the Philistines sent to Jehovah as compensation, are enumerated once more: viz., five golden boils, one for each of their five principal towns (see at <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>), and "golden mice, according to the number of all the Philistian towns of the five princes, from the fortified city to the village of the inhabitants of the level land" (perazi; see at <a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>). The priests had only proposed that five golden mice should be sent as compensation, as well as five boils (<a href="/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4</a>). But the Philistines offered as many images of mice as there were towns and villages in their five states, no doubt because the plague of mice had spread over the whole land, whereas the plague of boils had only fallen upon the inhabitants of those towns to which the ark of the covenant had come. In this way the apparent discrepancy between <a href="/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a> is very simply removed. The words which follow, viz., &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "upon which they had set down the ark," show unmistakeably, when compared with <a href="/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a>, that we are to understand by &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1488;&#1489;&#1500; the great stone upon which the ark was placed when it was taken off the cart. The conjecture of Kimchi, that this stone was called Abel (luctus), on account of the mourning which took place there (see <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>), is extremely unnatural. Consequently there is no other course left than to regard &#1488;&#1489;&#1500; as an error in writing for &#1488;&#1489;&#1503;, according to the reading, or at all events the rendering, adopted by the lxx and Targum. But &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; (even unto) is quite unsuitable here, as no further local definition is required after the foregoing &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1512; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, and it is impossible to suppose that the Philistines offered a golden mouse as a trespass-offering for the great stone upon which the ark was placed. We must therefore alter &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; into &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;: "And the great stone is witness (for &#1493;&#1506;&#1491; in this sense, see <a href="/genesis/31-52.htm">Genesis 31:52</a>) to this day in the field of Joshua the Bethshemeshite," sc., of the fact just described. </body></html>
