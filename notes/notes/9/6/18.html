They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.">1Samuel 6:4</a>). The truth was that whilst the human sickness was confined to the five cities, the plague of field mice no doubt extended over the whole country. The inhabitants of all the villages were anxious to do their part to propitiate the insulted Hebrew God, and to get rid of the plague which was devastating their fields and vineyards; hence this large offering, so much in excess of what was suggested by the diviners.<p><span class= "bld">The great stone of Abel.</span>—The LXX. Version reads here, “And this great stone on which they placed the Ark of Jehovah, which is in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, is a witness unto this day.” With this reading the Chaldee Targum substantially agrees. The Hebrew text here is hopelessly corrupt; the copies which the Greek translators and the Chaldee Targumist apparently had before them, instead of the word “Avel” (Abel), which signifies mourning, read the word <span class= "ital">ăven, </span>a stone, and the punctuation of <span class= "ital">v’ad, </span>“and unto,” in the last clause was evidently (<span class= "ital">v’ed</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>“and a witness.” If the reading Avel be the true one (“even unto the great Avel”), then the conjecture of R. D. Kimchi is probably right, that this stone was known as the Great Avel (or Abel), “the great mourning,” owing to the terrible judicial calamity, related in the next three verses (<a href="/context/1_samuel/6-19.htm" title="And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.">1Samuel 6:19-21</a>), which happened there. With this slight change a very good sense is obtained.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm" title="And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even to the great stone of Abel, where on they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.">1 Samuel 6:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Both of fenced cities and country villages — </span>This is added, either to show, that under the name of the five cities were comprehended all the villages and territories belonging to them, in whose name, and at whose charge, these presents were made; or to express the difference between this and the former present, the emerods being only five, according to the five cities mentioned <a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;">1 Samuel 6:17</a>; the cities, perhaps, being chiefly afflicted with that disorder; and the mice being many more, according <span class="ital">to the number of all the cities and villages, </span>as here expressed. <span class="ital">Abel — </span>This is mentioned as the utmost border of the Philistines’ territory, to which the plague of mice extended.

The Vulgate Latin version is unto great Abel, taking it for a city, as does Procopius Gazaeus, who calls it the great city Abel, through which they carried the ark of the Lord; so Jerom (y), who takes it to be the same with Bethshemesh, called Abel because of the mourning in it for the men of Bethshemesh after slain; or to distinguish it from another Abel is called "great", <a href="/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a> but it seems plainly to be the same with the great stone, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-14.htm">1 Samuel 6:14</a>, here called Eben Gedolah, here Abel Gedolah, by the change of a letter, having its latter name by anticipation from the great mourning hereafter made, next mentioned: <p>whereon they set down the ark of the Lord; when it was taken out of the cart, as also the coffer in which were the presents, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a>, <p>which: stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Bethshemite: the supplement, which stone remaineth, seems necessary, lest it should be thought the ark remained there unto the time of the writing this book, which was not true, for it was soon after this fetched to Kirjathjearim; but the stone remained, and might be seen; and posterity in following times were told that was the stone on which the ark was put when it returned to Israel. <p>(y) Trad.

When the Philistines, in accordance with the advice given them by their priests, had placed the ark of the covenant and the expiatory gifts upon the cart to which the two cows were harnessed, "the cows went straight forward on the way to Bethshemesh; they went along a road going and lowing (i.e., lowing the whole time), and turned not to the right or to the left; and the princes of the Philistines went behind them to the territory of Bethshemesh." &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492;, lit., "they were straight in the way," i.e., they went straight along the road.
