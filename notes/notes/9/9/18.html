Both that evening and early the next morning, Samuel communed with Saul upon the flat roof of the house. We may suppose Samuel now convinced Saul that he was the person God had fixed upon for the government, and of his own willingness to resign. How different are the purposes of the Lord for us, from our intentions for ourselves! Perhaps Saul was the only one who ever went out to seek asses, and literally found a kingdom; but many have set out and moved their dwellings to seek riches and pleasures, who have been guided to places where they found salvation for their souls. Thus they have met with those who addressed them as if aware of the secrets of their lives and hearts, and have been led seriously to regard the word of the Lord. If this has been our case, though our worldly plans have not prospered, let us not care for that; the Lord has given us, or has prepared us for, what is far better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, etc. - These words are not very easily reconcileable with <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>. It is possible that the aggressive movements of the Philistines, after the long cessation indicated by <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>, coupled with Samuel's old age and consequent inability to lead them to victory as before, were among the chief causes which led to the cry for a king. If this were so the Philistine oppression glanced at in this verse might in a general survey be rather connected with Saul's times than with Samuel's. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-20.

Either at the door of his own house, just as he was coming out of it, or within the gate of the city as Saul entered that, Samuel came to it, in order to go through it to the high place, which it is probable was without the city; wherefore it is very properly said that Samuel came out to meet them, <a href="/1_samuel/9-14.htm">1 Samuel 9:14</a>. <p>and said, tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is; one knows not which to wonder at most, the simplicity and humility of Samuel to be in so plain an habit, unattended by servants, and yet going to a public festival, so that he seemed to be no other than a common man, to be inquired of whereabout his house was; or the ignorance of Saul, who had lived so long in the world, and so near Samuel, and yet had never seen and knew not the chief magistrate in the nation, so famous both for his civil and religious character. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">in the gate</span>] Heb. “<span class="bld">In the midst</span> of the gate,” i.e. the gateway, where they would naturally halt to inquire for the Seer’s house.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the gate.</span> The same preposition is used here as that translated "into the city" in ver. 14.

Bamah (in the singular) does not mean the height or hill generally; but throughout it signifies the high place, as a place of sacrifice or prayer. </body></html>
