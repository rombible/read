Both that evening and early the next morning, Samuel communed with Saul upon the flat roof of the house. We may suppose Samuel now convinced Saul that he was the person God had fixed upon for the government, and of his own willingness to resign. How different are the purposes of the Lord for us, from our intentions for ourselves! Perhaps Saul was the only one who ever went out to seek asses, and literally found a kingdom; but many have set out and moved their dwellings to seek riches and pleasures, who have been guided to places where they found salvation for their souls. Thus they have met with those who addressed them as if aware of the secrets of their lives and hearts, and have been led seriously to regard the word of the Lord. If this has been our case, though our worldly plans have not prospered, let us not care for that; the Lord has given us, or has prepared us for, what is far better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tribe of Benjamin, originally the smallest of all the tribes <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/1-36.htm">Numbers 1:36</a>, if Ephraim and Manasseh are reckoned as one tribe, had been nearly annihilated by the civil war recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>.

Benjamin, already the smallest tribe, had been so crushed that its power must have been very small, and Soul's house, though opulent, was not a leading one; how then could one of its members expect so high a dignity? For <span class="cmt_word">families of the tribe of Benjamin</span> the Hebrew has "tribes," probably owing to some confusion with the words "tribes of Israel" just before. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they went into the town, Samuel met them on his way out to go to the high place of sacrifice. Before the meeting itself is described, the statement is introduced in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-15.htm">1 Samuel 9:15-17</a>, that the day before Jehovah had foretold to Samuel that the man was coming to him whom he was to anoint as captain over his people. &#1488;&#1494;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, to open any one's ear, equivalent to reveal something to him (<a href="/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-27.htm">2 Samuel 7:27</a>, etc.). &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, I will send thee, i.e., "I will so direct his way in my overruling providence, that he shall come to thee" (J. H. Mich. ). The words, "that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, for their cry is come unto me," are not at all at variance with <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>. In that passage there is simply the assertion, that there was no more any permanent oppression on the part of the Philistines in the days of Samuel, such as had taken place before; but an attempt to recover their supremacy over Israel is not only not precluded, but is even indirectly affirmed (see the comm. on <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>). The words before us simply show that the Philistines had then begun to make a fresh attempt to contend for dominion over the Israelites. "I have looked upon my people:" this is to be explained like the similar passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/2-25.htm">Exodus 2:25</a>, "God looked upon the children of Israel," and <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, "I have looked upon the misery of my people." God's looking was not a quiet, inactive looking on, but an energetic look, which brought help in trouble. "Their cry is come unto me:" this is word for word the same as in <a href="/exodus/3-9.htm">Exodus 3:9</a>. As the Philistines wanted to tread in the footsteps of the Egyptians, it was necessary that Jehovah should also send His people a deliverer from these new oppressors, by giving them a king. The reason here assigned for the establishment of a monarchy is by no means at variance with the displeasure which God had expressed to Samuel at the desire of the people for a king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>.); since this displeasure had reference to the state of heart from which the desire had sprung. </body></html>
