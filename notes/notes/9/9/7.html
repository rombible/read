Compare, for instance, the many detailed accounts of presents offered and accepted, chronicled in the varied sacred records—such as the little present of spicery, &c, sent by Jacob to the great minister or vizier of the Pharaoh of Egypt (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>), and the ten cheeses Jesse gave to the captain of the thousand in which his sons were serving, and in the days of the highest civilisation and culture known in Israel, the gifts offered by the Queen of Sheba to the magnificent Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-10.htm" title="And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.">1Kings 10:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/9-7.htm" title="Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?...">1 Samuel 9:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man — </span>It was a part of the honour they did great men, in those countries, to make them a present when they had occasion to address themselves to them.

His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Presents of bread or meat were as common as presents of money.

The Targum is,"if he receives money,''which it seems Saul was not clear in; some sort of persons that set up for prophets, and a sort of diviners and fortune tellers, did; but he could not tell whether so eminent and honourable a person as Samuel was, did; in as much he was not better known by him, who had been so many years a judge in Israel: <p>what shall we bring the man? it being usual, when persons addressed great men for a favour, to carry a present with them; or a man of God, a prophet of the Lord, to inquire of the Lord by him concerning any thing, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/14-2.htm">1 Kings 14:2</a>, <p>for the bread is spent in our vessels; the food they brought with them in their bags or scrips for their journey, this was all exhausted; not that he meant by it, that if they had had any quantity, they might present it to the man of God, though yet sometimes such things were done, as the instances before referred to show; but that since their stock of bread was gone, what money they had, if they had any, must be spent in recruiting themselves, and therefore could have none to spare to give to the man: <p>and there is not a present to bring to the man of God; neither bread nor money, without which he seems to intimate it would be to no purpose to go to him: <p>what have we? Saul knew he had none, he had spent what he brought out, with him for the journey, and he put this question to try what his servant had; unless it can be supposed it was the custom now, as afterwards among the Romans (b), for servants to carry the purse, and as it was with the Jews in Christ's time, <a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a> though this may have respect not to a price of divination, but to the common custom in eastern countries, and which continues to this day with the Turks, who reckon it uncivil to visit any person, whether in authority, or an inferior person, without a present; and even the latter are seldom visited without presenting a flower, or an orange, and some token of respect to the person visited (c). <p>(b) A.

The elaborate genealogy of the Benjaminite Kish, and the minute description of the figure of his son Saul, are intended to indicate at the very outset the importance to which Saul attained in relation to the people of Israel, Kish was the son of Abiel: this is in harmony with <a href="/1_samuel/14-51.htm">1 Samuel 14:51</a>. But when, on the other hand, it is stated in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-39.htm">1 Chronicles 9:39</a>, that Ner begat Kish, the difference may be reconciled in the simplest manner, on the assumption that the Ner mentioned there is not the father, but the grandfather, or a still more remote ancestor of Kish, as the intervening members are frequently passed over in the genealogies. The other ancestors of Kish are never mentioned again. &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; refers to Kish, and signifies not a brave man, but a man of property, as in <a href="/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>. This son Saul (i.e., "prayed for:" for this meaning of the word, comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-17.htm">1 Samuel 1:17</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/1-27.htm">1 Samuel 1:27</a>) was "young and beautiful." It is true that even at that time Saul had a son grown up (viz., Jonathan), according to <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>; but still, in contrast with his father, he was "a young man," i.e., in the full vigour of youth, probably about forty or forty-five years old. There is no necessity, therefore, to follow the Vulgate rendering electus. No one equalled him in beauty. "From his shoulder upwards he was higher than any of the people." Such a figure as this was well adapted to commend him to the people as their king (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>), since size and beauty were highly valued in rulers, as signs of manly strength (see Herod. iii. 20, vii. 187; Aristot. Polit. iv. c. 24).</body></html>
