Still, the impression which the narrative leaves on the mind is that it was Samuel’s usual residence—“Ramah.” We know Samuel had built an altar to the Lord at Ramah (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm" title="And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:17</a>); on the day of Saul’s arrival there was a great sacrifice taking place on the altar of the high place of the city. Again, in this nameless city the seer had a house of his own (see <a href="/1_samuel/9-18.htm" title="Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.">1Samuel 9:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-25.htm" title="And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul on the top of the house.">1Samuel 9:25</a>).

His obedience to his father was praise-worthy. His servant proposed, that since they were now at Ramah, they should call on Samuel, and take his advice. Wherever we are, we should use our opportunities of acquainting ourselves with those who are wise and good. Many will consult a man of God, if he comes in their way, that would not go a step out of their way to get wisdom. We sensibly feel worldly losses, and bestow much pains to make them up; but how little do we attempt, and how soon are we weary, in seeking the salvation of our souls! If ministers could tell men how to secure their property, or to get wealth, they would be more consulted and honoured than they now are, though employed in teaching them how to escape eternal misery, and to obtain eternal life. Most people would rather be told their fortune than their duty. Samuel needed not their money, nor would he have denied his advice, if they had not brought it; but they gave it to him as a token of respect, and of the value they put upon his office, and according to the general usage of those times, always to bring a present to those in authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is manifestly a gloss inserted in the older narrative by the later editor of the sacred text, to explain the use of the term in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-11.htm">1 Samuel 9:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-18.htm">1 Samuel 9:18-19</a>.

Shalishah is unquestionably the country round (or of) Baal-shalishah (<a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>), which was situated, according to Eusebius (Onom. s.v. &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;: Beth-sarisa or Beth-salisa), in regione Thamnitica, fifteen Roman miles to the north of Diospolis (Lydda), and was therefore probably the country to the west of Jiljilia, where three different wadys run into one large wady, called Kurawa; and according to the probable conjecture of Thenius, it was from this fact that the district received the name of Shalishah, or Three-land. They proceeded thence in their search to the land of Shaalim: according to the Onom. (s.v.), "a village seven miles off, in finibus Eleutheropoleos contra occidentem." But this is hardly correct, and is most likely connected with the mistake made in transposing the town of Samuel to the neighbourhood of Diospolis (see at <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>). For since they went on from Shaalim into the land of Benjamin, and then still further into the land of Zuph, on the south-west of Benjamin, they probably turned eastwards from Shalishah, into the country where we find Beni Mussah and Beni Salem marked upon Robinson's and v. de Velde's maps, and where we must therefore look for the land of Shaalim, that they might proceed thence to explore the land of Benjamin from the north-east to the south-west. If, on the contrary, they had gone from Shaalim in a southerly or south-westerly direction, to the district of Eleutheropolis, they would only have entered the land of Benjamin at the south-west corner, and would have had to go all the way back again in order to go thence to the land of Zuph. For we may infer with certainty that the land of Zuph was on the south-west of the tribe-territory of Benjamin, from the fact that, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, Saul and his companion passed Rachel's tomb on their return thence to their own home, and then came to the border of Benjamin. On the name Zuph, see at <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>.</body></html>
