And we should always be ready to help those who are seeking after God's prophets.

Like the "house of the god Berith" <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a>, it was probably the citadel of Ramah. There was connected with the altar a room large enough for thirty people to dine in <a href="/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. as they went up the hill&#8212;The modern village, Er-Rameh, lies on an eminence; and on their way they met a band of young maidens going out to the well, which, like all similar places in Palestine, was beyond the precincts of the town. From these damsels they learned that the day was devoted to a festival occasion, in honor of which Samuel had arrived in the city; that a sacrifice had been offered, which was done by prophets in extraordinary circumstances at a distance from the tabernacle, and that a feast was to follow&#8212;implying that it had been a peace offering; and that, according to the venerable practice of the Israelites, the man of God was expected to ask a special blessing on the food in a manner becoming the high occasion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye shall straightway find him, </span> at home and at leisure. <span class="ital">To eat</span> the relics of the sacrifices, according to the manner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He doth bless the sacrifice, </span> i.e. either, first, The meat left of the sacrifice, which is the matter of the following feast; as this is commonly understood.

For that the sacrifices under the law were accompanied with confession, or petition, or thanksgiving, may be gathered from divers places of Scripture, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/leviticus/5-5.htm" title="And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he has sinned in that thing:">Leviticus 5:5</a> 16:21 <a href="/numbers/5-7.htm" title="Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.">Numbers 5:7</a> <a href="/luke/1-10.htm" title="And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.">Luke 1:10</a></span>.

By which it seems that the house of Samuel was at that end of it at which they entered; and with which agrees what is observed in the preceding verse, that "he was before them", his house was in sight of them: <p>before he go up to the high place to eat; intimating they would, if they made haste, come up to him before he got thither to sit down and eat with the people; for if they did not, they would not be able to see him and speak with him for some time, if on that day: <p>for the people will not eat until he come; partly out of affection and veneration for him, being their chief magistrate, as well as seer or prophet, and partly for the reason following: <p>because he doth bless the sacrifice; ask a blessing upon it, upon the meat of the peace offerings before it was eaten; for as this was usually done at every common meal, then much more at such a solemn festival as this. Jarchi gives us the form of blessing used on such an occasion,"blessed art thou, O Lord our God, the King of the world, who hath sanctified us by his commandments, and hath commanded us to eat the sacrifice:''and "afterwards they eat that be bidden"; for when a man offered his peace offerings, he not only had his family with him, but invited his friends, and the poor, and the fatherless, the strangers, and the Levites, to partake with him, see <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>, the number of the guests at this time, see in <a href="/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a>. <p>Now therefore get ye up; ascend the hill as fast as ye can: <p>for about this time ye shall find him; that is, by the time they could get up the hill into the city they would find him coming out of his house to go to the sacrifice: or "as this day" (h); so sure as the day is, so sure shall ye find him. <p>(h) "invenietis cum tam certo quam certum est hunc diem esse", Drusius; so Jarchi. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> bless the sacrifice; <i>and</i> afterwards they eat that be bidden.

The latter word should be omitted, as they simply say that on entering the city Saul and his servant would easily find Samuel; for he would not go up to the feast till all was ready, nor would the people begin till he had arrived, because it was his office to bless the sacrificial banquet. The pious custom of asking a blessing on meals, our Lord's "giving of thanks," is inherited by us from the Jews. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Saul's objection, that they had no present to bring to the man of God, as the bread was gone from their vessels, was met by the servant with the remark, that he had a quarter of a shekel which he would give.</body></html>
