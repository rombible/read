He conducted him to the flat roof of his house, often the favourite locality in the East for quiet conversation or rest, and where frequently the honoured guest was lodged for the night: there the prophet had a long interview with his young guest, The conversation that evening probably did not turn upon the royal dignity, so soon to be conferred on Saul; of that Samuel spoke at length, we know, on the following morning. The solemn words of the old man that evening on the house-top in “Ramah of the Watchers” referred, no doubt, to the sad religious and political decline of the people of God, from which he (Samuel) had laboured, not unsuccessfully, to rescue them, “to the opposition of the heathen nations, the causes of the impotency of Israel to oppose their enemies, the necessity of a religious change in the people, and of a leader thoroughly obedient to the Lord.”—Otto von Gerlach, quoted in <span class= "ital">Lange. </span>It has been suggested that this conversation was the connecting link between that on the height (<a href="/context/1_samuel/9-19.htm" title="And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place; for you shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.">1Samuel 9:19-20</a>) and the communication which Samuel made to Saul the following morning. The LXX. reads here, instead of “communed with Saul on the top of the house,” “they strewed a couch for Saul on the top of the house, and he lay down.” But the Chaldee and Syriac Versions agree with the Hebrew text. The strange LXX. variation is apparently a correction. These Greek translators could not understand a conversation of the prophet and Saul taking place in the evening, when the announcement of the crown was made so formally on the following morning. Why did Samuel not tell Saul of God’s intention during that evening spent together?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/9-25.htm" title="And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul on the top of the house.">1 Samuel 9:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Samuel communed with Saul — </span>Concerning the kingdom designed for him by God, and his administration of the government; <span class="ital">upon the top of the house — </span>For coolness in the evening, and privacy.

Both that evening and early the next morning, Samuel communed with Saul upon the flat roof of the house. We may suppose Samuel now convinced Saul that he was the person God had fixed upon for the government, and of his own willingness to resign. How different are the purposes of the Lord for us, from our intentions for ourselves! Perhaps Saul was the only one who ever went out to seek asses, and literally found a kingdom; but many have set out and moved their dwellings to seek riches and pleasures, who have been guided to places where they found salvation for their souls. Thus they have met with those who addressed them as if aware of the secrets of their lives and hearts, and have been led seriously to regard the word of the Lord. If this has been our case, though our worldly plans have not prospered, let us not care for that; the Lord has given us, or has prepared us for, what is far better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The shoulder and its appurtenances - would give the sense accurately.

Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house&#8212;Saul was taken to lodge with the prophet for that night. Before retiring to rest, they communed on the flat roof of the house, the couch being laid there (Jos 2:6), when, doubtless, Samuel revealed the secret and described the peculiar duties of a monarch in a nation so related to the Divine King as Israel. Next morning early, Samuel roused his guest, and conveying him on his way towards the skirts of the city, sought, before parting, a private interview&#8212;the object of which is narrated in the next chapter.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Samuel communed with Saul, </span> concerning the kingdom designed to him by God, and his duty to expect it patiently, till God actually called him to it; and to administer it piously, and justly, and valiantly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The top of the house</span> was flat, after the manner, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/22-8.htm" title="When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you bring not blood on your house, if any man fall from there.">Deu 22:8</a></span>; and so fit for walking, and for secret prayers, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a> <a href="/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9</a></span>, or any private and familiar discourses among friends. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they came down from the high place into the city,....

On the housetop they would be open to the public view so that all could see the honour Samuel shewed his guest, while they would have opportunity for undisturbed conversation. The Sept. however reads, “And he came down from the high place into the city: and they prepared a bed for Saul on the housetop and he slept. And it came to pass, &c.” This may perhaps represent the original text, for it seems strange to say first “they arose early,” and then proceed to describe Samuel’s calling Saul. The flat roof of an oriental house is still “resorted to for business, relaxation, or for sleeping … During a large part of he year it is the most agreeable place about the establishment, especially in the morning and evening.” See Thomson’s <span class="ital">Land and the Book</span>, p. 39 ff.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - When the feast was over they went down from the high place, and, having entered the city, proceeded to Samuel's dwelling, where he <span class="cmt_word">communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</span> The Septuagint has a very probable reading, namely, "And they spread a bed for Saul upon the roof, and he lay down;" but the Syriac and Chaldee agree with the Hebrew. Without communicating to Saul that he was to be king, which was not revealed to him till the next day (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), Samuel might be anxious to impress on Saul's mind the great principles of the theocratic government, and also the nature of the remedies necessary for Israel's recovery from its present misery. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel replied, "I am the seer: go up before me to the high place, and eat with me to-day; and to-morrow I will send thee away, and make known to thee all that is in thy heart." Letting a person go in front was a sign of great esteem. The change from the singular &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; to the plural &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; may be explained on the ground that, whilst Samuel only spoke to Saul, he intended expressly to invite his servant to the meal as well as himself. "All that is in thine heart" does not mean "all that thou hast upon thy heart," i.e., all that troubles thee, for Samuel relieved him of all anxiety about the asses at once by telling him that they were found; but simply the thoughts of thy heart generally. Samuel would make these known to him, to prove to him that he was a prophet. He then first of all satisfied him respecting the asses (<a href="/1_samuel/9-20.htm">1 Samuel 9:20</a>): "As for the asses that were lost to thee to-day three days (three days ago), do not set thy heart upon them (i.e., do not trouble thyself about them), for they are found." After this quieting announcement, by which he had convinced Saul of his seer's gift, Samuel directed Saul's thoughts to that higher thing which Jehovah had appointed for him: "And to whom does all that is worth desiring of Israel belong? Is it not to thee, and to all thy father's house?" "The desire of Israel" (optima quaeque Israel, Vulg.; "the best in Israel," Luther) is not all that Israel desires, but all that Israel possesses of what is precious or worth desiring (see <a href="/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>). "The antithesis here is between the asses and every desirable thing" (Seb. Schmidt). Notwithstanding the indefinite character of the words, they held up such glorious things as in prospect for Saul, that he replied in amazement (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), "Am not I a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family is the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin (&#1489;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497; is unquestionably a copyist's error for &#1489;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;); and how speakest thou such a word to me?" Samuel made no reply to this, as he simply wanted first of all to awaken the expectation in Saul's mind of things that he had never dreamt of before.</body></html>
