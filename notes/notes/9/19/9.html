Once more—<p>“Out of the black mid-tent’s silence, a space of three days,<p>Not a sound hath escaped to thy servants of prayer nor of<p>praise,<p>To betoken that Saul and the spirit have ended their strife,<p>And that, faint in his triumph, the monarch sinks back<p>upon life.”<p>BROWNING: <span class= "ital">Saul.</span><p>But the time when the skilled musician with his Divine strains had roused him into life again was passed (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/16-21.htm" title="And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.">1Samuel 16:21-23</a>), not now as in old days, when, to use the words the great poet put into David’s mouth—<p>“—I looked up to know<p>If the best I could do had brought solace: he spoke not, but<p>slow<p>Lifted up the hand slack at his side, till he laid it with care,<p>Soft and grave, but in mild settled will, on my brow; through<p>my hair<p>The large fingers were pushed, and he bent back my head.<p>with kind power—<p>All my face back, intent to peruse it as men do a flower.<p>Thus held he me there, with his great eye that scrutinized<p>mine,<p>And oh, all my heart how it loved him! . . .”<p>BROWNING: <span class= "ital">Saul.</span><p>This time, seizing the tall spear which was ever by his side, he hurled it with deadly intent at the sorrow-stricken, loving face, and David fled in hot haste from the doomed presence for ever. The LXX. was offended at the statement “evil spirit of (or from) Jehovah,” and cuts the knot by leaving out “Jehovah.” It is, no doubt, a hard saying, and no human expositor has ever yet been able fully to explain it.<p>To the expression <span class= "ital">Ruach Jehovah, </span>“Spirit of Jehovah” (for “of” is more accurate than “from”), and the equivalent phrase, <span class= "ital">Ruach Elohim, </span>“Spirit of God” (<a href="/context/1_samuel/16-14.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.">1Samuel 16:14-15</a>), the epithet “evil” is added. We cannot attempt to fathom the mysteries of the spirit world—we have absolutely no data—we simply possess in the sacred book a few scattered notices, which indicate the existence of evil spirits. To suppose that these malignant or evil beings were part of the heavenly host <span class= "ital">employed </span>by the Eternal is a supposition utterly at variance with our conception of the All-Father. We may, however, safely grant (1) the <span class= "ital">existence </span>of evil spirits—probably beings fallen through sin and disobedience from their high estate; and (2) we may suppose that these evil spirits—all, of course, belonging to the Eternal, even in their deep degradation (so though “<span class= "ital">evil,” </span>still “spirits of God, or Jehovah,”)—receive occasional permission, for some wise—though to us unknown—reasons, to tempt and plague for a season the souls of certain men.<p>The introduction to the Book of Job (<a href="/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="/context/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.">Job 2:1-7</a>), and the circumstance which led to the death of King Ahab before Ramoth Gilead (<a href="/context/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19-22</a>), at least favour this hypothesis. The presence of those evil spirits, or “devils, who possessed those unhappy ones whom we meet so often in the Gospel story, points to the same conclusion. Why certain souls should have been exposed to this dread experience is, of course, beyond our ken. From the scanty information vouchsafed to us, it seems, however, that the power of the evil spirit was sometimes permitted to be exercised (a) as a trial of faith, as in the case of Job; or (b) as a punishment incurred by the soul’s desertion of God, as in the case of Saul.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-10 How forcible are right words!

When Saul spoke to his son Jonathan and all his servants about his intention to kill David (&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, i.e., not that they should kill David, but "that he intended to kill him"), Jonathan reported this to David, because he was greatly attached to him, and gave him this advice: "Take heed to thyself in the morning; keep thyself in a secret place, and hide thyself. I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will talk to my father about thee (&#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, etc., to talk of or about a person), and see what (sc., he will say), and show it to thee." David was to conceal himself in the field near to where Jonathan would converse with his father about him; not that he might hear the conversation in his hiding-place, but that Jonathan might immediately report to him the result of his conversation, without there being any necessity for going far away from his father, so as to excite suspicion that he was in league with David. </body></html>
