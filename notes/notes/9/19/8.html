David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter&#8212;A brilliant victory was gained over the public enemy. But these fresh laurels of David reawakened in the moody breast of Saul the former spirit of envy and melancholy. On David's return to court, the temper of Saul became more fiendish than ever; the melodious strains of the harp had lost all their power to charm; and in a paroxysm of uncontrollable frenzy he aimed a javelin at the person of David&#8212;the missile having been thrown with such force that it pierced the chamber wall.

When Saul spoke to his son Jonathan and all his servants about his intention to kill David (&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, i.e., not that they should kill David, but "that he intended to kill him"), Jonathan reported this to David, because he was greatly attached to him, and gave him this advice: "Take heed to thyself in the morning; keep thyself in a secret place, and hide thyself. I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will talk to my father about thee (&#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, etc., to talk of or about a person), and see what (sc., he will say), and show it to thee." David was to conceal himself in the field near to where Jonathan would converse with his father about him; not that he might hear the conversation in his hiding-place, but that Jonathan might immediately report to him the result of his conversation, without there being any necessity for going far away from his father, so as to excite suspicion that he was in league with David. </body></html>
