In flying to Samuel, David made God his refuge. Samuel, as a prophet, was best able to advise him what to do in this day of distress. He met with little rest or satisfaction in Saul's court, therefore went to seek it in Samuel's church. What little pleasure is to be had in this world, those have who live a life of communion with God; to that David returned in the time of trouble. So impatient was Saul after David's blood, so restless against him, that although baffled by one providence after another, he could not see that David was under the special protection of God. And when God will take this way to protect David, even Saul prophesies. Many have great gifts, yet no grace; they may prophesy in Christ's name, yet are disowned by him. Let us daily seek for renewing grace, which shall be in us as a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Let us cleave to truth and holiness with full purpose of heart. In every danger and trouble, let us seek protection, comfort, and direction in God's ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No such place as Naioth (or Nevaioth) is known, but the word means "dwellings." Hence, it is considered that Naioth was the name of the collegiate residence of the prophets, in, or just outside, Ramah, to which Samuel removed with David from his own house, for greater safety, owing to the sanctity of the place and company. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 19:18-23. David Flees to Samuel.<p>18-23. David fled, &#8230; and came to Samuel to Ramah&#8212;Samuel was living in great retirement, superintending the school of the prophets, established in the little hamlet of Naioth, in the neighborhood of Ramah. It was a retreat congenial to the mind of David; but Saul, having found out his asylum, sent three successive bodies of men to apprehend him. The character of the place and the influence of the sacred exercises produced such an effect on them that they were incapable of discharging their commission, and were led, by a resistless impulse, to join in singing the praises of God. Saul, in a fit of rage and disappointment, determined to go himself. But, before reaching the spot, his mental susceptibilities were roused even more than his messengers, and he was found, before long, swelling the ranks of the young prophets. This singular change can be ascribed only to the power of Him who can turn the hearts of men even as the rivers of water.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">near Ramah</span>; the Hebrew preposition <span class="ital">beth</span>, in, being oft put for near, as it is apparently used, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/33-37.htm" title="And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.">Numbers 33:37</a>,38 Jos 5:13 <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm" title="Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 20:2</a> 32:7</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Naioth</span> was either a house or college in the town of Ramah, or a village in the territory of <span class="ital">Ramah</span>, or near to the town of <span class="ital">Ramah</span>; in which there was a college of the prophets, amongst whom Samuel thought David might be secure. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was told Saul,.... By some officious persons who saw David at Ramah, and observed that he and Samuel went together to Naioth: <p>saying, behold, David is at Naioth, in Ramah; or near it; according to R. Isaiah, Ramah was the name of a hill, or mountain, so called from its height, and Naioth the name of a place on it; it signifies pastures and pleasant places, as meadows and pastures are; and here in the fields near Ramah was the house of doctrine, as the Targum calls it, or the school of the prophets, being pleasant and retired, and fit for study. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - On hearing where David was, Saul sends messengers to arrest him, and we thus incidentally gain a most interesting account of the inner condition of Samuel's schools. Evidently after Saul had become king Samuel devoted his main energies to this noble effort to raise Israel from the barbarous depths into which it had sunk; and when the messengers arrive they enter some hall, where they find a regularly organised choir, consisting not of "sons of the prophets," young men still under training, but <span class="cmt_word">of prophets,</span> men who had finished their preparatory studies, and arrived at a higher elevation. The Chaldee Paraphrast calls them <span class="accented">scribes</span>; and doubtless those educated in Samuel's schools held an analogous position to that of the scribes in later days. And <span class="cmt_word">Samuel</span> himself was <span class="cmt_word">standing</span> - not <span class="cmt_word">as appointed over them</span>; he was the founder and originator of these schools, and all authority was derived from him. What the Hebrew says is that he was "standing as chief over them," and they, frill of Divine enthusiasm, were chanting psalms to God's glory. So noble was the sight, that Saul's messengers on entering were seized with a like enthusiasm, and, laying aside their murderous purpose, joined in the hearty service of the prophetic sanctuary. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">they saw</span> the Hebrew has "he saw," but as all the versions have the plural, it is probably a mere mistake. The Hebrew word for <span class="cmt_word">company</span> is found only here. By transposing the letters we have the ordinary word for <span class="accented">congregation</span>, but possibly it was their own technical name for some peculiar arrangement of the choir. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Michal then took the teraphim, - i.e., in all probability an image of the household gods of the size of life, and, judging from what follows, in human form, - laid it in the bed, and put a piece of woven goats' hair at his head, i.e., either round or over the head of the image, and covered it with the garment (beged, the upper garment, which was generally only a square piece of cloth for wrapping round), and told the messengers whom Saul had sent to fetch him that he was ill. Michal probably kept teraphim in secret, like Rachel, because of her barrenness (see at <a href="/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>). The meaning of &#1492;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is doubtful. The earlier translators took it to mean goat-skin, with the exception of the Seventy, who confounded &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;, liver, upon which Josephus founds his account of Michal having placed a still moving goat's liver in the bed, to make the messengers believe that there was a breathing invalid beneath. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, signifies something woven, and &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; goats' hair, as in <a href="/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>. But it is impossible to decide with certainty what purpose the cloth of goats' hair was to serve; whether it was merely to cover the head of the teraphim with hair, and so make it like a human head, or to cover the head and face as if of a person sleeping. The definite article not only before &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, but also with &#1492;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, suggests the idea that all these things belonged to Michal's house furniture, and that &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; was probably a counterpane made of goats' hair, with which persons in the East are in the habit of covering the head and face when sleeping. </body></html>
