We are told (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1Samuel 10:10</a>) that directly after his anointing by Samuel, he met a company of prophets, who were prophesying at Gibeah, and that “the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.” On <span class= "ital">that </span>occasion he had been changed into another man. What was the meaning of the outpouring upon the faithless king now? The Chaldee, according to Raschi’s explanation, says <span class= "ital">he was mad. </span>Is it not, however, better to explain the incident by understanding that once more the pitiful Spirit pleaded with the man whom the Lord had chosen to be His anointed? But, alas! when the moment of strange excitement was over, the blessed pleading was forgotten. Is not this a matter of every-day experience?<p><span class= "bld">And lay down naked.</span>—Not necessarily without any clothes, for under the tunic there was worn by men of the upper ranks certainly a fine-woven shirt of linen or cotton. Lyranus explains the words “stripped off his clothes” as simply denoting that he threw off his upper garment, “his royal robe.”<p><span class= "bld">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span>—The same thing having taken place before (see <a href="/1_samuel/10-12.htm" title="And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 10:12</a>), this saying gained currency among the people. There seemed something strange to men in one so self-willed and disobedient as was Saul receiving, as it seemed to the by-standers, the Divine and much coveted gift. “Many,” says St. Augustine, “are the gifts of God which are possessed by evil men. Evil men have often great talents, great skill, great wealth. . . . The gift of prophesy is a great gift, but it was possessed by Saul. Saul, an evil king, prophesied at the very time he was persecuting holy David. Let not, therefore, men boast if they have God’s gifts; those gifts will profit them nothing without charity (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.">1Corinthians 13:1-2</a>). But let them think of the fearful account they must one day give to God, if they use not holy things holily.”—<span class= "ital">St. Augustine, </span>in Psalms 103, quoted by Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm" title="And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.

In flying to Samuel, David made God his refuge. Samuel, as a prophet, was best able to advise him what to do in this day of distress. He met with little rest or satisfaction in Saul's court, therefore went to seek it in Samuel's church. What little pleasure is to be had in this world, those have who live a life of communion with God; to that David returned in the time of trouble. So impatient was Saul after David's blood, so restless against him, that although baffled by one providence after another, he could not see that David was under the special protection of God. And when God will take this way to protect David, even Saul prophesies. Many have great gifts, yet no grace; they may prophesy in Christ's name, yet are disowned by him. Let us daily seek for renewing grace, which shall be in us as a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Let us cleave to truth and holiness with full purpose of heart. In every danger and trouble, let us seek protection, comfort, and direction in God's ordinances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Naked - i. e., without his robe and other outer garments, but only the shirt.

Not all his clothes, but his upper garments, as men in such circumstances used to do, as the prophets sometimes did, and as it seems his messengers had done; according to Jarchi, R. Isaiah, and others (n), he stripped himself of his royal robes, and put on the habit of the scholars, the disciples, and sons of the prophets: <p>and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, as the messengers had done, singing such like songs, or foretelling such like things as they did; he and they speaking not of themselves, but as they were moved by the Holy Spirit of prophecy; for such gifts have sometimes been bestowed on men that were destitute of the grace of God, as Balaam, Caiaphas, and others: <p>and lay down: or "fell down" (o), as persons in an ecstasy or trance: and lay <p>naked all that day, and all that night; not entirely naked, both without his upper garment or royal robes, or else his armour; so an unarmed man is said to be naked, though otherwise he has his clothes on: thus Gelon having conquered the Carthaginians, and made himself master of all Sicily, went into the forum "naked" (i.e. unarmed), and declared he would restore the government to the citizens, wherefore a naked statue for him was erected in the temple of Juno (p); so Quinctius Cincinnatus was found ploughing naked (q), who cannot be supposed to be without any clothes on him. Jarchi, from Menachem, reports, that he had heard from an Arabian, that the word the Targum makes use of for "naked", signifies, in the Arabic language, one that is furious or mad, as persons in an ecstasy, or under a prophetic spirit, sometimes seemed to be; now Saul was kept and held in such circumstances a whole day and night, that David might have an opportunity of making his escape, and getting at such a distance from him that he could not overtake him: <p>wherefore they say, is Saul also among the prophets? this became a common saying, a proverbial expression, at least was now revived and observed with admiration; that Saul, who had behaved himself in so ill a manner, as an enemy to so good a man, should be found among the prophets of the Lord, and prophesying as they did. <p>(n) Vid.
