And as he swore inconsiderately, so, he as quickly and inconsiderately broke his oath; which may be a lesson to us never to take an oath upon any occasion, but with the greatest seriousness and an inward veneration, <a href="/context/1_samuel/19-8.htm" title="And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him....">1 Samuel 19:8-9</a>. <span class="ital">And there was war again — </span>The battles of which were only between parties, for David commanded no more than a thousand men, <a href="/1_samuel/18-13.htm" title="Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.">1 Samuel 18:13</a>.

Jonathan spake good of David&#8212;He told his father he was committing a great sin to plot against the life of a man who had rendered the most invaluable services to his country and whose loyalty had been uniformly steady and devoted. The strong remonstrances of Jonathan produced an effect on the impulsive mind of his father. As he was still susceptible of good and honest impressions, he bound himself by an oath to relinquish his hostile purpose; and thus, through the intervention of the noble-minded prince, a temporary reconciliation was effected, in consequence of which David was again employed in the public service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This great change is not to be ascribed to any true repentance for his sin against David, or any better affection which he now had to him; but merely to his own worldly interest, because he was convinced by Jonathan’s discourse that he could not kill him without great inconvenience and shame to himself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan,.... Not only heard him out what he had to say, but was affected with it, and wrought upon by it, and was convicted for the present that he was wrong in seeking the life of David, and therefore would desist from it; the Lord working upon his mind by what Jonathan said, and inclined him to listen to it, and act accordingly: <p>and Saul sware, as the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain; this oath he added to what he said to Jonathan, for the confirmation of it; and which was taken either with a real intention to keep it, though that intention did not long continue; or with a view to deceive Jonathan, that he might acquaint David with it, and so prevent his flight and escape, and that he might the more easily fall into his hands; but the former seems rather to be the case. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> sware, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</span><p>(c) Whatever he pretended outwardly, yet his heart was full of malice.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Saul sware</span>] Sincerely no doubt for the time, but with no real repentance for his murderous design.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The occasion for the practical manifestation of this enmity was the success of David in all his engagements with the Philistines.

With this general remark the way is prepared for the further history of Saul's conduct towards David. </body></html>
