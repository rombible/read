Jonathan spake good of David&#8212;He told his father he was committing a great sin to plot against the life of a man who had rendered the most invaluable services to his country and whose loyalty had been uniformly steady and devoted. The strong remonstrances of Jonathan produced an effect on the impulsive mind of his father. As he was still susceptible of good and honest impressions, he bound himself by an oath to relinquish his hostile purpose; and thus, through the intervention of the noble-minded prince, a temporary reconciliation was effected, in consequence of which David was again employed in the public service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jonathan called David,....

When Saul spoke to his son Jonathan and all his servants about his intention to kill David (&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; &#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, i.e., not that they should kill David, but "that he intended to kill him"), Jonathan reported this to David, because he was greatly attached to him, and gave him this advice: "Take heed to thyself in the morning; keep thyself in a secret place, and hide thyself. I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will talk to my father about thee (&#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>, etc., to talk of or about a person), and see what (sc., he will say), and show it to thee." David was to conceal himself in the field near to where Jonathan would converse with his father about him; not that he might hear the conversation in his hiding-place, but that Jonathan might immediately report to him the result of his conversation, without there being any necessity for going far away from his father, so as to excite suspicion that he was in league with David. </body></html>
