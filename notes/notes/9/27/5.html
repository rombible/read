Achish trusted that through David’s assistance powerful military demonstrations in the southern districts of Saul’s kingdom might be made. At this time the Philistine nation were preparing for that grand national effort against Saul which culminated in the battle of Mount Gilboa. David, on the other hand, intended, from a comparatively secure centre of operations somewhere in Philistia, to harry those nomad foes of Israel whose home was in the deserts to the south of Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/27-5.htm" title="And David said to Achish, If I have now found grace in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?">1 Samuel 27:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let them give me a place — </span>This was a prudent request of David, who hereby intended to preserve his people, both from the vices to which conversation with the Philistines would have exposed them, and from that envy and malice which a different religion, and his appearing like a prince with so many men under his command, might have caused.

We may blush to think that the word of a Philistine should go further than the word of an Israelite, and that the city of Gath should be a place of refuge for a good man, when the cities of Israel refuse him a safe abode.

After he had been some time with him: <p>if I have now found grace in thine eyes; or was in favour, as he thought himself to be, by various instances of respect shown him: <p>let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: he does not ask for a city or town, but a place in one of them, though one was given him; but of whom he asks it, it is not easy to say; though it is certain that Achish gave it him, <a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>. Perhaps he might desire it might be given him by Achish, with the consent of his princes and nobles, or at least of his privy council; that so it might be to general satisfaction, and the grant more authentic; though it may be impersonally read, as in the Vulgate Latin version, "let there be given me", &amp;c. David's view in this might be partly to prevent the envy of the courtiers of Achish, who might think that David was too near the king, and might have too great an interest in him, and receive too many of his favours, and become his chief confidant and prime minister; and partly to preserve himself and people from all temptations to idolatry, and corruptions in religion; as also that ho might have an opportunity, without the knowledge of Achish, to fall upon the enemies of Israel; though the excuse he made was as follows: <p>for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee? for so Gath was; and six hundred men and their families might seem to crowd the city; and this reasoning of his might suggest, that he and his men were a straitening of him, and a burden on him; and it might seem as if he was a rival with him in state and dignity, when he was no other than a servant of his. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</span><p>(c) Let your officers appoint me a place.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">in some town in the country</span>] In one of the provincial cities as distinguished from the metropolis Gath.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">why should thy servant dwell</span>, &c.] He wished for a more independent position, where he might be less exposed to the jealousy of the Philistine lords, and have free opportunity for ruling and organizing his followers.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If l have now found grace in thine eyes.</span> <span class="accented">Now</span> is not an adverb of time, but means "I pray," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> If verily I have found favour with thee. David's position was one of difficulty. The fame of his exploits, and of Saul's vain pursuit of him, made Achish no doubt regard him as a bitter foe of the Israelite king, and expect valuable assistance from him; whereas David was unwilling to take up arms even against Saul, and much less against his own countrymen. He is anxious, therefore, to get away from a too close observation of his acts, and requests Achish to give him <span class="cmt_word">a place in some town in the country.</span> Hebrew, "a place in one of the cities in the field." <span class="cmt_word">Why should thy servant,</span> etc. David's presence with so large a following must in many ways have been inconvenient as well as expensive to Achish. In some small country town David and his men would maintain themselves. Achish accordingly gives him <span class="cmt_word">Ziklag</span>, a small place assigned first of all to Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-31.htm">Joshua 15:31</a>), but subsequently to Simeon (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 19:5). Its exact position is not known. It seems to have been valued by David's successors, as it is noted that it still belonged <span class="cmt_word">unto the kings of Judah.</span> This phrase proves that the Book of Samuel must have been compiled at a date subsequent to the revolt of Jeroboam, while the concluding words, <span class="cmt_word">unto this day,</span> equally plainly indicate a date prior to the Babylonian exile.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Behold, as thy soul has been greatly esteemed in my eyes to-day, so will my soul be greatly esteemed in the eyes of Jehovah, that He will save me out of all tribulation." These words do not contain any "sounding of his own praises" (Thenius), but are merely the testimony of a good conscience before God in the presence of an enemy, who is indeed obliged to confess his wrong-doing, but who no longer feels or acknowledges his need of forgiveness. For even Saul's reply to these words in <a href="/1_samuel/26-25.htm">1 Samuel 26:25</a> ("Blessed art thou, my son David: thou wilt undertake, and also prevail:" &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, lit. to vanquish, i.e., to carry out what one undertakes) does not express any genuine goodwill towards David, but only an acknowledgment, forced upon him by this fresh experience of David's magnanimity, that God was blessing all his undertakings, so that he would prevail. Saul had no more thoughts of any real reconciliation with David. "David went his way, and Saul turned to his place" (cf. <a href="/numbers/24-25.htm">Numbers 24:25</a>). Thus they parted, and never saw each other again. There is nothing said about Saul returning to his house, as there was when his life was first spared (<a href="/1_samuel/24-22.htm">1 Samuel 24:22</a>). On the contrary, he does not seem to have given up pursuing David; for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1-12</a>, David was obliged to take refuge in a foreign land, and carry out what he had described in <a href="/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a> as his greatest calamity. </body></html>
