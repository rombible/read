No captive was to be left alive to tell the tale to King Achish, who was under the delusion that David’s feats of arms were carried out at the expense of his own countrymen, whose lands he was harrying. At this the Philistine rejoiced when he heard David was thus burning his only bridge of retreat: by alienating by these cruelties the affection of the people of Israel, by means of which, at some future time, he might have been recalled to his native land. There were a few occasions in the history of the chosen race when a war of extermination was commended. Then Israel was simply the stern instrument of wrath, used—as a pestilence is at times—to carry out the will of the earth’s Master; but David had no such charge. Was it not these acts of ruthless cruelty which left on this king’s hands the stain of blood which rendered them unfit in after days to build the House of the Lord he longed so passionately to erect? (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel.</span>—To fight under David’s banner now promised to be a lucrative service as well as an adventurous and wild career. Here at Ziklag, and for some time previously, we hear of brave discontented spirits from all parts of Israel joining him. In 1 Chronicles 12 we have a long and accurate list of heroes who formed that Ziklag band. Amongst these gallant soldiers who now, to use the chronicler’s term, “day by day came to David to help him,” were a troop of Benjamites who had joined him some time before: their leader Amasai, on being questioned as to their reason for joining him, answered, “We are on thy side, thou son of Jesse . . . for thy God helpeth thee” (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm" title="Then the spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Your are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.">1Chronicles 12:18</a>). The words of Amasai express the feeling which seems to have pervaded Israel at that time in reference to David. The people throughout the land were coming to feel that Jehovah had indeed chosen David. The chronicler even speaks of David’s band at Ziklag, after the recruits from all parts of Israel had poured in, “as a great host, like the host of God” (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-22.htm" title="For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.">1Chronicles 12:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/27-9.htm" title="And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.">1 Samuel 27:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">And left neither man nor woman alive — </span>In that part where he came; but there were many of the Amalekites yet left in another part of that land.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:8-12 While David was in the land of the Philistines, he attacked some remains of the devoted nations. The people whom he cut off were long before doomed to destruction. It is often wisdom to shun public notice, but we must in no situation be idle. We must always try to do somewhat in the cause of God. This expedition David hid from Achish. But an equivocation which serves the purpose of a lie, is as like to it as a hypocrite is to a profane person, it is only better in appearance, therefore more dangerous. Yet, though believers often manifest imperfections, they can never be prevailed upon to renounce the service of God, and to unite interests with his enemies, or finally to become the servants of sin and Satan. But what a train of evils follow from unbelief! When we forget the Lord's past mercies, and his gracious assurances, we shall be overwhelmed with desponding fears, and probably be led to adopt some dishonourable method to get rid of our troubles. Nothing can so effectually establish us in holy tempers and practices, and preserve us from perplexities, as firm, unshaken dependence upon the promises of God in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Geshurites bordered upon the Philistines, and lived in the mountainous district which terminates the desert on the northeast (marginal reference).

They also seem to have brought David great renown, for in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-22</a> we read of warriors from far distant tribes coming to him to swell his forces, and the enthusiasm for him was even such that a band of men swam across the Jordan to join him (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 15); while others from Manasseh deserted to him from Saul's army before the battle of Mount Gilboa, so that at last he had with him "a great host, like the host of God" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 19-21). <span class="cmt_word">He came to Achish.</span> To give him a portion of the spoil. <span class="cmt_word">And Achish said.</span> Like the verb <span class="accented">went up</span> in ver. 8, the word indicates repeated action.
