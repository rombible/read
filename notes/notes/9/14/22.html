The more evident it was that God did all, the more reason Saul had to inquire whether God would give him leave to do any thing. But he was in such haste to fight a fallen enemy, that he would not stay to end his devotions, nor hear what answer God would give him. He that believeth, will not make such haste, nor reckon any business so urgent, as not to allow time to take God with him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Assembled themselves - See marg.

The spies of Saul at Gibeah saw how the multitude (in the camp of the Philistines) melted away and was beaten more and more. The words &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; are obscure. The Rabbins are unanimous in adopting the explanation magis magisque frangebatur, and have therefore probably taken &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; as an inf. absol. &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;, and interpreted &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; according to <a href="/judges/5-26.htm">Judges 5:26</a>. This was also the case with the Chaldee; and Gesenius (Thes. p. 383) has adopted the same rendering, except that he has taken &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; in the sense of dissolutus, dissipatus est. Others take &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; as adverbial ("and thither"), and supply the correlate &#1492;&#1500;&#1501; (hither), so as to bring out the meaning "hither and thither."
