Those Israelites whom the Philistines had incorporated into their army are called Hebrews, according to the name which was current among foreigners, whilst those who were with Saul are called Israel, according to the sacred name of the nation. The difficulty which many expositors have found in the word &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; has been very correctly solved, so far as the sense is concerned, by the earlier translators, by the interpolation of "they returned:" &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (Chald.), &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; (lxx), reversi sunt (Vulg.), and similarly the Syriac and Arabic. We are not at liberty, however, to amend the Hebrew text in this manner, as nothing more is omitted than the finite verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; before the infinitive &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; (for this construction, see Gesenius, Gramm. 132, 3, Anm. 1), and this might easily be left out here, since it stands at the beginning of the verse in the main clause. The literal rendering would be, they were to be with Israel, i.e., they came over to Israel. The fact that the Hebrews who were serving in the army of the Philistines came over to Saul and his host, and turned their weapons against their oppressors, naturally heightened the confusion in the camp of the Philistines, and accelerated their defeat; and this was still further increased by the fact that the Israelites who had concealed themselves on the mountains of Ephraim also joined the Israelitish army, as soon as they heard of the flight of the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-22.htm">1 Samuel 14:22</a>).</body></html>
