Such is the nature of our bodies, that daily work cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father in heaven graciously gives.

The men of Israel were pressed (i.e., fatigued) on that day, sc., through the military service and fighting. Then Saul adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man that eateth bread until the evening, and (till) I have avenged myself upon mine enemies." &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;, fut. apoc. of &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, from &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, to swear, Hiphil to adjure or require an oath of a person. The people took the oath by saying "amen" to what Saul had uttered. This command of Saul did not proceed from a proper attitude towards the Lord, but was an act of false zeal, in which Saul had more regard to himself and his own kingly power than to the cause of the kingdom of Jehovah, as we may see at once from the expression &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "till I have avenged myself upon mine enemies." It was a despotic measure which not only failed to accomplish its object (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-30.htm">1 Samuel 14:30</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/14-31.htm">1 Samuel 14:31</a>), but brought Saul into the unfortunate position of being unable to carry out the oath (see <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a>). All the people kept the command. "They tasted no bread." &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1506;&#1501; is not to be connected with &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as an apodosis.</body></html>
