We have already observed that the age now closing had been peculiarly the age of vows. A similar terrible oath, equalling Saul’s in its rashness, had been taken by Jephthah. It is noticeable that not only Saul, who vowed the vow, but Jonathan, its victim, were convinced that the vow, though perhaps hastily and rashly made, must be kept. “Against both these,” says Erdman in <span class= "ital">Lange </span>with great force “rises the people’s voice as the voice of God, the question (in <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm" title="And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.">1Samuel 14:45</a>), ‘Shall Jonathan die? ‘and the answer,’ Far be it,’ expresses the sorrowful astonishment and the energetic protest of the people, who were inspired by Jonathan’s heroic deed and its brilliant result. . . . Over against Saul’s oath the people set their own: <span class= "ital">‘</span>As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground.’ Probably Saul was not unwilling in this awful question, when his son’s life trembled in the balance, to submit his will for once to the people’s.”<p>“Take then no vow at random: ta’en in faith,<p>Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,<p>Blindly to execute a rash resolve,<p>Whom better it had suited to exclaim,<p>‘I have done ill than to redeem his pledge<p>By doing worse.”—Dante, <span class= "ital">Paradise, </span>5:63-68.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:36-46 If God turns away our prayer, we have reason to suspect it is for some sin harboured in our hearts, which we should find out, that we may put it away, and put it to death. We should always first suspect and examine ourselves; but an unhumbled heart suspects every other person, and looks every where but at home for the sinful cause of calamity. Jonathan was discovered to be the offender. Those most indulgent to their own sins are most severe upon others; those who most disregard God's authority, are most impatient when their own commands are slighted. Such as cast abroad curses, endanger themselves and their families. What do we observe in the whole of Saul's behaviour on this occasion, but an impetuous, proud, malignant, impious disposition? And do we not in every instance perceive that man, left to himself, betrays the depravity of his nature, and is enslaved to the basest tempers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Give a perfect lot - The phrase is obscure, but the meaning is probably as in the margin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31-34. the people were very faint. And the people flew upon the spoil&#8212;at evening, when the time fixed by Saul had expired. Faint and famishing, the pursuers fell voraciously upon the cattle they had taken, and threw them on the ground to cut off their flesh and eat them raw, so that the army, by Saul's rashness, were defiled by eating blood, or living animals; probably, as the Abyssinians do, who cut a part of the animal's rump, but close the hide upon it, and nothing mortal follows from that wound. They were painfully conscientious in keeping the king's order for fear of the curse, but had no scruple in transgressing God's command. To prevent this violation of the law, Saul ordered a large stone to be rolled, and those that slaughtered the oxen to cut their throats on that stone. By laying the animal's head on the high stone, the blood oozed out on the ground, and sufficient evidence was afforded that the ox or sheep was dead before it was attempted to eat it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am sentenced to death for it; which is hard measure.
