The more evident it was that God did all, the more reason Saul had to inquire whether God would give him leave to do any thing. But he was in such haste to fight a fallen enemy, that he would not stay to end his devotions, nor hear what answer God would give him.

The rest of the verse is a gloss added by some scribe struck at this strange mention of the ark, which we know was still at Kirjath-jearim. It is itself corrupt and ungrammatical, being, "For the ark of God was in that day and the children of Israel." Still both the reading <span class="accented">ark</span> and the gloss are very ancient, being found in the versions, except the Septuagint, as above. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the two showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, they said, "Behold, Hebrews come forth out of the holes in which they have hidden themselves." And the men of the garrison cried out to Jonathan and his armour-bearer, "Come up to us, and we will tell you a word," i.e., we will communicate something to you. This was ridicule at the daring of the two men, whilst for all that they had not courage enough to meet them bravely and drive them back. In this Jonathan received the desired sign that the Lord had given the Philistines into the hand of the Israelites: he therefore clambered up the rock on his hands and feet, and his armour-bearer after him; and "they (the Philistines) fell before Jonathan," i.e., were smitten down by him, "and his armour-bearer was slaying behind him." </body></html>
