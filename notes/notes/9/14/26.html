Ben Gersom thinks that bee hives were placed here in rows by the wayside, from whence the honey flowed; or "went" (w), or there was a going of it; perhaps the combs being pressed by the Philistines as they fled: the land of Canaan was a land flowing with milk and honey: <p>but no man put his hand to his mouth; that is, took not any of the honey and ate it, though it was so near at hand, and there was plenty of it: <p>for the people feared the oath: Saul adjured them by, or the imprecation he made on the person that should eat any food that day. <p>(t) Bibliothec. l. 17. p. 548.
