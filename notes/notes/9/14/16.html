The noise in the host was also, no doubt, clearly heard at the distance of only two miles, and the army would have crossed the passage with comparatively little difficulty by the narrow path which leads down direct from Geba to Michmash, west of the Philistine camp. Thence the pursuit was towards Bethel, across the watershed, and headlong down the steep descent of Aijalon  -  that same pass where the first great victory of Joshua had been gained, and where the valiant Judas was once more, in later times, to drive back the enemies of Israel to the plains." <span class="cmt_word">The multitude.</span> The Hebrew is, "And behold the tumult (the word is so rendered in ver. 19, margin) was reeling and going...  and thither." Of course <span class="accented">hither</span> has dropped out of the text before and <span class="accented">thither</span> (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate both read "hither and thither." Tumult means the din made by a confused mass of people, and so the crowd itself. <span class="cmt_word">Melted away</span> does not give the exact meaning. The Philistines were not dispersing, but were <span class="accented">reeling</span>, moving to and fro purposeless, and in confusion. It may mean, however, to <span class="accented">shake</span> or <span class="accented">melt with terror, as</span> in <a href="/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">art dissolved.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Behold, we go over to the people and show ourselves to them. If they say to us, Wait (&#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, keep quiet) till we come to you, we will stand still in our place, and not go up to them; but if they say thus, Come up unto us, then we will go up, for Jehovah hath (in that case) delivered them into our hand." The sign was well chosen. If the Philistines said, "Wait till we come," they would show some courage; but if they said, "Come up to us," it would be a sign that they were cowardly, and had not courage enough to leave their position and attack the Hebrews. It was not tempting God for Jonathan to fix upon such a sign by which to determine the success of his enterprise; for he did it in the exercise of his calling, when fighting not for personal objects, but for the kingdom of God, which the uncircumcised were threatening to annihilate, and in the most confident belief that the Lord would deliver and preserve His people. Such faith as this God would not put to shame.</body></html>
