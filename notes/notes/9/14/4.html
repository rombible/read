Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance. Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(The southern cliff was called "Seneh," or "the acacia," and the same name still applies to the modern valley, dotted by acacias.

Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:112) says, "The site of the Philistine camp at Michmash, which Jonathan and his armour bearer attacked, is very minutely described by Josephus. It was, he says, a precipice with three tops, ending in a long, sharp tongue, and protected by surrounding cliffs. Exactly such a natural fortress exists immediately east of the village of Michmash, and is still called 'the fort' by the peasantry. It is a ridge rising in three rounded knolls above a perpendicular crag, ending in a narrow tongue to the east, with cliffs below, and having an open valley behind it, and a saddle towards the west, on which Michmash itself is situate. Opposite this fortress, on the south, there is a crag of equal height, and seemingly impassable. Thus the description of the Old Testament is fully borne out - 'a sharp rock on one side, and a sharp rock on the other.' The southern cliff was called <span class="cmt_word">Seneh</span>, or 'the acacia,' and the same name still applies to the modern valley, due to the acacia trees which dot its course. The northern cliff was called <span class="cmt_word">Bozez</span>, or 'shining,' and the true explanation of the name only presents itself on the spot." Conder then describes how, "treading perhaps almost in the steps of Jonathan, after arriving on the brink of the chasm, or defile of Michmash, they were able to descend Seneh, even with horses and mules. "I noticed," he says, "that the dip of the strata down eastward  gave hopes that by one of the long ledges we might be able to slide, as it were, towards the bottom. It is not likely that horses had ever before been led along this ledge, or will perhaps ever again cross the pathless chasm, but it was just possible, and by jumping them down one or two steps some three feet high, we succeeded in making the passage....  Though we got down Seneh, we did not attempt to climb up Bozez .... Horses could scarcely find a footing anywhere on the sides of the northern precipice; but judging from the descent, it seems possible that Jonathan, with immense labour, could have 'climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour bearer after him' (ver. 13). That a man exhausted by such an effort could have fought successfully on arriving at the top can only be accounted for on the supposition of a sudden panic among the Philistines, when they found the enemy actually within their apparently impregnable fortress." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Israelites could not offer a successful resistance to these devastating raids, as there was no smith to be found in the whole land: "For the Philistines thought the Hebrews might make themselves sword or spear" (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; followed by &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, "to say, or think, that not," equivalent to being unwilling that it should be done). Consequently (as the words clearly imply) when they proceeded to occupy the land of Israel as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, they disarmed the people throughout, i.e., as far as they penetrated, and carried off the smiths, who might have been able to forge weapons; so that, as is still further related in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20</a>, all Israel was obliged to go to the Philistines, every one to sharpen his edge-tool, and his ploughshare, and his axe, and his chopper. According to <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>, &#1488;&#1514; is an iron instrument used in agriculture; the majority of the ancient versions render it ploughshare. The word &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; is striking after the previous &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (from &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;); and the meaning of both words is uncertain. According to the etymology, &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; might denote any kind of edge-tool, even the ploughshare. The second &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; is rendered &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (his sickle) by the lxx, and sarculum by Jerome, a small garden hoe for loosening and weeding the soil. The fact that the word is connected with &#1511;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, the axe or hatchet, favours the idea that it signifies a hoe or spade rather than a sickle. Some of the words in <a href="/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a> are still more obscure. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, which is the reading adopted by all the earlier translators, indicates that the result is about to be given of the facts mentioned before: "And there came to pass," i.e., so that there came to pass (or arose), &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, "a blunting of the edges." &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, bluntness, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, to tear, hence to make blunt, is confirmed by the Arabic futa&#770;r, gladius fissuras habens, obtusus ensis, whereas the meaning to hammer, i.e., to sharpen by hammering, cannot be established. The insertion of the article before &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is as striking as the omission of it before &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; also the stat. abs. instead of the construct &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514;. These anomalies render it a very probable conjecture that the reading may have been &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; (inf. Hiph. nomin.). Accordingly the rendering would be, "so that bluntness of the edges occurred in the edge-tools, and the ploughshares, and the trident, and the axes, and the setting of the goad." &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; is to be regarded as a nom. comp. like our trident, denoting an instrument with three prongs, according to the Chaldee and the Rabbins (see Ges. Thes. p. 1219). &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;, stimulus, is probably a pointed instrument generally, since the meaning goad is fully established in the case of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>.<p>(Note: <a href="/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a> runs very differently in the lxx, namely, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#894; and Thenius and Bttcher propose an emendation of the Hebrew text accordingly, so as to obtain the following meaning: "And the sharpening of the edges in the case of the spades and ploughshares was done at three shekels a tooth (i.e., three shekels each), and for the axe and sickle it was the same" (Thenius); or, "and the same for the sickles, and for the axes, and for setting the prong" (Bttcher). But here also it is easy enough to discover that the lxx had not another text before them that was different from the Masoretic text, but merely confounded &#1492;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1492;&#1489;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and took &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, which was unintelligible to them, e conjectura for &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, altogether regardless of the sense or nonsense of their own translation.
