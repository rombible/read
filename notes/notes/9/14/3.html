The destruction of Shiloh, the death of the high priest, the fall of Phinehas and his brother in battle, the melancholy circumstances of the birth of I-chabod, were still fresh in the memory of the people. Well might Jonathan be ready to sacrifice himself if he could deal an effectual blow upon these hereditary enemies of his country. Of this high priest Ahiah we never hear again in these Books of Samuel. He is generally supposed to be the same as the high priest Ahimelech, who was subsequently murdered by Doeg, by the direction of Saul, with the priests at Nob (<a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm" title="Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.">1Samuel 22:9</a>, &c.). The name Ahiah signifies “brother,” or “friend of the Eternal”; Ahimelech, “brother of the king,” may be another form of the same name.<p><span class= "bld">Wearing an ephod.</span>—The ephod here alluded to is not the ordinary priestly vestment of white linen, but that official garment worn alone by the high priest, in which was the breast-plate of gems with the mysterious Urim and Thummim, by which inquiry used to be made of the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm" title="And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.

Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance. Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whether "Ahiah" or "Ahijah" is the same person as "Ahimelech the son of Ahitub" (see the marginal reference), or whether Ahimelech was the brother or son of Ahijah, and his successor in the priesthood, it is impossible to say certainly. Most probably "Ahijah" and "Ahimilech" are variations of the same name; the latter element in each alone being different, &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;  melek (king) being substituted for the divine name &#1497;&#1492;  ya&#770;hh.

The grandson of Phinehas, the son of Eli, was now High Priest; and Samuel, who was probably a few years older than Ahitub the son of Phinehas, was now an old man. All this indicates a period of about 50 years or upward from the taking of the ark by the Philistines.<p>The Lord's priest in Shiloh - But as Eli was so emphatically known and described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1-4</a>, as God's Priest at Shiloh, and as there is every reason to believe that Shiloh was no longer the seat of the ark in Saul's time (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-3.htm">1 Chronicles 13:3-5</a>), it is better to refer these words to Eli, and not to Ahijah, to whom the next words, "wearing an ephod," apply.

It is interesting to find the house of Eli recovering at last from its disaster, and one of its members duly ministering in his office before the king. It has been debated whether he was the same person as Ahimelech, mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>, etc., the supposition being grounded on the fact that Ahiah is never spoken of again. But he may have died; and with regard to the argument drawn from the similarity of the names, we must notice that names compounded with <span class="accented">Ah</span> (or Ach), brother, were common in Eli's family, while compounds with <span class="accented">Ab</span>, father, were most in use among Saul's relatives. Ahiah or Ahijah means <span class="accented">Jah is brother</span>; his father is Ahitub, <span class="accented">the brother is good</span>; why should he not call another son Ahimelech, <span class="accented">the brother is king?</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah's priest in Shiloh.</span> This refers to Eli, the regular rule in Hebrew being that all such statements belong, not to the son, but to the father. <span class="cmt_word">Wearing an ephod.</span> Literally, ephod bearing. The ephod, as we have seen on 1 Samuel 2:18, was the usual ministerial garment; but what is meant here is not an ordinary ephod of linen, but that described in <a href="/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7, 8</a>, <span class="accented">wherein was the breastplate, by which Jehovah's will was made known to his people, until prophecy took its place. All this, the former part of the verse, must be regarded as a parenthesis. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Israelites could not offer a successful resistance to these devastating raids, as there was no smith to be found in the whole land: "For the Philistines thought the Hebrews might make themselves sword or spear" (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; followed by &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, "to say, or think, that not," equivalent to being unwilling that it should be done). Consequently (as the words clearly imply) when they proceeded to occupy the land of Israel as described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, they disarmed the people throughout, i.e., as far as they penetrated, and carried off the smiths, who might have been able to forge weapons; so that, as is still further related in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20</a>, all Israel was obliged to go to the Philistines, every one to sharpen his edge-tool, and his ploughshare, and his axe, and his chopper. According to <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>, &#1488;&#1514; is an iron instrument used in agriculture; the majority of the ancient versions render it ploughshare. The word &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; is striking after the previous &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; (from &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;); and the meaning of both words is uncertain. According to the etymology, &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; might denote any kind of edge-tool, even the ploughshare. The second &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; is rendered &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (his sickle) by the lxx, and sarculum by Jerome, a small garden hoe for loosening and weeding the soil. The fact that the word is connected with &#1511;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, the axe or hatchet, favours the idea that it signifies a hoe or spade rather than a sickle. Some of the words in <a href="/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a> are still more obscure. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, which is the reading adopted by all the earlier translators, indicates that the result is about to be given of the facts mentioned before: "And there came to pass," i.e., so that there came to pass (or arose), &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, "a blunting of the edges." &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, bluntness, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;, to tear, hence to make blunt, is confirmed by the Arabic futa&#770;r, gladius fissuras habens, obtusus ensis, whereas the meaning to hammer, i.e., to sharpen by hammering, cannot be established. The insertion of the article before &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is as striking as the omission of it before &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; also the stat. abs. instead of the construct &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;&#1514;. These anomalies render it a very probable conjecture that the reading may have been &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; (inf. Hiph. nomin.). Accordingly the rendering would be, "so that bluntness of the edges occurred in the edge-tools, and the ploughshares, and the trident, and the axes, and the setting of the goad." &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; is to be regarded as a nom. comp. like our trident, denoting an instrument with three prongs, according to the Chaldee and the Rabbins (see Ges. Thes. p. 1219). &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1503;, stimulus, is probably a pointed instrument generally, since the meaning goad is fully established in the case of &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>.<p>(Note: <a href="/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a> runs very differently in the lxx, namely, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#894; and Thenius and Bttcher propose an emendation of the Hebrew text accordingly, so as to obtain the following meaning: "And the sharpening of the edges in the case of the spades and ploughshares was done at three shekels a tooth (i.e., three shekels each), and for the axe and sickle it was the same" (Thenius); or, "and the same for the sickles, and for the axes, and for setting the prong" (Bttcher). But here also it is easy enough to discover that the lxx had not another text before them that was different from the Masoretic text, but merely confounded &#1492;&#1508;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; with &#1492;&#1489;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512;, &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, and took &#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, which was unintelligible to them, e conjectura for &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;, altogether regardless of the sense or nonsense of their own translation. The latest supporters of this senseless rendering, however, have neither undertaken to prove the possibility of translating &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;), "each single piece" (i.e., each), or inquired into the value of money at that time, so as to see whether three shekels would be an unexampled charge for the sharpening of an axe or sickle.) </body></html>
