It was a rough expedient, but it showed the wild soldiers that their king and general determined that the Law of Moses should be kept and honoured, even under circumstances of the direst necessity. This scrupulous care for the “Law of the Lord” at such a time as the evening of the battle of Michmash shows us what a strange complex character was Saul’s: now superstitiously watchful lest the letter of the Law should be broken; now recklessly careless whether or not the most solemn commands of God were executed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/14-33.htm" title="Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood.

Such is the nature of our bodies, that daily work cannot be done without daily bread, which therefore our Father in heaven graciously gives.

And the people flew upon the spoil&#8212;at evening, when the time fixed by Saul had expired. Faint and famishing, the pursuers fell voraciously upon the cattle they had taken, and threw them on the ground to cut off their flesh and eat them raw, so that the army, by Saul's rashness, were defiled by eating blood, or living animals; probably, as the Abyssinians do, who cut a part of the animal's rump, but close the hide upon it, and nothing mortal follows from that wound. They were painfully conscientious in keeping the king's order for fear of the curse, but had no scruple in transgressing God's command. To prevent this violation of the law, Saul ordered a large stone to be rolled, and those that slaughtered the oxen to cut their throats on that stone. By laying the animal's head on the high stone, the blood oozed out on the ground, and sufficient evidence was afforded that the ox or sheep was dead before it was attempted to eat it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He sees their fault, but not his own, in giving the occasion to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Roll a great stone unto me; </span> that the cattle might be all killed in one place, under the inspection of Saul, or some other appointed by him for that work; and upon the stone, that the blood may sooner and better flow out. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then they told Saul,....

The purpose of this stone was to raise up the caresses of the slaughtered animals from the ground, so that the blood might drain away from them.
