Those can never think themselves safe who see themselves out of God's protection. Now he sent for a priest and the ark. He hopes to make up matters with the Almighty by a partial reformation, as many do whose hearts are unhumbled and unchanged. Many love to have ministers who prophesy smooth things to them. Jonathan felt a Divine impulse and impression, putting him upon this bold adventure. God will direct the steps of those that acknowledge him in all their ways, and seek to him for direction, with full purpose of heart to follow his guidance. Sometimes we find most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we have been led by the unexpected but well-observed turns of Divine providence. There was trembling in the host. It is called a trembling of God, signifying, not only a great trembling they could not resist, nor reason themselves out of, but that it came at once from the hand of God. He that made the heart, knows how to make it tremble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Though it is not expressly said, as in the case of Gideon <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, Othniel <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>, and others, that the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, yet the whole course of the narrative, especially <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13-16</a>, indicates an extraordinary divine interposition.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Between the passes, through which Jonathan endeavoured to cross over to go up to the post of the Philistines, there was a sharp rock on this side, and also one upon the other. One of these was called Bozez, the other Seneh; one (formed) a pillar (&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;), i.e., a steep height towards the north opposite to Michmash, the other towards the south opposite to Geba. The expression "between the passes" may be explained from the remark of Robinson quoted above, viz., that at the point where he passed the Wady Suweinit, side wadys enter it from the south-west and north-west. These side wadys supply so many different crossings. Between them, however, on the north and south walls of the deep valley, were the jagged rocks Bozez and Seneh, which rose up like pillars to a great height. These were probably the "hills" which Robinson saw to the left of the pass by which he crossed: "Two hills of a conical or rather spherical form, having steep rocky sides, with small wadys running up behind so as almost to isolate them. One is on the side towards Jeba, and the other towards Mukhmas" (Pal. ii. p. 116).</body></html>
