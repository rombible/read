Weak and over-indulgent to his headstrong, wicked sons, probably too self-indulgent, and a lover of ease, yet in the brief record we possess we catch eight of not a few noble thoughts and wishes: flashes of true nobility, real generosity and self-forgetfulness, of intense, devoted patriotism, light up a life which closed in failure and disaster. Here the old man is quick to see that he had been insulting a blameless woman, so at once he retracts his cruel accusation, and silently accuses himself of precipitancy and injustice in his graceful, courteous words of farewell; adding too his fatherly wish, he almost promises that what she wished so ardently should be hers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/1-17.htm" title="Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him....">1 Samuel 1:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Eli said, Go in peace, </span>&c. — Her modest and respectful answer fully satisfied him, and he prayed that God would grant her petition, or, as the Chaldee interprets his words, assured her, that the God of Israel would grant it her. <span class="ital">Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That favourable opinion and gracious prayer which thou hast expressed on my behalf, be pleased to continue toward me. <span class="ital">Her countenance was no more sad — </span>Her heart being cheered by the priest’s comfortable words, and especially by the Spirit of God applying them to her mind, and inspiring her with confidence, that both his and her prayers would be heard, she departed from the tabernacle with such satisfaction and assurance, that there no longer remained any token of sorrow or grief in her countenance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-18 Hannah mingled tears with her prayers; she considered the mercy of our God, who knows the troubled soul. God gives us leave, in prayer, not only to ask good things in general, but to mention that special good thing we most need and desire. She spoke softly, none could hear her. Hereby she testified her belief of God's knowledge of the heart and its desires. Eli was high priest, and judge in Israel. It ill becomes us to be rash and hasty in censures of others, and to think people guilty of bad things while the matter is doubtful and unproved. Hannah did not retort the charge, and upbraid Eli with the wicked conduct of his own sons. When we are at any time unjustly censured, we have need to set a double watch before the door of our lips, that we do not return censure for censure. Hannah thought it enough to clear herself, and so must we. Eli was willing to acknowledge his mistake. Hannah went away with satisfaction of mind. She had herself by prayer committed her case to God, and Eli had prayed for her. Prayer is heart's ease to a gracious soul. Prayer will smooth the countenance; it should do so. None will long remain miserable, who use aright the privilege of going to the mercy-seat of a reconciled God in Christ Jesus.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/1_samuel/1-2.htm">1 Samuel 1:2</a> and note.

Eli marked her mouth&#8212;The suspicion of the aged priest seems to indicate that the vice of intemperance was neither uncommon nor confined to one sex in those times of disorder. This mistaken impression was immediately removed, and, in the words, "God grant," or rather, "will grant," was followed by an invocation which, as Hannah regarded it in the light of a prophecy pointing to the accomplishment of her earnest desire, dispelled her sadness, and filled her with confident hope [1Sa 1:18].

"After the eating at Shiloh, and after the drinking," i.e., after the sacrificial meal was over, Hannah rose up with a troubled heart, to pour out her grief in prayer before God, whilst Eli was sitting before the door-posts of the palace of Jehovah, and vowed this vow: "Lord of Zebaoth, if Thou regardest the distress of Thy maiden, and givest men's seed to Thy maiden, I will give him to the Lord all his life long, and no razor shall come upon his head." The choice of the infinitive absolute &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492; instead of the infinitive construct is analogous to the combination of two nouns, the first of which is defined by a suffix, and the second written absolutely (see e.g., &#1493;&#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>; cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-5.htm">2 Samuel 23:5</a>, and Ewald, 339, b). The words from &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; onwards to &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1512;&#1514; form two circumstantial clauses inserted in the main sentence, to throw light upon the situation and the further progress of the affair. The tabernacle is called "the palace of Jehovah" (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>), not on account of the magnificence and splendour of the building, but as the dwelling-place of Jehovah of hosts, the God-king of Israel, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a>, etc. &#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; is probably a porch, which had been placed before the curtain that formed the entranced into the holy place, when the tabernacle was erected permanently at Shiloh. &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, troubled in soul (cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-27.htm">2 Kings 4:27</a>). &#1514;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1499;&#1492; is really subordinate to &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, in the sense of "weeping much during her prayer." The depth of her trouble was also manifest in the crowding together of the words in which she poured out the desire of her heart before God: "If Thou wilt look upon the distress of Thine handmaid, and remember and not forget," etc. "Men's seed" (semen virorum), i.e., a male child. &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is the plural of &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, a man (see Ewald, 186-7), from the root &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, which combines the two ideas of fire, regarded as life, and giving life and firmness. The vow contained two points: (1) she would give the son she had prayed for to be the Lord's all the days of his life, i.e., would dedicate him to the Lord for a lifelong service, which, as we have already observed at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, the Levites as such were not bound to perform; and (2) no razor should come upon his head, by which he was set apart as a Nazarite for his whole life (see at <a href="/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2</a>., and <a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>). The Nazarite, again, was neither bound to perform a lifelong service nor to remain constantly at the sanctuary, but was simply consecrated for a certain time, whilst the sacrifice offered at his release from the vow shadowed forth a complete surrender to the Lord. The second point, therefore, added a new condition to the first, and one which was not necessarily connected with it, but which first gave the true consecration to the service of the Lord at the sanctuary. At the same time, the qualification of Samuel for priestly functions, such as the offering of sacrifice, can neither be deduced from the first point in the vow, nor yet from the second. If, therefore, at a later period, when the Lord had called him to be a prophet, and had thereby placed him at the head of the nation, Samuel officiated at the presentation of sacrifice, he was not qualified to perform this service either as a Levite or as a lifelong Nazarite, but performed it solely by virtue of his prophetic calling. </body></html>
