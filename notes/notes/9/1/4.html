If the devotions of a family prevail not to put an end to its divisions, yet let not the divisions put a stop to the devotions. To abate our just love to any relation for the sake of any infirmity which they cannot help, and which is their affliction, is to make God's providence quarrel with his precept, and very unkindly to add affliction to the afflicted. It is evidence of a base disposition, to delight in grieving those who are of a sorrowful spirit, and in putting those out of humour who are apt to fret and be uneasy. We ought to bear one another's burdens, not add to them. Hannah could not bear the provocation. Those who are of a fretful spirit, and are apt to lay provocations too much to heart, are enemies to themselves, and strip themselves of many comforts both of life and godliness. We ought to notice comforts, to keep us from grieving for crosses. We should look at that which is for us, as well as what is against us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is likely that during the unsettled times of the Judges Jdg 21:25 the attendance of Israelites at the three Festivals <a href="/exodus/34-23.htm">Exodus 34:23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a> fell into desuetude or great irregularity, and this one feast (see the marginal reference), which may have coincided with the Feast of Pentecost or tabernacles, may have been substituted for them.<p>The Lord of Hosts - This title of Yahweh which, with some variations, is found upward of 260 times in the Old Testament, occurs here for the first time. The meaning of the word "hosts" is doubtless the same as that of "army" <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a> and includes all the myriads of holy Angels who people the celestial spheres <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>. It is probably with reference to the idolatrous worship of the Host of heaven that the title the "Lord of Hosts" was given to the true God, as asserting His universal supremacy (see <a href="/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>). In the New Testament the phrase only occurs once <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>.<p>And the two sons ... - It should be, "and there the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the Lord," i. e. performed the functions of priests, in the old age of Eli <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-18.htm">1 Samuel 4:18</a>, who is represented <a href="/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a> as sitting on a seat in the temple. The reading of the Greek Version "Eli was there, and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord," is quite unnecessary, and indeed destroys the sense. The information here given concerning the sons of Eli is followed up in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a> ff. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. when &#8230; Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah &#8230; portions&#8212;The offerer received back the greater part of the peace offerings, which he and his family or friends were accustomed to eat at a social feast before the Lord. (See on [230]Le 3:3; [231]De 12:12). It was out of these consecrated viands Elkanah gave portions to all the members of his family; but "unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion"; that is, a larger choice, according to the Eastern fashion of showing regard to beloved or distinguished guests.

The genealogy only goes back as far as Perez, because he was the founder of the family of Judah which was named after him (<a href="/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20</a>), and to which Elimelech and Boaz belonged. Perez, a son of Judah by Tamar (<a href="/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29</a>), begat Hezrom, who is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a> among the sons of Judah who emigrated with Jacob into Egypt, although (as we have shown in our comm. on the passage) he was really born in Egypt. Of this son Ram (called Aram in the Sept. Cod. Al., and from that in <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>) nothing further is known, as he is only mentioned again in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>. His son Amminidab was the father-in-law of Aaron, who had married his daughter (<a href="/exodus/6-23.htm">Exodus 6:23</a>), and the father of Nahesson (Nahshon), the tribe-prince of the house of Judah in the time of Moses (<a href="/numbers/1-7.htm">Numbers 1:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>). According to this there are only four or five generations to the 430 years spent by the Israelites in Egypt, if we include both Perez and Nahesson; evidently not enough for so long a time, so that some of the intermediate links must have been left out even here. But the omission of unimportant members becomes still more apparent in the statement which follows, viz., that Nahshon begat Salmah, and Salmah Boaz, in which only two generations are given for a space of more than 250 years, which intervened between the death of Moses and the time of Gideon. Salmah (&#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;,   <a href="/1_chronicles/2-11.htm">1 Chronicles 2:11</a>) is called Salmon in <a href="/ruth/4-21.htm">Ruth 4:21</a>; a double form of the name, which is to be explained form the fact that Salmah grew out of Salmon through the elision of the n, and that the terminations an and on are used promiscuously, as we may see from the form &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="/job/41-18.htm">Job 41:18</a> when compared with &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-5.htm">1 Samuel 17:5</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38</a> (see Ewald, 163-4). According to the genealogy of Christ in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>, Salmon married Rahab; consequently he was a son, or at any rate a grandson, of Nahshon, and therefore all the members between Salmon and Boaz have been passed over. Again, the generations from Boaz to David (<a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-21.htm">Ruth 4:21</a>, <a href="/ruth/4-22.htm">Ruth 4:22</a>) may possibly be complete, although in all probability one generation has been passed over even here between Obed and Jesse. It is also worthy of notice that the whole chain from Perez to David consists of ten links, five of which (from Perez to Nahshon) belong to the 430 years of the sojourn in Egypt, and five (from Salmon to David) to the 476 years between the exodus from Egypt and the death of David. This symmetrical division is apparently as intentional as the limitation of the whole genealogy to ten members, for the purpose of stamping upon it through the number ten as the seal of completeness the character of a perfect, concluded, and symmetrical whole.<p>The genealogy closes with David, an evident proof that the book was intended to give a family picture form the life of the pious ancestors of this great and godly king of Israel. But for us the history which points to David acquires a still higher signification, from the fact that all the members of the genealogy of David whose names occur here are also found in the genealogy of Jesus Christ. "The passage is given by Matthew word for word in the genealogy of Christ, that we may see that this history looks not so much to David as to Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed by all as the Saviour and Redeemer of the human race, and that we may learn with what wonderful compassion the Lord raises up the lowly and despised to the greatest glory and majesty" (Brentius).</body></html>
