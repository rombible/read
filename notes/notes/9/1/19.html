Prayer and provender do not hinder a journey. When men are in such haste to set out upon journeys, or to engage in business, that they have not time to worship God, they are likely to proceed without his presence and blessing. Hannah, though she felt a warm regard for the courts of God's house, begged to stay at home. God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Those who are detained from public ordinances, by the nursing and tending of little children, may take comfort from this instance, and believe, that if they do that duty in a right spirit, God will graciously accept them therein. Hannah presented her child to the Lord with a grateful acknowledgment of his goodness in answer to prayer. Whatever we give to God, it is what we have first asked and received from him. All our gifts to him were first his gifts to us. The child Samuel early showed true piety. Little children should be taught to worship God when very young. Their parents should teach them in it, bring them to it, and put them on doing it as well as they can; God will graciously accept them, and will teach them to do better.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A beautiful example of the composing influence of prayer. Hannah had cast her burden upon the Lord, and so her own spirit was relieved of its load. She now returned to the family feast, and ate her portion with a cheerful heart. <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46-47</a>.<p>The word "sad" is not in the Hebrew text, but it fairly supplies the meaning intended. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-18. Eli marked her mouth&#8212;The suspicion of the aged priest seems to indicate that the vice of intemperance was neither uncommon nor confined to one sex in those times of disorder. This mistaken impression was immediately removed, and, in the words, "God grant," or rather, "will grant," was followed by an invocation which, as Hannah regarded it in the light of a prophecy pointing to the accomplishment of her earnest desire, dispelled her sadness, and filled her with confident hope [1Sa 1:18].

Abarbinel thinks that Elkanah had two houses, one at Ramah for Peninnah, and another at Ramatha for Hannah; and that this was Hannah's house, to which they returned and came: <p>and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife: cohabited with her as a man with his wife; it is a modest expression of the conjugal act; see <a href="/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a> and is observed to show that the conception and birth of Samuel were not in a supernatural way, but in the ordinary way and manner of generation: <p>and the Lord remembered her; the prayer she had made to him, opened her womb, as he had before shut it, and gave her power to conceive. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> remembered her.</span><p>(g) According to her petition.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">the</span> Lord <span class="ital">remembered her</span>] Cp. <a href="/genesis/30-22.htm" title="And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.">Genesis 30:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They rose up.</span> After solemn worship early the next morning Elkanah returned to his home at Ramah, and God answered Hannah's prayer, and gave her the wished for son. She calls him Samuel, lit. Shemuel (<a href="/numbers/34-20.htm">Numbers 34:20</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a>), which was an ordinary Hebrew name, and means "heard of God," not "asked of God," as in the margin of the A.V. It seems to have been the mother's right to give names to her children (<a href="/luke/1-60.htm">Luke 1:60</a>), and Hannah saw in Samuel, whom she had asked of God, a living proof that she had been heard by him. The name, therefore, is of fuller significance than the reason given for it. Ishmael has virtually the same meaning, signifying "God heareth."
