The words signify David himself. If God’s anger for the broken vow visited even David’s enemies, as distantly connected with him, how much more the guilty oath breaker himself? (This was Raschi’s explanation for a similar expression in Jonathan’s oath, <a href="/1_samuel/20-16.htm" title="So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.">1Samuel 20:16</a>.) “A superstitious feeling probably lay at the root of this substitution of David’s enemies for himself, when thus invoking a curse” (Dean Payne Smith, in the <span class= "ital">Pulpit Commentary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Bishop Wordsworth here draws a good lesson on the non-obligation to keep a solemn oath, taken perhaps in a moment of undue excitement, and instances the evil example of Herod Antipas, who considered himself bound to carry out to the bitter end his rash oath to the daughter of Herodias, though it involved the death of John the Baptist, his former friend.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/25-22.htm" title="So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that urinates against the wall.">1 Samuel 25:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">So and more also do God unto the enemies of David — </span>That is, unto David himself.

The meaning seems to be, that he wishes God might bless his enemies, and pour evil upon himself, if he did not destroy Nabal and all the males of his family before the morning. But is this the voice of David? Can he speak so unadvisedly with his lips? Has he been so long in the school of affliction, and learned no more patience therein? Lord, <span class="ital">what is man? </span>And what need have we to pray, <span class="ital">Lead us not into temptation! </span>David’s wrath, though perhaps justly moved, here carried him to a pitch that, if executed, would have filled him with remorse, sorrow, and shame, as it could by no means have been reconciled to the laws of that God who was his defender, and whom alone he confided in for support under, and deliverance out of, his troubles. In which laws, too, he was well instructed, and therefore ought to have been governed by them, and not by his furious resentment.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:18-31 By a present Abigail atoned for Nabal's denial of David's request. Her behaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. She puts herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She could not excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her own reasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that grace would work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeance on so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him no kindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end of David's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore it becomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives of any, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keeps this argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; that the less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace and the repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, which they have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness. When tempted to sin, we should consider how it will appear when we think upon it afterwards.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The concluding phrase denotes the utter destruction of a family, and is rightly explained to mean "every male," perhaps with the idea, "down to the very meanest member of the household." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you&#8212;People in the East always try to produce an effect by their presents, loading on several beasts what might be easily carried by one, and bringing them forward, article by article, in succession.

This must be imputed to the sudden and violent passion David was thrown into when off his guard, through the necessity he was in, the disappointment he met with, and the opprobrious language he was treated with; but in this his conduct was not as it used to be, and as it was towards Saul his enemy. Nor is his rage and passion to be vindicated, or the rash vow he made to destroy Nabal and his family; his crime, though great, yet not to be published with death; his ingratitude and insolence deserved resentment, but were not capital crimes worthy of death, and especially of the destruction of his whole family; the Jews indeed make him to be guilty of treason, in that he knew that David was anointed king, and yet both abused him, and disobeyed his commands, and therefore being guilty of overt acts of treason, he and his were deserving of death; but David was not yet king. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that <i>pertain</i> to him by the morning light any that <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> pisseth against the wall.</span><p>(h) Meaning by this proverb that he would destroy both small and great.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">unto the enemies of David</span>] In the usual oath-formula the swearer invokes divine vengeance upon himself (<a href="/1_samuel/20-13.htm" title="The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.">1 Samuel 20:13</a>), or upon the person adjured (<a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm" title="And he said, What is the thing that the LORD has said to you?

But the Lord preserved him from this sin by the fact that, just at the right time, Abigail, the intelligent and pious wife of Nabal, heard of the affair, and was able to appease the wrath of David by her immediate and kindly interposition.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14-16</a><p>Abigail heard from one of (Nabal's) servants what had taken place (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, to wish any one prosperity and health, i.e., to salute, as in <a href="/1_samuel/13-10.htm">1 Samuel 13:10</a>; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1496;, from &#1506;&#1497;&#1496;, to speak wrathfully: on the form, see at <a href="/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>), and also what had been praiseworthy in the behaviour of David's men towards Nabal's shepherds; how they had not only done them no injury, had not robbed them of anything, but had defended them all the while.
