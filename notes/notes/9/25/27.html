Her behaviour was very submissive. Yielding pacifies great offences. She puts herself in the place of a penitent, and of a petitioner. She could not excuse her husband's conduct. She depends not upon her own reasonings, but on God's grace, to soften David, and expects that grace would work powerfully. She says that it was below him to take vengeance on so weak and despicable an enemy as Nabal, who, as he would do him no kindness, so he could do him no hurt. She foretells the glorious end of David's present troubles. God will preserve thy life; therefore it becomes not thee unjustly and unnecessarily to take away the lives of any, especially of the people of thy God and Saviour. Abigail keeps this argument for the last, as very powerful with so good a man; that the less he indulged his passion, the more he consulted his peace and the repose of his own conscience. Many have done that in a heat, which they have a thousand times wished undone again. The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness.

God do so to the enemies of David, if I leave, etc.; i.e., "as truly as God will punish the enemies of David, so certainly will I not leave till the morning light, of all that belongeth to him, one that pisseth against the wall." This oath, in which the punishment of God is not called down upon the swearer himself (God do so to me), as it generally is, but upon the enemies of David, is analogous to that in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>, where punishment is threatened upon the person addressed, who is there made to swear; except that here, as the oath could not be uttered in the ears of the person addressed, upon whom it was to fall, the enemies generally are mentioned instead of "to thee." There is no doubt, therefore, as to the correctness of the text. The substance of this imprecation may be explained from the fact that David is so full of the consciousness of fighting and suffering for the cause of the kingdom of God, that he discerns in the insult heaped upon him by Nabal an act of hostility to the Lord and the cause of His kingdom. The phrase &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, mingens in parietem, is only met with in passages which speak of the destruction of a family or household to the very last man (viz., besides this passage, <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-11.htm">1 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8</a>), and neither refers primarily to dogs, as Ephraem Syrus, Juda ben Karish, and others maintain; nor to the lowest class of men, as Winer, Maurer, and others imagine; nor to little boys, as L. de Dieu, Gesenius, etc., suppose; but, as we may see from the explanatory clause appended to <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8</a>, to every male (quemcumque masculi generis hominem: vid., Bochart, Hieroz. i. pp. 776ff., and Rdiger on Ges.
