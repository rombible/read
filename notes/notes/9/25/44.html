This high-handed act showed on the part of Saul a fixed determination to break utterly and for ever with David. Phalti was presumably a chieftain whom Saul was desirous of attracting to his fortunes. But the story of Miehal does not end here. After King Saul’s death, Abner, the uncle (or perhaps the cousin) of the late king, the well-known captain of his host, made overtures to David. David, however, only consented to a friendship with Abner if his young kins woman, the Princess Miehal, Saul’s daughter, was taken away from Phalti, and restored to him as his wife. Abner, we read, complied with the condition, and Miehal was taken from Phaltiel—as he is called in the account of this transaction, contained in <a href="/2_samuel/3-13.htm" title="And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.">2Samuel 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-16.htm" title="And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.">2Samuel 3:16</a>—and restored to David. An interesting and curious tradition respecting this man Phalti, or Phaltiel, is contained in the Talmud. In <a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a> the second husband of David’s wife is called Phalti, and in <a href="/2_samuel/3-15.htm" title="And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.">2Samuel 3:15</a> he is called Phaltiel. Rabbi Jochanan said his name received that extension (el=God) to indicate that <span class= "ital">God </span>had <span class= "ital">saved </span>him from transgression. (The name <span class= "ital">Phalti </span>being derived from the root <span class= "ital">palat—</span>to cause to escape, Michal and Phalti never having lived together as man and wife.)—Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 19, Colossians 2.<p>Once more the daughter of Saul appears in the sacred history. (See <a href="/context/2_samuel/6-20.htm" title="Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!">2Samuel 6:20-23</a>.) It was the greatest day in David’s life—the Ark of the Covenant was being brought up with solemn pomp from its place of long exile in Kirjath-jearim to the new sacred capital of the loved king. One sad incident alone, we are told, marred the glories of the day. Michal, his wife, as Stanley thinks, in the proud, almost conservative, spirit of the older dynasty, not without a thought of her father’s fallen house, looked on contemptuously as King David danced before the Ark with the priests, his royal robes thrown aside; and later in the day seems to have poured out before the king her scornful feelings.<p>“Preceding the blest vessel, onward came,<p>With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,<p>Israel’s sweet harper; in that hap he seemed<p>Less and yet more kingly. Opposite,<p>At a great palace, from the lattice forth<p>Looked Miehal, like a lady full of scorn<p>And sorrow.”—DANTE: <span class= "ital">Purgatory, </span>10<p>The sacred story goes on to say that Michal, as a childless wife in the royal palace of David, had time to mourn her fatal exhibition of pride. (See <a href="/context/2_samuel/6-12.htm" title="And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.">2Samuel 6:12-23</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:39-44 Abigail believed that David would be king over Israel, and greatly esteemed his pious and excellent character.
