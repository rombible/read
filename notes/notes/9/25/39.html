David's conduct shows that the manners of the Eastern nations were already imitated by the great men in Israel; and that the morality of the times which God permitted, gave its sanction to the practice of polygamy.

Yet it may be further said, that this was not purely an act of private revenge, because David was a public person, and anointed king; and therefore Nabal’s reproach cast upon David above, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1 Samuel 25:10</a>,11</span>, was a contempt of God, and of his ordinance and appointment; which was vindicated by this remarkable judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hath kept his servant from evil, </span> i.e. from the sin of bloodshed and self-revenge, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/25-33.htm" title="And blessed be your advice, and blessed be you, which have kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand.">1 Samuel 25:33</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">David sent, </span> to wit, messengers; which he thought fitter than to go himself; partly because if he had met with a repulse, it had been less ignominious; and partly because he would leave her to her freedom and choice, and would not so much as seem to take her by violence. But this doubtless was not done immediately after Nabal’s death, but in some convenient space of time after it; though such circumstances be commonly omitted in the sacred history, which gives only the threads and most important passages of things. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when David heard that Nabal was dead,.... As he soon might, Maon and Carmel not being far from the wilderness where David was: <p>he said, blessed be the Lord, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal; not that he rejoiced at the death of Nabal, simply considered, or from a private spirit of revenge; but because of the glory of divine justice, which he had shown to him in vindicating him from the reproach Nabal had cast upon him, and particularly was thankful for what follows: <p>and hath kept his servant from evil; from slaying Nabal with his own hand, and doing hurt to his family: <p>for the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head; and upon no other, none of his family suffered but himself, and which was another cause of thankfulness to David; had he been suffered to have done as he in his wrath determined, not only Nabal, but all the males in his house, had been cut off; but now, through the righteous judgment of God, only Nabal suffered, and not any of his family: <p>and David sent and communed with Abigail; by his messengers to her; or "concerning" her (h), about marrying her: <p>to take her to him to wife; for being both a beautiful and wise woman, he thought her a proper person to be his wife; which she might lawfully become, Nabal being dead, and Michal, David's wife, being taken from him, and given to another man, with whom she lived in adultery; or as divorced by David, as the Jews say, David by the law of God was free from her. These messengers were sent by David at a convenient time, at a proper distance from the death of Nabal; and he chose rather to send messengers than to go himself, lest being denied he should be put to shame, she being a rich widow, and he a poor persecuted man, and that her answer might be entirely free and unawed by him, and that it might appear that she was not taken to him by force; and besides, such a method has been always reckoned most honourable with great personages. <p>(h) , Sept.

So God had avenged David, while preventing him by Abigail s interference from avenging himself (see <a href="/1_samuel/24-13.htm">1 Samuel 24:13</a>). As a widow's legal mourning seems to have lasted only seven days, David, on hearing of Nabal's death, sent messengers to Abigail at Carmel to ask her in marriage. He was probably moved to this not merely by her sensible conduct, but also by the news that Michal had been given to another. She expresses her willingness in true Oriental fashion by saying she was ready to perform the most abject menial duties, even for his servants, and at once with five maidens proceeds to join him. It is a proof that David considered himself practically secure against Saul's attempts that he thus married and allowed women to accompany his small force, as their presence would not only impede the rapidity of his movements, but also implies a certain amount of case and comfort for their maintenance.
