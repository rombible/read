He at other times was calm and considerate, but is put into such a heat by a few hard words, that he seeks to destroy a whole family.

The word &#1500;&#1495;&#1497; is obscure, and was interpreted by the early translators merely according to uncertain conjectures. The simplest explanation is apparently in vitam, long life, understood as a wish in the sense of "good fortune to you" (Luther, Maurer, etc.); although the word &#1495;&#1497; in the singular can only be shown to have the meaning life in connection with the formula used in oaths, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1495;&#1497;, etc. But even if &#1495;&#1497; must be taken as an adjective, it is impossible to explain &#1500;&#1495;&#1497; in any other way than as an elliptical exclamation meaning "good fortune to the living man." For the idea that the word is to be connected with &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, "say to the living man," i.e., to the man if still alive, is overthrown by the fact that David had no doubt that Nabal was still living. The words which follow are also to be understood as a wish, "May thou and thy house, and all that is thine, be well!" After this salutation they were to proceed with the object of their visit: "And now I have heard that thou hast sheep-shearers. Now thy shepherds have been with us; we have done them no harm (&#1492;&#1499;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a> : on the form, see Ges. 53, 3, Anm. 6), and nothing was missed by them so long as they were in Carmel." When living in the desert, David's men had associated with the shepherds of Nabal, rendered them various services, and protected them and their flocks against the southern inhabitants of the desert (the Bedouin Arabs); in return for which they may have given them food and information. Thus David proved himself a protector of his people even in his banishment. &#1493;&#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, "so may the young men (those sent by David) find favour in thine eyes! for we have come to a good (i.e., a festive) day. Give, I pray, what thy hand findeth (i.e., as much as thou canst) to thy servant, and to thy son David." With the expression "thy son" David claims Nabal's fatherly goodwill. So far as the fact itself is concerned, "on such a festive occasion near a town or village even in our own time, an Arab sheikh of the neighbouring desert would hardly fail to put in a word either in person or by message; and his message both in form and substance would be only the transcript of that of David" (Robinson, Palestine, p. 201).</body></html>
