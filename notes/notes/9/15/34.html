Samuel calls Agag to account for his own sins. He followed the example of his ancestors' cruelty, justly therefore is all the righteous blood shed by Amalek required. Saul seems unconcerned at the token of God's displeasure which he lay under, yet Samuel mourns day and night for him. Jerusalem was carnally secure while Christ wept over it. Do we desire to do the whole will of God? Turn to him, not in form and appearance, but with sincerity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hewed in pieces - Only found in this passage.

There is something awful in the majesty of the prophet rising above and eclipsing that of the king (compare <a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a> ff; <a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. Samuel hewed Agag&#8212;This cruel tyrant met the retribution of a righteous Providence. Never has it been unusual for great or official personages in the East to perform executions with their own hands. Samuel did it "before the Lord" in Gilgal, appointing that same mode of punishment (hitherto unknown in Israel) to be used towards him, which he had formerly used towards others.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Samuel went to Ramah,....

"Then Saul laid hold of the lappet of his mantle (i.e., his upper garment), and it tore" (lit. was torn off). That the Niphal &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; is correct, and is not to be altered into &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;, "Saul tore off the lappet," according to the rendering of the lxx, as Thenius supposes, is evident from the explanation which Samuel gave of the occurrence (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>): "Jehovah hath torn the sovereignty of Israel from thee to-day, and given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou." As Saul was about to hold back the prophet by force, that he might obtain from him a revocation of the divine sentence, the tearing of the mantle, which took place accidentally, and evidently without any such intention on the part of Saul, was to serve as a sign of the rending away of the sovereignty from him. Samuel did not yet know to whom Jehovah would give it; he therefore used the expression &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498;, as &#1512;&#1506; is applied to any one with whom a person associates. To confirm his own words, he adds in <a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a> : "And also the Trust of Israel doth not lie and doth not repent, for He is not a man to repent." &#1504;&#1510;&#1495; signifies constancy, endurance, then confidence, trust, because a man can trust in what is constant. This meaning is to be retained here, where the word is used as a name for God, and not the meaning gloria, which is taken in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a> from the Aramaean usage of speech, and would be altogether unsuitable here, where the context suggests the idea of unchangeableness. For a man's repentance or regret arises from his changeableness, from the fluctuations in his desires and actions. This is never the case with God; consequently He is &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, the unchangeable One, in whom Israel can trust, since He does not lie or deceive, or repent of His purposes. These words are spoken &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; (theomorphically), whereas in <a href="/1_samuel/15-11.htm">1 Samuel 15:11</a> and other passages, which speak of God as repenting, the words are to be understood &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; (anthropomorphically; cf. <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). </body></html>
