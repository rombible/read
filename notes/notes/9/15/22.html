The words of Samuel here were reproduced, or at least referred to, by other prophets and teachers of the old dispensation; for example, see <a href="/context/psalms/50-8.htm" title="I will not reprove you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.">Psalm 50:8-14</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/51-16.htm" title="For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.">Psalm 51:16-17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm" title="To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/context/micah/6-6.htm" title="With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>.

Obedience to God is a moral duty, constantly and indispensably necessary; but sacrifice is but a ceremonial institution, sometimes unnecessary, as it was in the wilderness; and sometimes sinful, when it is offered by a polluted hand, or in an irregular manner. Therefore thy gross disobedience to God’s express command is not to be compensated with sacrifice. <span class="ital">To hearken — </span>That is, to obey. <span class="ital">The fat of rams — </span>Then the choicest part of all the sacrifice. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:10-23 Repentance in God is not a change of mind, as it is in us, but a change of method. The change was in Saul; He is turned back from following me. Hereby he made God his enemy. Samuel spent a whole night in pleading for Saul. The rejection of sinners is the grief of believers: God delights not in their death, nor should we. Saul boasts to Samuel of his obedience. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, to escape being judged of the Lord. The noise the cattle made, like the rust of the silver, Jas 5:3, witnessed against him. Many boast of obedience to the command of God; but what means then their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the world, their angry and unkind spirit, and their neglect of holy duties, which witness against them? See of what evil covetousness is the root; and see what is the sinfulness of sin, and notice that in it which above any thing else makes it evil in the sight of the Lord; it is disobedience: Thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord. Carnal, deceitful hearts, like Saul, think to excuse themselves from God's commandments by what pleases themselves. It is hard to convince the children of disobedience. But humble, sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is more pleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offering and sacrifices. God is more glorified and self more denied, by obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or lamb to be burned upon the altar, than to bring every high thought into obedience to God, and to make our will subject to his will. Those are unfit and unworthy to rule over men, who are not willing that God should rule over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hath the Lord ... - A grand example of the moral and spiritual teaching of the prophets (see the marginal references).

Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord&#8212;Saul was either blinded by a partial and delusive self-love, or he was, in his declaration to Samuel, acting the part of a bold and artful hypocrite. He professed to have fulfilled the divine command, and that the blame of any defects in the execution lay with the people. Samuel saw the real state of the case, and in discharge of the commission he had received before setting out, proceeded to denounce his conduct as characterized by pride, rebellion, and obstinate disobedience. When Saul persisted in declaring that he had obeyed, alleging that the animals, whose bleating was heard, had been reserved for a liberal sacrifice of thanksgiving to God, his shuffling, prevaricating answer called forth a stern rebuke from the prophet. It well deserved it&#8212;for the destination of the spoil to the altar was a flimsy pretext&#8212;a gross deception, an attempt to conceal the selfishness of the original motive under the cloak of religious zeal and gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To obey is better than sacrifice, </span> because obedience to God is a moral duty, constantly and indispensably necessary; but sacrifice is but a ceremonial institution, sometimes unnecessary, as it was in the wilderness; and sometimes sinful, when it is offered by a polluted hand, or in an irregular manner; therefore thy gross disobedience to God’s express command is not to be compensated with sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To hearken, </span> i.e. to obey, as hearing is oft used in Scripture.

With a burst of prophetic inspiration Samuel rends asunder Saul’s tissue of excuses, and lays bare his sin. His words are the key-note of the long remonstrance of the prophets in subsequent ages against the too common error of supposing that external ceremonial can be of any value in the sight of God when separated from the true devotion of the worshipper’s heart which it symbolizes.

It asserts in the clearest terms the superiority of moral to ritual worship, and that God can only be really served with the heart. <span class="cmt_word">Witchcraft</span> is in the Hebrew <span class="accented">divination</span>, a sin always strongly condemned in the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">Iniquity</span> literally means <span class="accented">nothingness</span>, and so is constantly used for "an idol;" and this must be its signification here, as the word coupled with it, and rendered <span class="cmt_word">idolatry</span>, is really <span class="accented">teraphim.</span> These were the Hebrew household gods, answering to the Roman <span class="accented">Lares</span>, and were supposed to bring good luck. Their worship, we see from this place, was strictly forbidden. The verse, therefore, means, "For rebellion is the sin of divination (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> is equal to it in wickedness), and obstinacy (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> intractableness) is an idol and teraphim." Samuel thus accuses Saul of resistance to Jehovah's will, and of the determination at all hazards to be his own master. With this temper of mind he could be no fit representative of Jehovah, and therefore Samuel dethrones him. Henceforward he reigns only as a temporal, and no longer as the theocratic, king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel therefore bade him be silent. &#1492;&#1512;&#1507;, "leave off," excusing thyself any further. "I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night." (The Chethibh &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; is evidently a copyist's error for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;.) "Is it not true, when thou wast little in thine eyes (a reference to Saul's own words, <a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), thou didst become head of the tribes of Israel? and Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel, and Jehovah sent thee on the way, and said, Go and ban the sinners, the Amalekites, and make war against them, until thou exterminatest them. And wherefore hast thou nor hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and hast fallen upon the booty," etc.? (&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1496;, see at <a href="/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>.)<p>Even after this Saul wanted to justify himself, and to throw the blame of sparing the cattle upon the people. </body></html>
