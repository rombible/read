The change was in Saul; He is turned back from following me. Hereby he made God his enemy. Samuel spent a whole night in pleading for Saul. The rejection of sinners is the grief of believers: God delights not in their death, nor should we. Saul boasts to Samuel of his obedience. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, to escape being judged of the Lord. The noise the cattle made, like the rust of the silver, Jas 5:3, witnessed against him. Many boast of obedience to the command of God; but what means then their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the world, their angry and unkind spirit, and their neglect of holy duties, which witness against them? See of what evil covetousness is the root; and see what is the sinfulness of sin, and notice that in it which above any thing else makes it evil in the sight of the Lord; it is disobedience: Thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord. Carnal, deceitful hearts, like Saul, think to excuse themselves from God's commandments by what pleases themselves. It is hard to convince the children of disobedience. But humble, sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is more pleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offering and sacrifices. God is more glorified and self more denied, by obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or lamb to be burned upon the altar, than to bring every high thought into obedience to God, and to make our will subject to his will. Those are unfit and unworthy to rule over men, who are not willing that God should rule over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gilgal being within 15 miles of Ramah, Samuel might easily have come from Ramah that morning.

Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord&#8212;Saul was either blinded by a partial and delusive self-love, or he was, in his declaration to Samuel, acting the part of a bold and artful hypocrite. He professed to have fulfilled the divine command, and that the blame of any defects in the execution lay with the people. Samuel saw the real state of the case, and in discharge of the commission he had received before setting out, proceeded to denounce his conduct as characterized by pride, rebellion, and obstinate disobedience. When Saul persisted in declaring that he had obeyed, alleging that the animals, whose bleating was heard, had been reserved for a liberal sacrifice of thanksgiving to God, his shuffling, prevaricating answer called forth a stern rebuke from the prophet. It well deserved it&#8212;for the destination of the spoil to the altar was a flimsy pretext&#8212;a gross deception, an attempt to conceal the selfishness of the original motive under the cloak of religious zeal and gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How can this evidence of guilt consist with the profession of thy innocency? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Samuel said, what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears,....

"All," i.e., all that fell into the hands of the Israelites. For it follows from the very nature of the case that many escaped, and consequently there is nothing striking in the fact that Amalekites are mentioned again at a later period (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>). The last remnant was destroyed by the Simeonites upon the mountains of Seir in the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-43.htm">1 Chronicles 4:43</a>). Only, king Agag did Saul and the people (of Israel) spare, also "the best of the sheep and oxen, and the animals of the second birth, and the lambs and everything good; these they would not ban." &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, according to D. Kimchi and R. Tanch. , are &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., animalia secundo partu edita, which were considered superior to the others (vid., Roediger in Ges. Thes. p. 1451); and &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, pasture lambs, i.e., fat lambs. There is no necessity, therefore, for the conjecture of Ewald and Thenius, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, fattened, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, vineyards; nor for the far-fetched explanation given by Bochart, viz., camels with two humps and camel-saddles, to say nothing of the fact that camel-saddles and vineyards are altogether out of place here. In "all that was good" the things already mentioned singly are all included. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492;, the property; here it is applied to cattle, as in <a href="/genesis/33-14.htm">Genesis 33:14</a>. &#1504;&#1502;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492;  equals  &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492;, despised, undervalued. The form of the word is not contracted from a noun &#1502;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; and the participle &#1504;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492; (Ges. Lehrgeb. p. 463), but seems to be a participle Niph. formed from a noun &#1502;&#1489;&#1494;&#1492;. But as such a form is contrary to all analogy, Ewald and Olshausen regard the reading as corrupt. &#1504;&#1502;&#1505; (from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;): flowing away; used with reference to diseased cattle, or such as have perished. The reason for sparing the best cattle is very apparent, namely selfishness. But it is not so easy to determine why Agag should have been spared by Saul. It is by no means probable that he wished thereby to do honour to the royal dignity. O. v. Gerlach's supposition, that vanity or the desire to make a display with a royal slave was the actual reason, is a much more probable one. </body></html>
