It was the greatest of all the dangers to which Israel was exposed, and was in fact a tampering with the idol-worship of the surrounding nations. Impurity, and an utter lack of all the loftier principles of morality which the one true God and His chosen servants would impress on the peoples of the East, characterised the various systems of idol-worship then current in Syria and the adjacent countries. And Samuel here, in this solemn inspired saying, briefly gives the grounds of the Lord’s rejection of His Anointed: “Rebellion,” or conscious disobedience to the express commands of the Eternal, in the case of Saul, God’s chosen king, was nothing else than the deadly sin of idol-worship, for it set aside the true Master of Israel, and virtually acknowledged another. The next sentence still more emphatically expresses the same thought: “Stubbornness,” or “intractableness,” is in the eyes of the pure God the same thing as worshipping idols and teraphim. The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">aven, </span>rendered iniquity, literally signifies “nothingness;” it is a word used in the late prophets for an idol (<a href="/hosea/10-8.htm" title="The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.">Hosea 10:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-3.htm" title="He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.">Isaiah 66:3</a>). The word in the original translated in the English Version “idolatry,” is teraphim. Teraphim were apparently small household gods or idols, venerated as the arbiters of good and evil fortune. In Roman life we find similar idols under the name of “Lares.” Teraphim is derived from an unused root, <span class= "ital">taraph, </span>signifying “to live comfortably;” Arabic, <span class= "ital">tarafa: </span>compare the Sanscrit <span class= "ital">trip, </span>and the Greek <span class= "greekheb">τρέΦειν</span><span class= "ital">. </span>These idols appear to have been small human figures of various sizes. The image in <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm" title="And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.">1Samuel 19:13</a> was probably nearly life-size. These teraphim were made generally of silver or of wood. It has been suggested that the teraphim which Rachel stole were images of her ancestors. (See Note on <a href="/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>, and Mr. Whitelaw’s comment on <span class= "ital">ib. </span>in the <span class= "ital">Pulpit Commentary.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm" title="For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.

The meaning is, that as Saul had wilfully disobeyed the command of God, he was guilty of rebellion against him; and that wilful, peremptory disobedience to any command of God is, for the nature of it, a most heinous sin, though the matter in which it is manifested be ever so small. <span class="ital">The Lord hath rejected thee from being king — </span>That is, hath pronounced the sentence of rejection; for that he was not now actually deposed by God, plainly appears in that not only the people, but even David, after this, owned him as king. Indeed, he continued to be king till the day of his death. He was only actually rejected and deposed when he was slain in battle. But the expression may chiefly respect his posterity, to whom God would not suffer the kingdom to descend.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:10-23 Repentance in God is not a change of mind, as it is in us, but a change of method. The change was in Saul; He is turned back from following me. Hereby he made God his enemy. Samuel spent a whole night in pleading for Saul. The rejection of sinners is the grief of believers: God delights not in their death, nor should we. Saul boasts to Samuel of his obedience. Thus sinners think, by justifying themselves, to escape being judged of the Lord. The noise the cattle made, like the rust of the silver, Jas 5:3, witnessed against him. Many boast of obedience to the command of God; but what means then their indulgence of the flesh, their love of the world, their angry and unkind spirit, and their neglect of holy duties, which witness against them? See of what evil covetousness is the root; and see what is the sinfulness of sin, and notice that in it which above any thing else makes it evil in the sight of the Lord; it is disobedience: Thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord. Carnal, deceitful hearts, like Saul, think to excuse themselves from God's commandments by what pleases themselves. It is hard to convince the children of disobedience. But humble, sincere, and conscientious obedience to the will of God, is more pleasing and acceptable to him than all burnt-offering and sacrifices. God is more glorified and self more denied, by obedience than by sacrifice. It is much easier to bring a bullock or lamb to be burned upon the altar, than to bring every high thought into obedience to God, and to make our will subject to his will. Those are unfit and unworthy to rule over men, who are not willing that God should rule over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is "Rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and stubbornness is as bad as worshipping false gods (iniquity), and teraphim (idolatry)." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-23. Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord&#8212;Saul was either blinded by a partial and delusive self-love, or he was, in his declaration to Samuel, acting the part of a bold and artful hypocrite. He professed to have fulfilled the divine command, and that the blame of any defects in the execution lay with the people. Samuel saw the real state of the case, and in discharge of the commission he had received before setting out, proceeded to denounce his conduct as characterized by pride, rebellion, and obstinate disobedience. When Saul persisted in declaring that he had obeyed, alleging that the animals, whose bleating was heard, had been reserved for a liberal sacrifice of thanksgiving to God, his shuffling, prevaricating answer called forth a stern rebuke from the prophet. It well deserved it&#8212;for the destination of the spoil to the altar was a flimsy pretext&#8212;a gross deception, an attempt to conceal the selfishness of the original motive under the cloak of religious zeal and gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Rebellion, </span> i.e. disobedience to God’s express precept, which was Saul’s case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is as the sin of witchcraft; </span> is, though not so great, yet as inexcusable and impudent a sin as witchcraft; as plainly condemned, and as certainly destructive and damnable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Stubbornness; </span> either wilful and presumptuous sin, whereby a man violently breaks loose from God’s command, and resists his authority; or rather, perseverance or contumacy in sin, justifying it, and pleading for it, which was Saul’s present crime. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is as iniquity and idolatry, </span> or, <span class="ital">the iniquity of idolatry</span>; this being an <span class="ital">hendiadis</span>; as <span class="ital">judgment and justice</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm" title="Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.">Deu 16:18</a></span>, is put for <span class="ital">the judgment of justice</span>, or <span class="ital">just judgment</span>.
