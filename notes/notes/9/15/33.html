Samuel calls Agag to account for his own sins. He followed the example of his ancestors' cruelty, justly therefore is all the righteous blood shed by Amalek required. Saul seems unconcerned at the token of God's displeasure which he lay under, yet Samuel mourns day and night for him. Jerusalem was carnally secure while Christ wept over it.

There is something awful in the majesty of the prophet rising above and eclipsing that of the king (compare <a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a> ff; <a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. Samuel hewed Agag&#8212;This cruel tyrant met the retribution of a righteous Providence. Never has it been unusual for great or official personages in the East to perform executions with their own hands. Samuel did it "before the Lord" in Gilgal, appointing that same mode of punishment (hitherto unknown in Israel) to be used towards him, which he had formerly used towards others.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy sword hath made women childless; </span> whereby it appears that he was a cruel tyrant, and guilty of really bloody actions, and that towards God’s people, though it be not related elsewhere. And this seems to be added for the fuller vindication of God’s justice, and to show, that although God did at this time remember and revenge a crime committed by this man’s ancestors four hundred years ago, yet he did not punish an innocent son for his father’s crimes, but one that allowed and persisted in the same evil courses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Samuel hewed Agag in pieces</span> by Divine instinct, and in pursuance of God’s express and particular command, above, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm" title="Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.">1 Samuel 15:3</a></span>, which being sinfully neglected by Saul, is now executed by Samuel.

Or, "bereaved (s)" them, not of their children only, but of their husbands also, and so made them both childless and widows; by which it appears that he was a cruel prince, and justly died for his own barbarity and wickedness, as well as for the sins of his ancestors four hundred years ago: <p>so shall thy mother be childless among women; which was according to the law of retaliation, and what the Jews call measure for measure: <p>and Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal; either before the ark of the Lord, the symbol of the divine Presence; or before the altar, where Saul and the people had been sacrificing; this he did either himself, though an old man, or by others to whom he gave the orders; and which he did not as being the chief magistrate, and by virtue of his office, but acting as on a special occasion, at the command of God, and to show his zeal for him, and indignation at such a breach of his command. In what manner this was done, is not easy to say; he was not torn to pieces by the hand, without an instrument, as Baebius by the Romans (t); or sawn asunder, as some by Caligula (u); and as Isaiah the prophet is said to be by Manasseh, king of Judah, to which it is thought the apostle alludes, <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>. According to Ben Gersom, the word signifies he cleaved him, as wood is cleaved; or divided him into four parts, as Jarchi; perhaps he slew him with the sword, and then quartered him; that is, ordered it to be done. <p>(s) "orbavit", Pagninus, Montanus, Vatablus, &amp;c.

It may perhaps mean no more than “executed” (Sept. <span class="greekheb">ἔσφαξε</span>). The E. V. follows the Vulg.: “in frusta concidit.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As thy sword hath made women childless.</span> Agag's life had been spent in freebooting expeditions, in which he had shed blood ruthlessly, and so justice required his execution in requital of his deeds to others. <span class="cmt_word">Samuel hewed Agag in pieces.</span> The verb occurs only here, and probably refers to some particular method of execution, like the quartering of the middle ages. Being in the Piel conjugation, it would mean not so much that Samuel put Agag to death himself as that he commanded it to be done. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This request Samuel refused, repeating at the same time the sentence of rejection, and turned to depart. "Then Saul laid hold of the lappet of his mantle (i.e., his upper garment), and it tore" (lit. was torn off). That the Niphal &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; is correct, and is not to be altered into &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1506;, "Saul tore off the lappet," according to the rendering of the lxx, as Thenius supposes, is evident from the explanation which Samuel gave of the occurrence (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>): "Jehovah hath torn the sovereignty of Israel from thee to-day, and given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou." As Saul was about to hold back the prophet by force, that he might obtain from him a revocation of the divine sentence, the tearing of the mantle, which took place accidentally, and evidently without any such intention on the part of Saul, was to serve as a sign of the rending away of the sovereignty from him. Samuel did not yet know to whom Jehovah would give it; he therefore used the expression &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1498;, as &#1512;&#1506; is applied to any one with whom a person associates. To confirm his own words, he adds in <a href="/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a> : "And also the Trust of Israel doth not lie and doth not repent, for He is not a man to repent." &#1504;&#1510;&#1495; signifies constancy, endurance, then confidence, trust, because a man can trust in what is constant. This meaning is to be retained here, where the word is used as a name for God, and not the meaning gloria, which is taken in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a> from the Aramaean usage of speech, and would be altogether unsuitable here, where the context suggests the idea of unchangeableness. For a man's repentance or regret arises from his changeableness, from the fluctuations in his desires and actions. This is never the case with God; consequently He is &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1504;&#1510;&#1495;, the unchangeable One, in whom Israel can trust, since He does not lie or deceive, or repent of His purposes. These words are spoken &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; (theomorphically), whereas in <a href="/1_samuel/15-11.htm">1 Samuel 15:11</a> and other passages, which speak of God as repenting, the words are to be understood &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; (anthropomorphically; cf. <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). </body></html>
