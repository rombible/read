Yet they would not renounce Dagon; and instead of seeking God's mercy, they desired to get clear of his ark. Carnal hearts, when they smart under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put him far from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seek him for their friend. But their devices to escape the Divine judgments only increase them.

There is something of this history preserved in a story wrongly told by Herodotus (b), who relates that the Scythians returning from Egypt passed through Ashkelon, a city of Syria (one of the five principalities of the Philistines), and that some of them robbed the temple of Venus there; for which the goddess sent on them and their posterity the disease of emerods, and that the Scythians themselves acknowledged that they were troubled with it on that account. <p>(b) Clio, sive, l. 1. c. 105. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">the cry of the city went up to heaven</span>] Cp. <a href="/exodus/2-13.htm" title="And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smite you your fellow?">Exodus 2:13</a>.

Though in ver. 10 Ekronites is in the plural, yet in all that follows the singular is used. "They have brought about the ark to me, to slay me and my people... That it slay me not and my people." It is the prince of Ekron who, as the representative of the people, expostulates with his fellow rulers for the wrong they are doing him. But finally all join in his lamentation, and the whole city, smitten by God's band sends up its prayer to heaven for mercy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The visitation of God was not restricted to the demolition of the statue of Dagon, but affected the people of Ashdod as well.

That the latter is included here, is evident from the dedicatory offerings with which the Philistines sought to mitigate the wrath of the God of the Israelites (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4-5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-11.htm">1 Samuel 6:11</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>), although the verse before us simply mentions the diseases with which God visited them.<p>(Note: At the close of <a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a> the Septuagint contains some comprehensive additions; viz., at the close of <a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a> : &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#787;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;; and at the end of <a href="/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a> : &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. This last clause we also find in the Vulgate, expressed as follows: Et eballiverunt villae et agri in medio regionis illius, et nati sunt mures, et facta est confusio mortis magnae in civitate. Ewald's decision with regard to these clauses (Gesch. ii. p. 541) is, that they are not wanted at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>, but that they are all the more necessary at <a href="/1_samuel/6-1.htm">1 Samuel 6:1</a>; whereas at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>, they would rather injure the sense. Thenius admits that the clause appended to <a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3</a> is nothing more than a second translation of our sixth verse, which has been interpolated by a copyist of the Greek in the wrong place; whereas that of <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a> contains the original though somewhat corrupt text, according to which the Hebrew text should be emended. But an impartial examination would show very clearly, that all these additions are nothing more than paraphrases founded upon the context. The last part of the addition to <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a> is taken verbatim from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-11.htm">1 Samuel 5:11</a>, whilst the first part is a conjecture based upon <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-4.htm">1 Samuel 6:4-5</a>. Jerome, if indeed the addition in our text of the Vulgate really originated with him, and was not transferred into his version from the Itala, did not venture to suppress the clause interpolated in the Alexandrian version. This is very evident from the words confusio mortis magnae, which are a literal rendering of &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;; whereas in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-11.htm">1 Samuel 5:11</a>, Jerome has given to &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, which the lxx rendered &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, the much more accurate rendering pavor mortis. Moreover, neither the Syriac nor Targum Jonath. has this clause; so that long before the time of Jerome, the Hebrew text existed in the form in which the Masoretes have handed it down to us.)<p>"And He smote them with &#1506;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., boils:" according to the Rabbins, swellings on the anus, mariscae (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>). For &#1506;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; the Masoretes have invariably substituted &#1496;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, which is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-11.htm">1 Samuel 6:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a>, and was probably regarded as more decorous. Ashdod is a more precise definition of the word them, viz., Ashdod, i.e., the inhabitants of Ashdod and its territory. </body></html>
