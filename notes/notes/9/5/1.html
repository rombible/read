We can, however, from <a href="/context/psalms/78-60.htm" title="So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;">Psalm 78:60-64</a>, and two passages in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm" title="But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.">Jeremiah 7:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-9.htm" title="Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 26:9</a>), complete the story of the sanctuary city after the death of Eli. After the victory of Aphek, the Philistines, flushed with success, probably at once marched on Shiloh, where, from the words of the above quoted Psalm, they seem to have revenged themselves for past injuries by a terrible massacre, and then to have razed the sacred buildings of the city to the ground. The awful fate of the priestly city seems to have become a proverb in Israel. “This house shall be like Shiloh,” wrote Jeremiah, hundreds of years later, and “this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant.” Yet, in spite of this crushing blow, the national life of the Hebrew people was by no means exterminated; we shall soon hear of its revival under happier auspices. There were others in Israel like Samuel, who, as we have seen, with all their hearts trusted in that Lord who, “when Israel was a child, then He loved him;” others like that weak but still righteous judge Eli, who for one great weakness had paid so awful a penalty; many others, like the wife of Phinehas, the wicked priest, and Elkanah and Hannah, the pious father and mother of Samuel, who dwelt in “Ramah of the Watchers.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm" title="And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.">1 Samuel 5:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Philistines took the ark of God — </span>Abarbinel gives several reasons why God suffered the ark of his presence to fall into the hands of these uncircumcised heathen: 1st, The Israelites were such great sinners that they were unworthy of this symbol of the divine presence among them: 2d, The idolatry of Micah remained to this day in the land, therefore God fulfilled his threatening, <a href="/context/leviticus/26-19.htm" title="And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:...">Leviticus 26:19-31</a> : 3d, The sin of the priests highly provoked him to deliver up the ark, which was in their hands when they were killed: 4th, The Israelites greatly offended in carrying the ark into the battle without asking counsel of God: 5th, He resolved to demonstrate his power even among the enemies of Israel. <span class="ital">And brought it from Eben-ezer — </span>Where the Israelites were encamped before the battle, chap. <a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm" title="And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.

Thus the kingdom of Satan will certainly fall before the kingdom of Christ, error before truth, profaneness before godliness, and corruption before grace in the hearts of the faithful. When the interests of religion seem to be ready to sink, even then we may be confident that the day of their triumph will come. When Christ, the true Ark of the covenant, really enters the heart of fallen man, which is indeed Satan's temple, all idols will fall, every endeavour to set them up again will be vain, sin will be forsaken, and unrighteous gain restored; the Lord will claim and possess the throne. But pride, self-love, and worldly lusts, though dethroned and crucified, still remain within us, like the stump of Dagon. Let us watch and pray that they may not prevail. Let us seek to have them more entirely destroyed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The lesson of the ruin brought upon Churches by the covetousness and profligacy of their priests, which is here taught us so forcibly, and which has been again and again illustrated in Jews and Christians, is too solemn and important to be overlooked.

It was a place of great strength, and special importance, from its position on the high road between Syria and Egypt. It was assigned to Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm" title="Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, to the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof:">Joshua 15:47</a>), but never conquered till the reign of Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm" title="And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). The Assyrian king Sargon’s ‘Tartan’ (i.e. General) took it about b.c. 716, and about b.c. 630 it proved its strength by resisting Psammitichus king of Egypt for 29 years. It was destroyed by Jonathan Maccabaeus (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-84.htm" title="But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire.">1Ma 10:84</a>), but rebuilt after the Roman conquest of Judaea.

From <a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60-64</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-9.htm">Jeremiah 26:9</a>, we gather that from Aphek the Philistines marched upon Shiloh, and having captured it, put all whom they found there to the sword, and levelled the buildings to the ground. Especially their wrath fell upon the priests, in revenge for the bringing of the ark to the camp, by which the war was made a religious one, and the worst feelings of fanaticism aroused. Of all this the history says nothing, nor of the measures taken by Samuel under these trying circumstances. From his previous eminence, the government would naturally devolve upon him, especially as Eli's sons were both slain; and evidently he must have managed in some way to save the sacred vessels of the sanctuary, and the numerous records of the past history of the nation laid up at Shiloh. Whatever learning there was in Israel had its seat there; it was probably the only school wherein men were initiated in the knowledge brought out of Egypt; and it is one of the worst and most barbarous results of war that it destroys so much connected with human progress and civilisation, overthrowing with its violent hand as well the means of a nation's culture as the results thereof. Samuel evidently did all that was possible to counteract these evils; and as the Philistine army withdrew into its own country immediately after the destruction of Shiloh, probably to carry homo the rich spoils obtained there, he was apparently able to ward off the worst effects of the Philistine invasion, and by rapidly reorganising the government to save the people from utter demoralisation. But upon all this Scripture is silent, because it concerns the history of Israel on its temporal side, and not as it exemplifies God's spiritual dealings with nations and men. <span class="cmt_word">From Eben-ezer</span> (see on 1 Samuel 4:1) <span class="cmt_word">unto Ashdod.</span> This town, the Azotus of <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>, was with Ekron and other Philistine cities, assigned to the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>) but never actually conquered. It lay near the sea, about thirty-two miles north of Gaza, and is now an unimportant village, still bearing the name of Esdud. Of the five Philistine capitals Ashdod and Gaza were of the most importance, as being the keys of Egypt, and the former was also enriched by the sale of the produce of Arabia, of which it was the emporium. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the messenger informed him of the defeat of the Israelites, the death of his sons, and the capture of the ark, at the last news Eli fell back from his seat by the side of the gate, and broke his neck, and died. The loss of the ark was to him the most dreadful of all - more dreadful than the death of his two sons. Eli had judged Israel forty years. The reading twenty in the Septuagint does not deserve the slightest notice, if only because it is perfectly incredible that Eli should have been appointed judge of the nation in his seventy-eight year. </body></html>
