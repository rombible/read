The LXX. has an addition to the Hebrew text here which speaks of a terrible land plague which, apparently from subsequent notices, visited Philistia in addition to the bodily sufferings here spoken of.

The Greek translators, however, failing to understand the meaning of the offering of golden mice, added the words—apparently in accordance with a received tradition—by way of explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm" title="But the hand of the LORD was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.">1 Samuel 5:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">The hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod — </span>Since they were so blind as not to see his hand in throwing down their god, he smote them with such sore plagues in their own bodies as made them sensible of his power, by destroying great numbers of them. <span class="ital">With emerods</span> — The piles, a most painful and distressing disorder. <span class="ital">Ashdod, and the coasts thereof — </span>Not only the people of the city, but of the villages belonging to it, were smitten with this plague.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-12 The hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Philistines; he not only convinced them of their folly, but severely chastised their insolence.

Carnal hearts, when they smart under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were possible, put him far from them, than enter into covenant or communion with him, and seek him for their friend.

The present Heb. text leaves this to be inferred from ch. <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm" title="Why you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.">1 Samuel 6:5</a>, but the Sept. inserts here “And mice sprang up in the midst of their land, and there was a very deadly destruction in the city.” This may be merely an inference from <span class="ital"><a href="/1_samuel/5-11.htm" title="So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.">1 Samuel 5:11</a></span> and <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm" title="Why you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.">1 Samuel 6:5</a>, but the numerous divergences of the Sept. from the existing Heb. text in chaps, 5 and 6 (making full allowance for obvious glosses and errors of transcription) seem to shew that the Greek translators employed a text which had not been subjected to the final revision which fixed our present Heb. text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) Their bodies were attacked by a loathsome and painful disease, either (a) <span class="ital">emerods = haemorrhoids</span> or bleeding piles; or more probably (b) <span class="ital">boils</span>, which are a characteristic symptom of the oriental plague. The latter explanation agrees better with the infectiousness and fatality of the scourge.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the coasts thereof</span>] = the <span class="ital">borders</span> thereof. <span class="ital">Coast</span> is derived from <span class="ital">costa</span>, a rib, or side, and originally meant any border or frontier-line, not the sea-line only, cp. <a href="/joshua/1-4.htm" title="From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.">Joshua 1:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> his power and might were exercised in smiting them with severe plagues. A question here arises whether, as the Septuagint affirms, besides the scourge of emerods, their land was desolated by swarms of field mice. It is certain that they sent as votive offerings golden images of "the mice that mar the land" (<a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a>); but the translators of the Septuagint too often attempt to make all things easy by unauthorised additions, suggested by the context; and so probably here it was the wish to explain why mice were sent which made them add, "and mice were produced in the land." Really the mouse was a symbol of pestilence (Herod., 2:141), and appears as such in hieroglyphics; and by sending golden mice with golden emerods the lords of the Philistines expressed very clearly that the emerods had been epidemic. This word, more correctly spelt haemorrhoids, has this in its favour, that the noun used here, <span class="accented">ophalim</span>, is never read in the synagogue. Wherever the word occurs the reader was instructed to say <span class="accented">tehorim</span>, the vowels of which are actually attached to the consonants of <span class="accented">ophalim</span> in the text of our Hebrew Bibles. In <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>. <span class="accented">tehorim</span> is mentioned as one of the loathsome skin diseases of Egypt, and though rendered "emerods" in the A.V., is possibly, as translated by Aquila, "an eating ulcer." <span class="accented">Ophalim</span> need only mean <span class="accented">turnouts, swellings</span>, its original signification being "a hill" (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>); yet as the word was not thought fit for public reading in the synagogue, we may feel sure that it means some such tumours as the A.V. describes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The judgment which fell upon Eli through this stroke extended still further. His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child (near) to be delivered. &#1500;&#1500;&#1514;, contracted from &#1500;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514; (from &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;: see Ges. 69, 3, note 1; Ewald, 238, c.). When she heard the tidings of the capture (&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1511;&#1495;, "with regard to the being taken away") of the ark of God, and the death of her father-in-law and husband, she fell upon her knees and was delivered, for her pains had fallen upon her (lit. had turned against her), and died in consequence. Her death, however, was but a subordinate matter to the historian. He simply refers to it casually in the words, "and about the time of her death," for the purpose of giving her last words, in which she gave utterance to her grief at the loss of the ark, as a matter of greater importance in relation to his object. As she lay dying, the women who stood round sought to comfort her, by telling her that she had brought forth a son; but "she did not answer, and took no notice (&#1500;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;  equals  &#1500;&#1489; &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, animum advertere; cf. <a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>), but called to the boy (i.e., named him), Ichabod (&#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; &#1488;&#1497;, no glory), saying, The glory of Israel is departed," referring to the capture of the ark of God, and also to her father-in-law and husband. She then said again, "Gone (&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, wandered away, carried off) is the glory of Israel, for the ark of God is taken." The repetition of these words shows how deeply the wife of the godless Phinehas had taken to heart the carrying off of the ark, and how in her estimation the glory of Israel had departed with it. Israel could not be brought lower. With the surrender of the earthly throne of His glory, the Lord appeared to have abolished His covenant of grace with Israel; for the ark, with the tables of the law and the capporeth, was the visible pledge of the covenant of grace which Jehovah had made with Israel. </body></html>
