It is hardly the expression we should expect Achish to use of David’s followers. All Israelites were, of course, “subjects of Saul,” but the term would hardly be used except by one hostile to David, as Nabal was; he once (<a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1Samuel 25:10</a>) made use of an insulting term of a like nature to David. Achish, we know, seemed ever kindly disposed to the outlawed son of Jesse. A probable suggestion has, however, been lately made, that the reference here is to those tribes of Manasseh (comp. <a href="/context/1_chronicles/12-19.htm" title="And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines on advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.">1Chronicles 12:19-21</a>) who had only lately come over to David. Was it not also possible that these very Manassites, who had only very recently deserted the king’s cause for David’s, were known to some of the Philistines as Saul’s soldiers, and that their suspicions had been awakened in the first place by finding them marching under David’s standard in the division of Gath?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/29-10.htm" title="Why now rise up early in the morning with your master's servants that are come with you: and as soon as you be up early in the morning, and have light, depart....">1 Samuel 29:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">With thy master’s servants — </span>This intimates that the lords of the Philistines would not trust them, because they looked on them still as Saul’s subjects. <span class="ital">David and his men rose up early — </span>David did not then know how necessary this was for the relief of his own city.

It is therefore to these new comers that Achish applies the expression. It is impossible not to recognize here a merciful interposition of Providence, by which David was not only saved from fighting against his king and country, but sent home just in time to recover his wives and property from the Amalekites <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30.htm">1 Samuel 30</a>. That David maintained his position by subtlety and falsehood, which were the invariable characteristics of his age and nation, is not in the least to be wondered at. No sanction is given by this narrative to the use of falsehood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said&#8212;The Philistine government had constitutional checks&#8212;or at least the king was not an absolute sovereign; but his authority was limited&#8212;his proceedings liable to be controlled by "the powerful barons of that rude and early period&#8212;much as the kings of Europe in the Middle Ages were by the proud and lawless aristocracy which surrounded them" [Chalmers].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With thy master’s servants; </span> he intimates the ground of the Philistines’ jealousy concerning David and his men, that they were all servants of Saul, and therefore had an obligation, and were suspected to have an affection, to their old lord and master, against whom even David himself could not make them fight, especially with and for the Philistines. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As soon as ye have light, </span> depart; before the battle begin, lest, if you delay, the lords of the Philistines fall upon you, and destroy you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore now rise up early with thy master's servants that are come with thee,....

It has been well remarked that while this would be a strange description of David's own men, it would exactly describe that band of deserters belonging to the tribe of Manasseh who, instead of obeying Saul's summons to the war with the Philistines, joined David about this time (see <a href="/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As soon as ye be up early in the morning,</span> etc. If it was on the second day s march that the Philistine lords objected to David's continuance with them, he would be back at Gath in two days, and on the third day reach Ziklag, as is said in <a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>. However difficult David's position may have been, still every one must condemn his conduct towards Achish as dishonourable; but God, who often deals with men more mercifully than they deserve, nevertheless rescued him from his state of perplexity, and saved him from the necessity of either fighting against his own countrymen or of still more dishonourably breaking his word to Achish by deserting in the battle. He also sent him home just in time to rescue from a miserable fate those whom he loved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But the princes, i.e., the four other princes of the Philistines, not the courtiers of Achish himself, were angry with Achish, and demanded, "Send the man back, that he may return to his place, which thou hast assigned him; that he may not go down with us into the war, and may not become an adversary (satan) to us in the war; for wherewith could he show himself acceptable to his lord (viz., Saul), if not with the heads of these men?" &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, nonne, strictly speaking, introduces a new question to confirm the previous question.
