David’s having apparently learned and practised Philistine music when in Gath, which he subsequently introduced into Jerusalem, has been already noticed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-5 David waited with a secret hope that the Lord would help him out of his difficulty. But he seems to have been influenced too much by the fear of man, in consenting to attend Achish. It is hard to come near to the brink of sin, and not to fall in. God inclined the princes of the Philistines to oppose David's being employed in the battle. Thus their dislike befriended him, when no friend could do him such a kindness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He fell unto me - The regular word for deserting and going over to the other side.

But David is not free from censure in his professions to Achish (1Sa 29:8), to do what he probably had not the smallest purpose of doing&#8212;of fighting with Achish against his enemies. It is just an instance of the unhappy consequences into which a false step&#8212;a departure from the straight course of duty&#8212;will betray everyone who commits it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,....

The woman did all this from natural sympathy for the unhappy king, and not, as Thenius supposes, to remove all suspicion of deception from Saul's mind; for she had not deceived the king at all.</body></html>
