Kimchi observes, that all confess a first cause; and therefore when he swore to David, he swore by him in whom David believed, perhaps out of complaisance to him, or that David might pay the greater regard to his oath: <p>thou hast been upright; sincere, honest, faithful, and just in all his deportment; yet not so sincere as he thought him to be, witness the road he pretended he had taken against the south of Judah, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>, <p>and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in sight; his behaviour in the army, attending him as the keeper of his head, or captain of his bodyguard, was exceeding agreeable to him, and he could wish to have him continued: <p>for I have not found evil in thee, since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day; whatever he had done before to the Philistines, having greatly afflicted and distressed them in his wars with them, of which this seems to be an exception: <p>nevertheless, the lords favour thee not; or thou art not acceptable to them, yea, very offensive and disagreeable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> going out and thy coming in with me in the host <i>is</i> good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.</span><p>(d) That is, was conversant with me.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>6–11.

"Saul was too hardened in his sin to express any grief or pain, either on his own account or because of the fate of his sons and his people. In stolid desperation he went to meet his fate. This was the terrible end of a man whom the Spirit of God had once taken possession of and turned into another man, and whom he had endowed with gifts to be the leader of the people of God" (O. v. Gerlach). </body></html>
