On this memorable occasion the king plainly told Samuel that though he would gratefully receive any help which the prophet of the Most High could and would bring him, still, in an emergency like the present, sooner than run any risk, he preferred to act alone, and, if necessary, to go into battle without Divine consecration and blessing. The danger at this juncture was imminent; to ward it off, he considered that the direct Divine intimation which he allowed he had received through Samuel must be disregarded. Acting upon this persuasion, he set it aside, acting according to the ordinary dictates of worldly prudence. He must in his action at Gilgal either have forgotten or disbelieved the story of the Joshua conquest, and of the signal deliverances under the hero Judges, when the Glorious Arm fought by the people, and splendid successes were won in the face of enormous odds through the intervention of no mortal aid.<p>Saul might have been, and was, a valiant and skilful general, but was no fitting Viceroy of the invisible King in heaven, who required from him before all things the most ardent unquestioning faith.<p>Saul and his house, it is too clear, would only rule the Israel of God according to the dictates of their own haughty will.<p>The twice-repeated assertion of Samuel, “Thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord” (<a href="/context/1_samuel/13-13.htm" title="And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom on Israel for ever.">1Samuel 13:13-14</a>)—an assertion uncontradicted by Saul—shows us that this whole transaction was an act of overt rebellion against the will of the Eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/13-11.htm" title="And Samuel said, What have you done?

Saul, Weary of Waiting for Samuel, Sacrifices.<p>9-14. Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings&#8212;Saul, though patriotic enough in his own way, was more ambitious of gaining the glory of a triumph to himself than ascribing it to God. He did not understand his proper position as king of Israel; and although aware of the restrictions under which he held the sovereignty, he wished to rule as an autocrat, who possessed absolute power both in civil and sacred things. This occasion was his first trial. Samuel waited till the last day of the seven, in order to put the constitutional character of the king to the test; and, as Saul, in his impatient and passionate haste knowingly transgressed (1Sa 13:12) by invading the priest's office and thus showing his unfitness for his high office (as he showed nothing of the faith of Gideon and other Hebrew generals), he incurred a threat of the rejection which his subsequent waywardness confirmed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What hast thou done?</span> he suspected that Saul had transgressed, either by his dejected countenance, or some words uttered by him, though not here expressed; but he asks him, that he might be more fitly and certainly informed, and that Saul might be brought to an ingenuous confession of his sin, and true repentance for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">within the days appointed, </span> i.e. when the seventh day was come, and a good part of it past; whence I concluded thou wouldst not come that day, and that thou hadst forgotten thy appointment, or been hindered by some extraordinary occasion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Samuel said, what hast thou done?

Each day's delay made his small force dwindle rapidly away, and the Philistines might at any hour move down from Michmash upon him at Gilgal and destroy him. But it was the reality of the danger which put his faith and obedience to the trial. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Philistines also did not delay to avenge the defeat at Geba. They collected an innumerable army: 30,000 chariots, 6000 horsemen, and people, i.e., foot-soldiers, without number (as the sand by the sea-shore; cf. <a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>, etc.). &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; by the side of &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; can only mean war chariots. 30,000 war chariots, however, bear no proportion whatever to 6000 horsemen, not only because the number of war chariots is invariably smaller than that of the horsemen (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>), but also, as Bochart observes in his Hieroz. p. i. lib. ii. c. 9, because such a number of war chariots is never met with either in sacred or profane history, not even in the case of nations that were much more powerful than the Philistines. The number is therefore certainly corrupt, and we must either read 3000 (&#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; instead of &#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;), according to the Syriac and Arabic, or else simply 1000; and in the latter case the origin of the number thirty must be attributed to the fact, that through the oversight of a copyist the &#1500; of the word &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; was written twice, and consequently the second &#1500; was taken for the numeral thirty. This army was encamped "at Michmash, before (i.e., in the front, or on the western side of) Bethaven:" for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>, Bethaven was to the east of Michmash; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514; when it occurs in geographical accounts, does not "always mean to the east," as Thenius erroneously maintains, but invariably means simply "in front" (see at <a href="/genesis/2-14.htm">Genesis 2:14</a>).<p>(Note: Consequently there is no ground whatever for altering the text according to the confused rendering of the lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, for the purpose of substituting for the correct statement in the text a description which would be geographically wrong, viz., to the south-east of Beth-horon, since Michmash was neither to the south nor to the south-east, but to the east of Beth-horon.) </body></html>
