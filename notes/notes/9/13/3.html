This personal beauty and swiftness of foot in attack or retreat gained for him among the troops the name of “gazelle.” (The first lines of the song, <a href="/2_samuel/1-19.htm" title="The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!">2Samuel 1:19</a>, can only be explained on the supposition that Jonathan was well known by this name in the army.) “In all this, as in his uprightness and fidelity, he showed himself the right worthy son of a king.”—Ewald. Some translate the word rightly rendered “garrison” as “pillar,” a sign of the authority of the Philistines; others—<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Ewald—as a proper name, supposing that the officer appointed to collect tribute from Israel in that part of the country is meant.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul blew the trumpet.</span>—This was evidently more than a communication of good news to the people.

For above a year he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken and to disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency, they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies of the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends. When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with his management, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come to him, or speedily deserted him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This was the first act in the war of independence, and probably the first feat in arms of the young hero Jonathan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 13:3, 4.

The word rendered "garrison" is different from that of 1Sa 13:23; 14:1, and signifies, literally, something erected; probably a pillar or flagstaff, indicative of Philistine ascendency. That the secret demolition of this standard, so obnoxious to a young and noble-hearted patriot, was the feat of Jonathan referred to, is evident from the words, "the Philistines heard of it," which is not the way we should expect an attack on a fortress to be noticed.<p>Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land&#8212;This, a well-known sound, was the usual Hebrew war-summons; the first blast was answered by the beacon fire in the neighboring places. A second blast was blown&#8212;then answered by a fire in a more distant locality, whence the proclamation was speedily diffused over the whole country. As the Philistines resented what Jonathan had done as an overt attempt to throw off their yoke, a levy, en masse, of the people was immediately ordered, the rendezvous to be the old camping-ground at Gilgal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The first design of Saul and Jonathan was to free then land from the garrisons which the Philistines had in it; and they first begin to clear their own country of Benjamin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Geba; </span> not the same place called Gibeah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm" title="Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.">1 Samuel 13:2</a></span>, (for if the place were the same, why should he vary the name of it in the same story, and in the next verse? nor is it likely that Jonathan would choose that place for his camp where the Philistines had a garrison,) but another place in the same tribe, in which there were two distinct places, Geba and Gibeah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/18-24.htm" title="And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:">Joshua 18:24</a>,28</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let the Hebrews hear, </span> i.e. he sent messengers to tell them all what Jonathan had done, and how the Philistines were enraged at it, and made great preparations for war; and therefore what necessity there was of gathering themselves together, and coming to him, for his and their own defence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba,.... Not the same with Gibeah of Benjamin, as Jarchi; for it can hardly be thought that Jonathan should place himself with his thousand men where the Philistines had a garrison; or that if this was the same with that in the preceding verse, that it should be called by another name in this; but Gibeah and Geba were two places, as Kimchi observes, both indeed in the tribe of Benjamin, and it is very probable not far from one another; see <a href="/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>. This seems to be the same with the hill of God, where was a garrison of the Philistines, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>, who after their defeat by Samuel contented themselves with some strong holds and garrisons in some parts of the land to keep Israel in awe; the Targum understands this of a single person, a governor of the Philistines in this place, whom Jonathan slew, and so Jarchi; and according to R. Isaiah he was one that was appointed to gather the tax for them: <p>and the Philistines heard of it, which alarmed them, and made them prepare for war: <p>and Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land; not he in person, for he was at Gilgal, as the next verse shows; but he ordered it to be blown, being aware of the preparations the Philistines were making to attack him: <p>saying, let the Hebrews hear; both what his son had done, and what the Philistines were doing. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <i>was</i> in <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Geba, and the Philistines heard <i>of it</i>.

Cp. <a href="/judges/3-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.">Jdg 3:27</a>; <a href="/judges/6-34.htm" title="But the Spirit of the LORD came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.">Jdg 6:34</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2 Samuel 20:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Let the Hebrews hear</span>] The name “Hebrews” is generally employed only by foreigners, or in speaking to foreigners. See note on <a href="/1_samuel/4-6.htm" title="And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.">1 Samuel 4:6</a>.

But the Sept. reads “The slaves have revolted,” and it may be conjectured that we should transpose the words, and read “The Philistines heard saying, The slaves (or, the Hebrews) have revolted.” The consonants of the Hebrew words for “slaves” and “Hebrews” are almost identical, and are constantly liable to be confused.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In Geba.</span> By this garrison the Philistines commanded the further end of the defile, and they had also another outpost beyond it near Gibeah itself (<a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). Probably neither of these garrisons was very strong, and Saul may have intended that Jonathan should attack them while he held the northern end of the pass, which would be the first place assailed by the Philistines in force. As regards the word translated <span class="accented">garrison</span>, attempts have been made to render it <span class="accented">pillar</span>, and to represent it as a token of Philistine supremacy which Jonathan threw down, while others, with the Septuagint, take it as a proper name; but the word <span class="accented">smote</span> is strongly in favour of the rendering of the A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Let the Hebrews hear.</span> Saul must have intended war when he thus posted himself and Jonathan in such commanding spots, and probably all this had been sketched out by Samuel (see on 1 Samuel 10:8). He now summons all Israel to the war. It is strange that he should call the people "Hebrews," the Philistine title of contempt; but it is used again in ver. 7, and of course in ver. 19. The Septuagint reads, "Let the slaves revolt," but though followed by Josephus, the change of text is not probable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; gives the reason for the main thought of the previous verse, 'Fear not, but serve the Lord,' etc.) the Lord will not forsake His people for His great name's sake; for it hath pleased the Lord (for &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;, see at <a href="/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>) to make you His people." The emphasis lies upon His. This the Israelites could only be, when they proved themselves to be the people of God, by serving Jehovah with all their heart. "For His great name's sake," i.e., for the great name which He had acquired in the sight of all the nations, by the marvellous guidance of Israel thus far, to preserve it against misapprehension and blasphemy (see at <a href="/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>). </body></html>
