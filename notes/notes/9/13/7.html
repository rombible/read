The chief advantages of the enemies of the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends.

Instead of venturing an encounter, they fled in all directions. Some, in their panic, left the country (1Sa 13:7), but most took refuge in the hiding-places which the broken ridges of the neighborhood abundantly afford. The rocks are perforated in every direction with "caves," and "holes," and "pits"&#8212;crevices and fissures sunk deep in the rocky soil, subterranean granaries or dry wells in the adjoining fields.

SAUL'S RASH SACRIFICE (Vers. 8-14). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The history of the reign of Saul commences with this chapter;<p>(Note: The connection of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-11</a> of this chapter with <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a> is adduced in support of the hypothesis that <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13</a> forms a direct continuation of the account that was broken off in <a href="/1_samuel/10-16.htm">1 Samuel 10:16</a>. This connection must be admitted; but it by no means follows that in the source from which the books before us were derived, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13</a> was directly attached to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-16.htm">1 Samuel 8:16</a>, and that Samuel intended to introduce Saul publicly as king here in Gilgal immediately before the attack upon the Philistines, to consecrate him by the solemn presentation of sacrifices, and to connect with this the religious consecration of the approaching campaign. For there is not a word about any such intention in the chapter before us or in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>, nor even the slightest hint at it. Thenius has founded this view of his upon his erroneous interpretation of &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468; in <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a> as an imperative, as if Samuel intended to command Saul to go to Gilgal immediately after the occurrence of the signs mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a>.: a view which is at variance with the instructions given to him, to do what his hand should find after the occurrence of those signs. To this we may also add the following objections: How is it conceivable that Saul, who concealed his anointing even from his own family after his return from Samuel to Gibeah (<a href="/1_samuel/10-16.htm">1 Samuel 10:16</a>), should have immediately after chosen 3000 men of Israel to begin the war against the Philistines? How did Saul attain to any such distinction, that at his summons all Israel gathered round him as their king, even before he had been publicly proclaimed king in the presence of the people, and before he had secured the confidence of the people by any kingly heroic deed? The fact of his having met with a band of prophets, and even prophesied in his native town of Gibeah after his departure from Samuel, and that this had become a proverb, is by no means enough to explain the enterprises described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-1.htm">1 Samuel 8:1-7</a>, which so absolutely demand the incidents that occurred in the meantime as recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17-12:25</a> even to make them intelligible, that any writing in which <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>. following directly upon <a href="/1_samuel/10-16.htm">1 Samuel 10:16</a> would necessarily be regarded as utterly faulty. This fact, which I have already adduced in my examination of the hypothesis defended by Thenius in my Introduction to the Old Testament (p. 168), retains its force undiminished, even though, after a renewed investigation of the question, I have given up the supposed connection between <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a> and the proclamation mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>., which I defended there.)<p>and according to the standing custom in the history of the kings, it opens with a statement of the age of the king when he began to reign, and the number of years that his reign lasted. If, for example, we compare the form and contents of this verse with <a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>, and other passages, where the age is given at which Ishbosheth, David, and many of the kings of Judah began to reign, and also the number of years that their reign lasted, there can be no doubt that our verse was also intended to give the same account concerning Saul, and therefore that every attempt to connect this verse with the one which follows is opposed to the uniform historical usage. Moreover, even if, as a matter of necessity, the second clause of _1 Samuel 13:1 could be combined with <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a> in the following manner: He was two years king over Israel, then Saul chose 3000 men, etc.; the first half of the verse would give no reasonable sense, according to the Masoretic text that has come down to us. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; cannot possibly be rendered "jam per annum regnaverat Saul," "Saul had been king for a year," or "Saul reigned one year," but can only mean "Saul was a year old when he became king." This is the way in which the words have been correctly rendered by the Sept. and Jerome; and so also in the Chaldee paraphrase ("Saul was an innocent child when he began to reign") this is the way in which the text has been understood.<p>It is true that this statement as to his age is obviously false; but all that follows from that is, that there is an error in the text, namely, that between &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; the age has fallen out, - a thing which could easily take place, as there are many traces to show that originally the numbers were not written in words, but only in letters that were used as numerals. This gap in the text is older than the Septuagint version, as our present text is given there. There is, it is true, an anonymus in the hexapla, in which we find the reading &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;; but this is certainly not according to ancient MSS, but simply according to a private conjecture, and that an incorrect one. For since Saul already had a son, Jonathan, who commanded a division of the army in the very first years of his reign, and therefore must have been at least twenty years of age, if not older, Saul himself cannot have been less than forty years old when he began to reign. Moreover, in the second half of the verse also, the number given is evidently a wrong one, and the text therefore equally corrupt; for the rendering "when he had reigned two years over Israel" is opposed both by the parallel passages already quoted, and also by the introduction of the name Saul as the subject in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>, which shows very clearly that <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a> commences a fresh sentence, and is not merely the apodosis to <a href="/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a>. But Saul's reign must have lasted longer than two years, even if, in opposition to all analogies to be found elsewhere, we should understand the two years as merely denoting the length of his reign up to the time of his rejection (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>), and not till the time of his death. Even then he reigned longer than that; for he could not possibly have carried on all the wars mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>, with Moab, Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah and the Philistines, in the space of two years. Consequently a numeral, say &#1499;, twenty, must also have dropped out before &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; (two years); since there are cogent reasons for assuming that his reign lasted as long as twenty or twenty-two years, reckoning to the time of his death. We have given the reasons themselves in connection with the chronology of the period of the judges (pp. 206f.).<p>(Note: The traditional account that Saul reigned forty years (<a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-24.htm">Acts 13:24</a>, and Josephus, Ant. vi. 14, 9) is supposed to have arisen, according to the conjecture of Thenius (on <a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>), from the fact that his son Ishbosheth was forty years old when he began to reign, and the notion that as he is not mentioned among the sons of Saul in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49</a>, he must have been born after the commencement of Saul's own reign. This conjecture is certainly a probable one; but it is much more natural to assume that as David and Solomon reigned forty years, it arose from the desire to make Saul's reign equal to theirs.) </body></html>
