This was the first step towards the development of Israel into a great military power. It was Saul’s military genius and foresight which enabled David and Solomon to make those great conquests which raised Israel for a time to the position of one of the greatest Eastern Powers. The really great life of Saul was frittered away in repelling what may be termed Israel’s domestic enemies. such as the Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites; but he left behind him a powerful and disciplined army, and a nation carefully trained to war. It has been asked, how was it, considering the position of Israel and the Philistines at that juncture—the latter people possessing evidently not a few strong places in the territories of the tribes, from whence they were in the habit of sallying forth, and harassing and pillaging the people—that Saul, instead of at once declaring war, dismissed the people gathered at Gilgal, only retaining so few? The probability is that Saul, with true military instinct, saw that Israel was at this period by no means trained or armed to undertake a regular war with such an enemy. He therefore adopted the wise course here related.<p><span class= "bld">Whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash.</span>—Michmash was a position strongly situated at the head of a pass some nine miles north-east of Jerusalem. The “one thousand” he placed under the command of his son Jonathan, and stationed them in the neighbourhood of his old home, where he would have the benefit of the aid of his family and kinsfolk. This is the first mention of the gallant and chivalrous prince, the story of whose unbroken and romantic friendship with David is one of the most touching episodes of these books. “If the substance of this narrative was written in David’s reign, we may perhaps see the effect of David’s generous and loving nature in the care taken to give Jonathan his due place of honour in the history.”—<span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 Saul reigned one year, and nothing particular happened; but in his second year the events recorded in this chapter took place. For above a year he gave the Philistine time to prepare for war, and to weaken and to disarm the Israelites. When men are lifted up in self-sufficiency, they are often led into folly. The chief advantages of the enemies of the church are derived from the misconduct of its professed friends. When Saul at length sounded an alarm, the people, dissatisfied with his management, or terrified by the power of the enemy, did not come to him, or speedily deserted him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The state of things which preceded the events described in this chapter seems to have been a comparative peace between Israel and the Philistines, since Saul had only 3,000 men under arms. At the same time Philistine garrisons continued to occupy the country of the Israelites in certain strong places, whereof one was at Geba (Jeba), in the immediate neighborhood of Gibeah <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>, and exactly opposite Michmash (Mukhmas), which was on the northern edge of the great Wady Suweinit. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel&#8212;This band of picked men was a bodyguard, who were kept constantly on duty, while the rest of the people were dismissed till their services might be needed. It seems to have been his tactics to attack the Philistine garrisons in the country by different detachments, rather than by risking a general engagement; and his first operations were directed to rid his native territory of Benjamin of these enemies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Saul chose, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">and</span> (i.e. then, as that adverb is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/3-5.htm" title="For God does know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.">Genesis 3:5</a> 18:10</span>, &c.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saul chose.

Out of the 300,000 that went with him to fight the Ammonites, and returned with him to Gilgal, where he now was, and had stayed as may be supposed about a year, since now he had reigned two years. These 3000 men some of them doubtless were appointed as a guard about his person, and the rest were a standing army to preserve the peace of the nation, to protect them from their enemies, to watch the motions of the Philistines, and to be ready on any sudden invasion: <p>whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash, and in Mount Bethel; "Michmash", according to Bunting, (s) was four miles from Gilgal. Jerom (t) says, in his time it was shown a large village on the borders of Aella, or Jerusalem, retaining its ancient name, nine miles distant from it, near the village Rama. Adrichomius (u) says it is now called Byra, and Mr. Maundrell (w) observes that it is supposed by some to be the same with Beer, whither Jotham fled after he had delivered his parable, <a href="/judges/9-21.htm">Judges 9:21</a>. Michmash is in the Misnah (x) celebrated for the best wheat being brought from it; and near to it, as appears from hence, was Bethel, and the mount of that name; and so Jerom (y) speaks of Bethel as over against Michmash; and this mount very probably is the same said to be on the east of Bethel, where Abraham built an altar, <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a> for Michmash lay to the east of Bethel: <p>and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; the native place of Saul, and this Jonathan was the son of Saul, <a href="/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>. According to Bunting (z), Gibeah, where Jonathan was stationed, was eight miles from Michmash: <p>and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent; to their own houses; or, as the Targum, to their cities; these were they that came at his summons, and were numbered at Bezek, and went with him to the relief of Jabeshgilead, and had been with him ever since, and now dismissed. <p>(s) Travels of the Patriarchs, &amp;c. p. 126.

They stand on the N. and S. respectively of the <span class="ital">Wady es Suweinit</span>, a deep ravine with precipitous sides running from the highlands of Benjamin to Jericho. “About two miles S. E. of Ai it becomes a narrow gorge with vertical precipices some 800 feet high.” Jonathan was in Gibeah, a few miles to the S. W. of Geba. See note on <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1 Samuel 10:5</a>.

He probably selected these 3000 men at the end of the war with the Ammonites, to strengthen the small bodyguard which he had gathered round him at Gibeah (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>). As being always in arms, they would become highly disciplined, and form the nucleus and centre of all future military operations (see on 1 Samuel 14:52). He stationed these on either side of the defile in the mountain range of Bethel, so exactly described in <a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>, where Sennacherib, as we read, leaves his carriage, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his baggage, at Michmash, and after defiling through the pass, arrives at Geba. Gibeah, where Jonathan was posted with 1000 of these picked warriors, was Saul's home, and his son would have the benefit there of the aid of Kish and Abner, while Michmash was the more exposed place, situate about seven miles northeast of Jerusalem. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:110) describes this defile as "a narrow gorge with vertical precipices some 800 feet high - a great crack or fissure in the country, which is peculiar in this respect, that you only become aware of its existence when close to the brink; for on the north the narrow spur of hills hides it, and on the south a flat plateau extends to the top of the crags. On the south side of this great chasm stands Geba of Benjamin, on a rocky knoll, with caverns beneath the houses, and arable land to the east; and on the opposite side, considerably lower than Geba, is the little village of Michmash, on a sort of saddle, backed by an open and fertile corn valley. This valley was famous for producing excellent barley. <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his tent.</span> This with us would be a warlike phrase; but as the mass of the Israelites then dwelt in tents,  it means simply their dispersion homewards; and so the Syriac translates, "He dismissed them each to his house" (see <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel thereupon announced to them first of all, that the Lord would not forsake His people for His great name's sake, if they would only serve Him with uprightness. In order, however, to give no encouragement to any false trust in the covenant faithfulness of the Lord, after the comforting words, "Fear not," he told them again very decidedly that they had done wrong, but that now they were not to turn away from the Lord, but to serve Him with all their heart, and not go after vain idols. To strengthen this admonition, he repeats the &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1488; in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm">1 Samuel 12:21</a>, with the explanation, that in turning from the Lord they would fall away to idols, which could not bring them either help or deliverance. To the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; after &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; the same verb must be supplied from the context: "Do not turn aside (from the Lord), for (ye turn aside) after that which is vain." &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, the vain, worthless thing, signifies the false gods. This will explain the construction with a plural: "which do not profit and do not save, because they are emptiness" (tohu), i.e., worthless beings (elilim, <a href="/leviticus/19-4.htm">Leviticus 19:4</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>). </body></html>
