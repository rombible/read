Perhaps the noble old man still hoped that the brilliant and gallant king would recognise his fatal error.<p>From Gilgal, we read, Samuel passed to Gibeah of Benjamin, the home of Saul: there, no doubt, he took counsel with and encouraged Jonathan, who was stationed there, and whose splendid gallantry was soon after to be called into action again.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul numbered the people.</span>—The disobedience of Saul had availed nothing. Instead of being able to lead a host against the Philistine army, the camp of Israel became deserted. Even his small division of regulars seems to have melted away; only six hundred answered to the despairing king’s roll-call. It would seem as though the Divine punishment had begun already.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/13-15.htm" title="And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.

Even if this be not so, yet friendly relations must have continued between Saul and Samuel, as the latter would otherwise certainly not have chosen Saul's home for his halting place; nor would he go thither without seeing Jonathan, and giving him aid and counsel. Saul numbered. See on 1 Samuel 11:8.
