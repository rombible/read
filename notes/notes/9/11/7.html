In that self-same hour, striking dead the oxen standing before his plough, he hews them in pieces, and handing a bloody strip to certain of the men standing around him, weeping for grief and shame and the wrong done to Israel, bade them swiftly bear these terrible war-signals throughout the length and breadth of the land, and by these means to rouse the nation to prompt action.<p>On this strange war-signal of king Saul, Ewald, in his <span class= "ital">History of Israel, </span>Book II., section iii. 1 (note), remarks, “how in like manner it was formerly the custom in Norway to send on the war-arrow; and in Scotland a fire-brand, with both ends dipped in blood, was dispatched as a war-token.”<p>Not improbably Saul cut the oxen into eleven pieces, and sent one to each of the other tribes.<p><span class= "bld">And the fear of the Lord fell on the people.</span>—It was some such mighty awakening under the influence of the Spirit of the Eternal, as is here related of King Saul, which suggested to the poet Asaph the bold but splendid image of the seventy-eighth Psalm, when, after describing in moving language the degradation and bitter woe of fallen Israel, the singer, struck with a new inspiration, bursts forth with “Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. And he smote his enemies,” &c. (<a href="/psalms/78-65.htm" title="Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.">Psalm 78:65</a>). “The people rose as one man” (see margin) against the enemies of their national freedom. It was the same Spirit of the Lord which inspired Saul to put himself at the head of the children of Israel which now laid hold of all the people, lifting them up, and giving them new strength and resistless courage, and the mighty feeling that God was with them.<p>It was owing to some influence of a similar nature that with scanty numbers, ill-armed and ill-trained, the Swiss won for their land centuries of freedom on memorable fields like Laupen and Morat, though the proudest chivalry of Europe was arrayed against them. it was the same Spirit which impelled the peace-loving traders of the marshes of Holland to rise as one man, and to drive out for ever from their loved strip of fen land the hitherto invincible armies of Spain. No oppressor, though backed by the wealth and power of an empire, has ever been able to resist the smallest people in whose heart has burned the flame of the Divine fire of the “fear of the Lord.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm" title="And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.

See the faith and confidence of Saul, and, grounded thereon, his courage and resolution. See also his activity in this business.

This particular form of war-summons was suited to the character and habits of an agricultural and pastoral people. Solemn in itself, the denunciation that accompanied it carried a terrible threat to those that neglected to obey it. Saul conjoins the name of Samuel with his own, to lend the greater influence to the measure, and to strike greater terror unto all contemners of the order.

Probably Saul cut the oxen into twelve pieces, and sent one to each tribe, with the threat that in case of disobedience their oxen would be similarly treated. The threat was moderate in that it did not touch their persons, but severe as regards their property, the labouring ox being man's faithful friend and servant. It is important also to notice that Saul speaks not only in his own name, but also in that of Samuel. It was as the man chosen of Jehovah to be king by the voice of his prophet that he acted, and so as one possessed of legitimate authority; and it seems also that Samuel went with him in person to the war (ver. 12). And the result answered to the energy with which Saul acted, for <span class="cmt_word">the fear of Jehovah</span> - or, rather, "a terror from Jehovah" - <span class="cmt_word">fell on the people, and they came out with one consent,</span> or, as it is rendered far more correctly and forcibly in the margin, "as one man." United by the kingly power, it was a nation that rose to defend one of its injured members. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nahash, the king of the Ammonites (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>), attacked the tribes on the east of the Jordan, no doubt with the intention of enforcing the claim to part of Gilead asserted by his ancestor in the time of Jephthah (<a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>), and besieged Jabesh in Gilead,<p>(Note: The time of this campaign is not mentioned in the Hebrew text. But it is very evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>, where the Israelites are said to have desired a king, when they saw that Nahash had come against them, that Nahash had invaded Gilead before the election of Saul as king. The Septuagint, however, renders the words &#1499;&#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;   (<a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>) by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, and therefore the translators must have read &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, which Ewald and Thenius would adopt as an emendation of the Hebrew text. But all the other ancient versions give the Masoretic text, viz., not only the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, but even Jerome, who renders it ille vero dissimulabat se audire. It is true that in our present Vulgate text these words are followed by et factum est quasi post mensem; but this addition has no doubt crept in from the Itala. With the general character of the Septuagint, the rendering of &#1499;&#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; by &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; is no conclusive proof that the word in their Hebrew Codex was &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;; it simply shows that this was the interpretation which they gave to &#1499;&#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;. And Josephus (vi. 5, 1), who is also appealed to, simply establishes the fact that &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; stood in the Sept. version of his day, since he made use of this version and not of the original text. Moreover, we cannot say with Ewald, that this was the last place in which the time could be overlooked; for it is perfectly evident that Nahash commenced the siege of Jabesh shortly after the election of Saul at Mizpeh, as we may infer from the verb &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, when taken in connection with the fact implied in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>, that he had commenced the war with the Israelites before this. And lastly, it is much more probable that the lxx changed &#1499;&#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513; into &#1499;&#1502;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;, than that the Hebrew readers of the Old Testament should have altered &#1499;&#1502;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513; into &#1499;&#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;, without defining the time more precisely by &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, or some other number.)<p> - according to Josephus the metropolis of Gilead, and probably situated by the Wady Jabes (see at <a href="/judges/21-8.htm">Judges 21:8</a>); from which we may see that he must have penetrated very far into the territory of the Israelites. The inhabitants of Jabesh petitioned the Ammonites in their distress, "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee;" i.e., grant us favourable terms, and we will submit.</body></html>
