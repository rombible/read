(See <a href="/context/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1Samuel 30:7-8</a>.) It has been suggested by eminent Biblical scholars that after the murder of Ahimelech and the flight of Abiathar to David, Saul removed the national Sanctuary from desecrated Nob, and established it at Gibeon, where, during the first year of David’s reign, we find the Tabernacle, with Zadok, son of Ahitub, of the house of Eleazar, acting as high priest—probably placed in that office by Saul. This would account for the frequent reference in the time of David to two high priests, Zadok and Abiathar: Zadok, the high priest appointed by Saul, for a considerable period alone in charge of the Tabernacle; and Abiathar, who fled from Nob with the ephod and the sacred Urim, acknowledged by David as high priest, when the kingdom was restored eventually under one head. These two seemed to have divided the honours and responsibilities of the high priesthood. (See <a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm" title="And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;">2Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm" title="And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.">2Samuel 15:24</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-29.htm" title="Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.">2Samuel 15:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-35.htm" title="And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.">2Samuel 15:35</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-11.htm" title="And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,">1Chronicles 15:11</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-16.htm" title="And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;">1Chronicles 18:16</a>.)<p>This Zadok, we may assume, “enquired” for Saul:·some suppose by means of an ephod made in imitation of the ancient breastplate with the Urim in possession of Abiathar; but, as may be readily imagined, no response was received. It is also likely enough that some “prophets”—so called—trained, not improbably, in the school of Samuel, were present with Saul. These, too, of course, received no Divine message, either by voice or in dreams.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm" title="And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.">1 Samuel 28:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Saul inquired of the Lord — </span>This seems to contradict what is affirmed <a href="/1_chronicles/10-14.htm" title="And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.">1 Chronicles 10:14</a>, that <span class="ital">he did not inquire of the Lord, </span>which is assigned as the reason why the Lord slew him. But Rabbi Kimchi, and others, thus reconcile these two places. That since he did not continue to inquire of him, but went to a diviner, it was all one as if he had not inquired at all; for he did it faintly, coldly, and indifferently. A learned Jew, Samuel Laniado, remarks here: “He whose heart is perfect with God, lifts up his eyes unto him, and fixes them on him; hoping in him, though he doth not presently hear him; and perseveres in his expectation and confidence, firmly setting a resolution to wait upon him. But so did not Saul, who was remiss and negligent, saying in his heart, If God will not hear me, I will go and consult a familiar spirit.” <span class="ital">The Lord answered him not — </span>Nor is it to be wondered that he should not answer a man of such a disposition. <span class="ital">Neither by dreams — </span>By which perhaps he prayed that God would inform him. <span class="ital">Nor by Urim — </span>It appears by this, that, Abiathar having fled to David and taken the ephod with him, Saul had set up another high-priest, and made an ephod in imitation of the sacred one, not considering the peculiar sanctity of that which God had appointed, and by which alone he had promised to manifest himself. <span class="ital">Nor by prophets — </span>A school of whom, no doubt, was still remaining at Ramah, over which Samuel had presided.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-6 David could not refuse Achish without danger. If he promised assistance, and then stood neuter, or went over to the Israelites, he would behave with ingratitude and treachery. If he fought against Israel, he would sin greatly. It seemed impossible that he should get out of this difficulty with a clear conscience; but his evasive answer, intended to gain time, was not consistent with the character of an Israelite indeed. Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience. In his distress, Saul inquired of the Lord. He did not seek in faith, but with a double, unstable mind. Saul had put the law in force against those that had familiar spirits, Ex 22:18. Many seem zealous against, sin, when they are any way hurt by it, who have no concern for the glory of God, nor any dislike of sin as sin. Many seem enemies to sin in others, while they indulge it in themselves. Saul will drive the devil out of his kingdom, yet harbours him in his heart by envy and malice.

The explanation of this apparent discrepancy is to be found in the fact that inquiring of the familiar spirit was positively antagonistic to inquiring of the Lord. That Saul received no answer - when he "inquired of the Lord" by dreams, which was an immediate revelation to himself; by Urim, which was an answer through the high priest clothed in the ephod; or by prophets, which was an answer conveyed through some seer speaking by the Word of the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a> - was a reason for self-abasement and self-examination, to find out and, if possible, remove the cause, but was no justification whatever of his sin in asking counsel of familiar spirits. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. the Philistines &#8230; pitched in Shunem&#8212;Having collected their forces for a last grand effort, they marched up from the seacoast and encamped in the "valley of Jezreel."

This conjecture is supported by the double high-priesthood of Zadok and Abiathar in David’s reign (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm" title="And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;">2 Samuel 8:17</a>, &c.), which may be accounted for by supposing that David allowed Zadok to retain the office to which Saul had elevated him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following points may be noted with respect to the obscure question of the <span class="ital">Urim</span>, or <span class="ital">Urim and Thummim</span>.

There are no directions for making them; it is implied that they were already in existence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) The purpose of this mysterious instrument is clear. It was a means by which the will of Jehovah was ascertained through the high-priest. The present passage is the only mention by name of its use after the entry into Canaan, though it is implied in ch. <a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm" title="And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.

A plausible conjecture connects them with the symbol of Truth worn by the priest-judges of Egypt, and the symbol of Light worn by members of the priestly caste.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">e</span>) The method of use must remain an enigma. The most probable theories are either (1) that they were consecrated objects by gazing on which the high-priest passed into a state of spiritual ecstasy, and purified from selfish and worldly thoughts became receptive of a supernatural illumination: or (2) that they were a special means of casting lots.
