It is also quite conceivable, too, that whispers respecting David s expeditions during the past year were current in some Philistine quarters. The eyes of the king, thought these more far-seeing nobles, were blinded by his partiality for his military vassal. (See Note on <a href="/1_samuel/29-3.htm" title="Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?

Achish evidently understood David as promising that he would do his best to serve him. Delaney thinks that David gave Achish a doubtful answer, because he would not resolve upon so extraordinary a step without consulting God, either by his priest or his prophet. And that, as he proceeded so far as to attend Achish to Aphek, the place appointed for the assembling of the Philistine forces, there is no reason to doubt that he went thither with honest intentions toward his protector, and that he did it by the divine permission.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-6 David could not refuse Achish without danger. If he promised assistance, and then stood neuter, or went over to the Israelites, he would behave with ingratitude and treachery. If he fought against Israel, he would sin greatly. It seemed impossible that he should get out of this difficulty with a clear conscience; but his evasive answer, intended to gain time, was not consistent with the character of an Israelite indeed. Troubles are terrors to the children of disobedience. In his distress, Saul inquired of the Lord. He did not seek in faith, but with a double, unstable mind. Saul had put the law in force against those that had familiar spirits, Ex 22:18. Many seem zealous against, sin, when they are any way hurt by it, who have no concern for the glory of God, nor any dislike of sin as sin. Many seem enemies to sin in others, while they indulge it in themselves. Saul will drive the devil out of his kingdom, yet harbours him in his heart by envy and malice. How foolish to consult those whom, according to God's law, he had endeavoured to root out!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt know ... - David dissembled (compare also <a href="/1_samuel/29-8.htm">1 Samuel 29:8</a>), hoping, no doubt, that something would happen to prevent his fighting against his king and country.<p>Keeper of mine head - Captain of his bodyguard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Though it is likely he would have managed his affairs with all possible regard and care of Achish’s person, to whom alone, upon the matter, David stood obliged, and not to the rest of the Philistines, who had an ill opinion of him, as we shall see. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore; </span> for that valour which I doubt not thou wilt show on my behalf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of mine head, </span> i.e. of my body and life, the captain of my life-guard. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David said to Achish, surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do,....

David’s answer is designedly ambiguous. He is placed in a perplexing dilemma. It seems as though he must either fight against his own nation, or appear false to his liege lord Achish. The difficulty was providentially solved by the suspicion of the Philistine princes (<a href="/1_samuel/29-3.htm" title="Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?

The occasion of this attack is not mentioned, as being a matter of indifference in relation to the chief object of the history; but it is no doubt to be sought for in plundering incursions made by these tribes into the land of Israel. For David would hardly have entered upon such a war in the situation in which he was placed at that time without some such occasion, seeing that it would be almost sure to bring him into suspicion with Achish, and endanger his safety. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, "he advanced," the verb being used, as it frequently is, to denote the advance of an army against a people or town (see at <a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>). At the same time, the tribes which he attacked may have had their seat upon the mountain plateau in the northern portion of the desert of Paran, so that David was obliged to march up to reach them. &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, to invade for the purpose of devastation and plunder. Geshuri is a tribe mentioned in <a href="/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2</a> as living in the south of the territory of the Philistines, and is a different tribe from the Geshurites in the north-east of Gilead (<a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>, <a href="/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>). These are the only passages in which they are mentioned. The Gerzites, or Gizrites according to the Keri, are entirely unknown. Bonfrere and Clericus suppose them to be the Gerreni spoken of in 2 Macc. 13:24, who inhabited the town of Gerra, between Rhinocolura and Pelusium (Strabo, xvi. 760), or Gerron (Ptol. iv. 5). This conjecture is a possible one, but is very uncertain nevertheless, as the Gerzites certainly dwelt somewhere in the desert of Arabia. At any rate Grotius and Ewald cannot be correct in their opinion that they were the inhabitants of Gezer (<a href="/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>). The Amalekites were the remnant of this old hereditary foe of the Israelites, who had taken to flight on Saul's war of extermination, and had now assembled again (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8-9</a>). "For they inhabit the land, where you go from of old to Shur, even to the land of Egypt." The &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; may be explained from the fact that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;&#1498; is not adverbial here, but is construed according to its form as an infinitive: literally, "where from of old thy coming is to Shur." &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; cannot have crept into the text through a copyist's mistake, as such a mistake would not have found its way into all the MSS. The fact that the early translators did not render the word proves nothing against its genuineness, but merely shows that the translators regarded it as superfluous. Moreover, the Alexandrian text is decidedly faulty here, and &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is confounded with &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;. Shur is the desert of Jifar, which is situated in front of Egypt (as in <a href="/1_samuel/15-7.htm">1 Samuel 15:7</a>). These tribes were nomads, and had large flocks, which David took with him as booty when he had smitten the tribes themselves. After his return, David betook himself to Achish, to report to the Philistian king concerning his enterprise, and deceive him as to its true character. </body></html>
