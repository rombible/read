The sense of the passage there is, the heads of the king and his three sons were cut off, and their armour stripped from their bodies.

It is of little consequence by what means we die, or what is done with our dead bodies. If our souls are saved, our bodies will be raised incorruptible and glorious; but not to fear His wrath, who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is the extreme of folly and wickedness. How useless is the respect of fellow-creatures to those who are suffering the wrath of God! While pompous funerals, grand monuments, and he praises of men, honour the memory of the deceased, the soul may be suffering in the regions of darkness and despair!

The fierce joy of the Philistines over the fallen Saul proves how great had been their fear of him, and how successful he had been in breaking their yoke off Israel's neck.

Whether it was divided among the various shrines of Astarte, or whether it was all placed in her famous temple at Askelon, described by Herodotus (1:105) as the most ancient of the fanes of the Syrian Venus, is uncertain. The former view agrees best with the Hebrew text and with what is said in <a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>, where we have the additional information that they suspended Saul's head in the temple of Dagon. <span class="cmt_word">They fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan, as also the bodies of his sons</span> (ver. 12). Beth-shan or Scythopolis lies about four miles from the Jordan on the west, and twelve miles south of the lake of Tiberias. It is almost in a straight line to the west of Mahanaim, and must have been at once occupied by the Philistines, and as they hung the bodies of the fallen king and his sons on its wall, they evidently intended to retain it.

In <a href="/1_chronicles/10-3.htm">1 Chronicles 10:3</a> the Sept. rendering is &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and that of the Vulgate et vulneraverunt jaculis. The translators have therefore derived &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and then given a free rendering to the other words. But this rendering is overthrown by the word &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;, very, vehemently, to say nothing of the fact that the verb &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1500;&#1492; cannot be proved to be ever used in the sense of wounding. If Saul had been so severely wounded that he could not kill himself, and therefore asked his armour-bearer to slay him, as Thenius supposes, he would not have had the strength to pierce himself with his sword when the armour-bearer refused. The further conjecture of Thenius, that the Hebrew text should be read thus, in accordance with the lxx, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, "he was wounded in the region of the gall," is opposed by the circumstance that &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; is not the gall or region of the gall, but what is under the &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, or breast cartilage, viz., the abdomen and bowels.)<p>and called upon his armour-bearer to pierce him with the sword, "lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and play with me," i.e., cool their courage upon me by maltreating me. But as the armour-bearer would not do this, because he was very much afraid, since he was supposed to be answerable for the king's life, Saul inflicted death upon himself with his sword; whereupon the armour-bearer also fell upon his sword and died with his king, so that on that day Saul and this three sons and his armour-bearer all died; also "all his men" (for which we have "all his house" in the Chronicles), i.e., not all the warriors who went out with him to battle, but all the king's servants, or all the members of his house, sc., who had taken part in the battle. Neither Abner nor his son Ishbosheth was included, for the latter was not in the battle; and although the former was Saul's cousin and commander-in-chief (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50-51</a>), he did not belong to his house or servants.</body></html>
