So desperate had been the valour with which the King and his gallant sons had defended their last positions on the hill, that night had fallen ere the din of battle ceased. Nor were the enemy aware of the completeness of their success until the morning dawn revealed to the soldiers as they went over the scene, the great ones who were numbered among the slain. In the mean time the Amalekite had found and carried off the crown and royal bracelet. Only the bodies of Saul and the princes, and the armourbearer, are spoken of here. The crown royal, which would have formed so splendid a trophy, was already taken.<p>“O Saul,<p>How ghastly didst thou look, on thine own sword<p>Expiring: in Gilboa, from that hour<p>Ne’er visited with rain from heaven, nor dew.”<p>DANTE: <span class= "ital">Pura. </span>12<p>The curse of barrenness alluded to by the great Italian poet was called down on the hill where the first anointed of the Lord fell, and where the body was stripped and dismembered by the triumphant foe (<a href="/2_samuel/1-21.htm" title="You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, on you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.">2Samuel 1:21</a>). Quickly the tidings were told, we learn, in the capital of Gath, and proclaimed through the streets of Askelon.<p>The historian with extreme brevity records the savage treatment of the royal remains, which, after all, was but a reprisal.

It is of little consequence by what means we die, or what is done with our dead bodies. If our souls are saved, our bodies will be raised incorruptible and glorious; but not to fear His wrath, who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is the extreme of folly and wickedness. How useless is the respect of fellow-creatures to those who are suffering the wrath of God! While pompous funerals, grand monuments, and he praises of men, honour the memory of the deceased, the soul may be suffering in the regions of darkness and despair!

When the archers (&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is an explanatory apposition to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) hit him, i.e., overtook him, he was greatly alarmed at them (&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, from &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;),<p>(Note: The lxx have adopted the rendering &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, they wounded him in the abdomen, whilst the Vulgate rendering is vulneratus est vehementer a sagittariis. In <a href="/1_chronicles/10-3.htm">1 Chronicles 10:3</a> the Sept. rendering is &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, and that of the Vulgate et vulneraverunt jaculis. The translators have therefore derived &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;  equals  &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and then given a free rendering to the other words. But this rendering is overthrown by the word &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;, very, vehemently, to say nothing of the fact that the verb &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; or &#1495;&#1500;&#1492; cannot be proved to be ever used in the sense of wounding. If Saul had been so severely wounded that he could not kill himself, and therefore asked his armour-bearer to slay him, as Thenius supposes, he would not have had the strength to pierce himself with his sword when the armour-bearer refused. The further conjecture of Thenius, that the Hebrew text should be read thus, in accordance with the lxx, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, "he was wounded in the region of the gall," is opposed by the circumstance that &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; is not the gall or region of the gall, but what is under the &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, or breast cartilage, viz., the abdomen and bowels.)<p>and called upon his armour-bearer to pierce him with the sword, "lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and play with me," i.e., cool their courage upon me by maltreating me. But as the armour-bearer would not do this, because he was very much afraid, since he was supposed to be answerable for the king's life, Saul inflicted death upon himself with his sword; whereupon the armour-bearer also fell upon his sword and died with his king, so that on that day Saul and this three sons and his armour-bearer all died; also "all his men" (for which we have "all his house" in the Chronicles), i.e., not all the warriors who went out with him to battle, but all the king's servants, or all the members of his house, sc., who had taken part in the battle. Neither Abner nor his son Ishbosheth was included, for the latter was not in the battle; and although the former was Saul's cousin and commander-in-chief (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50-51</a>), he did not belong to his house or servants.</body></html>
