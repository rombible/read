All seemed against him. His army was routed, his sons were dead, his faithful captains and companions were gone, and these bow-men were shooting at him from a distance where his strong arm could not reach them. Gradually weakened through loss of blood—perhaps with the words he had heard only a few hours before at En-dor from the dead prophet ringing in his ears, “To-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me”—the great undaunted courage at last failed him, and he turned to his armourbearer, who was still by his side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/31.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/31-3.htm" title="And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.">1 Samuel 31:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">The archers hit him </span>— Hebrews <span class="greekheb">ימצאהו</span> <span class="ital">jim-stauhu, found him. </span>Houbigant renders it, <span class="ital">rushed upon him. </span>It seems by this that the Philistines gained the battle, chiefly by the advantage of their archers. Probably these were some hired troops, for we meet with no mention before this of any archers in any of the Philistines’ armies or battles; and it seems to have been a way of fighting that Saul and the Israelites were not prepared for, and therefore they were soon thrown into confusion by it. “The use of the bow, however,” says Dr. Dodd, “was not unknown. Jonathan is celebrated for his skill and dexterity in it; and so were some of the worthies who resorted to David; but it seems not yet to have been brought into common practice, if, as has been collected from <a href="/2_samuel/1-18.htm" title="(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)">2 Samuel 1:18</a>, David, after this battle, had the Israelites taught the use of it.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:1-7 We cannot judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by the manner of their death; for in that, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked. Saul, when sorely wounded, and unable to resist or to flee, expressed no concern about his never-dying soul; but only desired that the Philistines might not insult over him, or put him to pain, and he became his own murderer. As it is the grand deceit of the devil, to persuade sinners, under great difficulties, to fly to this last act of desperation, it is well to fortify the mind against it, by a serious consideration of its sinfulness before God, and its miserable consequences in society. But our security is not in ourselves. Let us seek protection from Him who keepeth Israel. Let us watch and pray; and take unto us the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He was sore wounded - Better, "he was sore afraid" (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>).

However, that officer refused to do so. Saul then falling on the point of his sword killed himself; and the armor bearer, who, according to Jewish writers, was Doeg, following the example of his master, put an end to his life also.

In <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a> the verb is rendered "be in anguish." The meaning is that Saul, finding himself surrounded by these archers, and that he could neither escape nor come to close quarters with them, and die fighting, ordered his armour bearer to kill him, that he might be spared the degradation of being slain by  "uncircumcised" heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Abuse me.</span> This verb is translated <span class="accented">mock</span> in <a href="/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>. "Maltreat" would be a better rendering in both places, and also in <a href="/judges/19-25.htm">Judges 19:25</a>, where, too, the word occurs. Its exact meaning is to practise upon another all that passion, lust, anger, or malice dictate. Probably Saul thought that they would treat him as they had previously treated Samson (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David returned to Ziklag, he sent portions of the booty to the elders of Judah, to his friends, with this message: "Behold, here ye have a blessing of the booty of the enemies of Jehovah" (which we took from the enemies of Jehovah); and this he did, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-31.htm">1 Samuel 30:31</a>, to all the places in which he had wandered with his men, i.e., where he had wandered about during his flight from Saul, and in which he had no doubt received assistance. Sending these gifts could not fail to make the elders of these cities well disposed towards him, and so to facilitate his recognition as king after the death of Saul, which occurred immediately afterwards. Some of these places may have been plundered by the Amalekites, since they had invaded the Negeb of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>). The cities referred to were Bethel, - not the Bethel so often mentioned, the present Beitin, in the tribe of Benjamin, but Betheul (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-30.htm">1 Chronicles 4:30</a>) or Bethul, in the tribe of Simeon (<a href="/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>), which Knobel supposes to be Elusa or el Khalasa (see at <a href="/joshua/15-30.htm">Joshua 15:30</a>). The reading &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1; in the lxx is a worthless conjecture. Ramah of the south, which was allotted to the tribe of Simeon, has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="/joshua/19-8.htm">Joshua 19:8</a>). Jattir has been preserved in the ruins of Attir, on the southern portion of the Mountains of Judah (see at <a href="/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>). Aror is still to be seen in ruins, viz., in the foundations of walls built in enormous stones in Wady Arara, where there are many cavities for holding water, about three hours E.S.E. of Bersaba, and twenty miles to the south of Hebron (vid., Rob. Pal. ii. p. 620, and v. de Velde, Mem. p. 288). Siphmoth (or Shiphmoth, according to several MSS) is altogether unknown. It may probably be referred to again in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27</a>, where Zabdi is called the Shiphmite; but it is certainly not to be identified with Sepham, on the north-east of the sea of Galilee (<a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-10.htm">Numbers 34:10-11</a>), as Thenius supposes. Eshtemoa has been preserved in the village of Semua, with ancient ruins, on the south-western portion of the mountains of Judah (see at <a href="/joshua/15-50.htm">Joshua 15:50</a>). Racal is never mentioned again, and is entirely unknown. The lxx have five different names instead of this, the last being Carmel, into which Thenius proposes to alter Racal. But this can hardly be done with propriety, as the lxx also introduced the Philistian Gath, which certainly does not belong here; whilst in <a href="/1_samuel/30-30.htm">1 Samuel 30:30</a> they have totally different names, some of which are decidedly wrong. The cities of the Jerahmeelites and Kenites were situated in the Negeb of Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>), but their names cannot be traced.</body></html>
