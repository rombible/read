This leads us to the conclusion that the power of Samuel, if not exclusively, was chiefly exercised among the southern tribes. The whole subsequent story of the chosen people seems to tell us that the religion of the Eternal at an early date became corrupted m the north of the Promised Land, and that the restoration of faith and purification of life—the result of the great work of Samuel—was so much less marked in the northern than in the southern tribes, that when the strong hand of Solomon was removed, a formal secession from the southern league at once took place. This was followed by a rapid deterioration both in faith and practice in the northern kingdom of Israel.<p>The places mentioned as the centres where Samuel “judged” were all holy sites, and at different periods of the year, no doubt, were crowded with pilgrims from distant parts of the land.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.">1 Samuel 7:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Judged Israel in all those places — </span>He went to those several places, in compliance with the people’s desire, whose convenience he was willing to purchase with his own trouble, as an itinerant judge and preacher; and by his presence in several parts, he could the better observe and rectify all sorts of miscarriages and abuses.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 In this great revival of true religion, the ark was neither removed to Shiloh, nor placed with the tabernacle any where else.
