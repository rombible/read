For a very long period—probably for at least twenty years after the decisive battle of Eben-ezer—Samuel, as “judge,” exercised the chief authority in Israel. The time at length arrived when, convinced by clear Divine monition that it was best for the people that a king should rule over them, Samuel the seer, then advanced in years, voluntarily laid down his high office in favour of the new king, Saul; but his influence remained, and his authority, whenever he chose to exercise it, seems to have continued undiminished, and on momentous occasions (see, for instance, <a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.

In putting Agag to death (<a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>) he even claimed a higher authority, and though he voluntarily left as a rule all civil and military matters to the king, yet he never actually resigned the supreme control, and on fitting occasions even exercised it. It was, however, practically within narrow limits that he personally exercised his functions as judge in settling the causes of the people; for <span class="cmt_word">Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh</span> were all situated in the tribe of Benjamin. Both Bethel and Mizpah were holy spots, and so also, probably, was Gilgal; and therefore we may conclude that it was the famous sanctuary of that name (see <a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>), and not the Gilgal mentioned, in <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>. For this latter, situated to the southwest of Shiloh, near the road to Jerusalem, had no religious importance, and would not, therefore, attract so many people to it as one that was frequented for sacrifice. Probably, too, it was upon the occasion of religious solemnities that Samuel visited these places, and heard the people's suits. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they had assembled together here, "they drew water and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord." Drawing water and pouring it out before Jehovah was a symbolical act, which has been thus correctly explained by the Chaldee, on the whole: "They poured out their heart like water in penitence before the Lord." This is evident from the figurative expressions, "poured out like water," in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>, and "pour out thy heart like water," in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>, which are used to denote inward dissolution through pain, misery, and distress (see <a href="/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>). Hence the pouring out of water before God was a symbolical representation of the temporal and spiritual distress in which they were at the time, - a practical confession before God, "Behold, we are before Thee like water that has been poured out;" and as it was their own sin and rebellion against God that had brought this distress upon them, it was at the same time a confession of their misery, and an act of the deepest humiliation before the Lord. They gave a still further practical expression to this humiliation by fasting (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), as a sign of their inward distress of mind on account of their sin, and an oral confession of their sin against the Lord. By the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which is added to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they said "there," i.e., at Mizpeh, the oral confession of their sin is formally separated from the two symbolical acts of humiliation before God, though by this very separation it is practically placed on a par with them. What they did symbolically by the pouring out of water and fasting, they explained and confirmed by their verbal confession. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is never an adverb of time signifying "then;" neither in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>, nor <a href="/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>. "And thus Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpeh." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; does not mean "he became judge" (Mich. and others), any more than "he punished every one according to his iniquity" (Thenius, after David Kimchi). Judging the people neither consisted in a censure pronounced by Samuel afterwards, nor in absolution granted to the penitent after they had made a confession of their sin, but in the fact that Samuel summoned the nation to Mizpeh to humble itself before Jehovah, and there secured for it, through his intercession, the forgiveness of its sin, and a renewal of the favour of its God, and thus restored the proper relation between Israel and its God, so that the Lord could proceed to vindicate His people's rights against their foes.<p>When the Philistines heard of the gathering of the Israelites at Mizpeh (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8</a>), their princes went up against Israel to make war upon it; and the Israelites, in their fear of the Philistines, entreated Samuel, "Do not cease to cry for us to the Lord our God, that He may save us out of the hand of the Philistines." <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>. "And Samuel took a milk-lamb (a lamb that was still sucking, probably, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-27.htm">Leviticus 22:27</a>, a lamb seven days old), and offered it whole as a burnt-offering to the Lord." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is used adverbially, according to its original meaning as an adverb, "whole." The Chaldee has not given the word at all, probably because the translators regarded it as pleonastic, since every burnt-offering was consumed upon the altar whole, and consequently the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; was sometimes used in a substantive sense, as synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-21.htm">Psalm 51:21</a>). But in the passage before us, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is not synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, but simply affirms that the lamb was offered upon the altar without being cut up or divided. Samuel selected a young lamb for the burnt-offering, not "as being the purest and most innocent kind of sacrificial animal," - for it cannot possibly be shown that very young animals were regarded as purer than those that were full-grown, - but as being the most suitable to represent the nation that had wakened up to new life through its conversion to the Lord, and was, as it were, new-born. For the burnt-offering represented the man, who consecrated therein his life and labour to the Lord. The sacrifice was the substratum for prayer. When Samuel offered it, he cried to the Lord for the children of Israel; and the Lord "answered," i.e., granted, his prayer.</body></html>
