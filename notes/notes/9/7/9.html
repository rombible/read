When sinners begin to repent and reform, they must expect that Satan will muster all his force against them, and set his instruments at work to the utmost, to oppose and discourage them. The Israelites earnestly beg Samuel to pray for them. Oh what a comfort it is to all believers, that our great Intercessor above never ceases, is never silent! for he always appears in the presence of God for us. Samuel's sacrifice, without his prayer, had been an empty shadow. God gave a gracious answer. And Samuel erected a memorial of this victory, to the glory of God, and to encourage Israel. Through successive generations, the church of God has had cause to set up Eben-ezers for renewed deliverances; neither outward persecutions nor inward corruptions have prevailed against her, because hitherto the Lord hath helped her: and he will help, even to the end of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Samuel's preparation for intercessory prayer, namely, the offering up an atoning sacrifice, is most significant (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9-10</a>).

They discerned in it the rising spirit of religious patriotism among the Israelites that was prepared to throw off the yoke of their domination. Anxious to crush it at the first, they made a sudden incursion while the Israelites were in the midst of their solemn celebration. Unprepared for resistance, they besought Samuel to supplicate the divine interposition to save them from their enemies. The prophet's prayers and sacrifice were answered by such a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning that the assailants, panic-struck, were disordered and fled. The Israelites, recognizing the hand of God, rushed courageously on the foe they had so much dreaded and committed such immense havoc, that the Philistines did not for long recover from this disastrous blow. This brilliant victory secured peace and independence to Israel for twenty years, as well as the restitution of the usurped territory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It might be a <span class="ital">sucking lamb</span>, though it was more than eight days old, and so that law, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm" title="The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God.

The lamb was at least seven days old, for so the law required (<a href="/leviticus/22-27.htm">Leviticus 22:27</a>), but probably not much older; for the word, a rare one, occurring elsewhere only in <a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>, means something small and tender: this then <span class="cmt_word">he offered for a burnt offering wholly unto Jehovah.</span> The A.V. translates in this way because <span class="accented">chalil</span>, "whole," is masculine, while <span class="accented">olah</span>, "a burnt offering," is feminine; but <span class="accented">chalil</span> had in course of time come to be used as a substantive (<a href="/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/13-16.htm">Deuteronomy 13:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>), and is really here in opposition to <span class="accented">olah</span>, and so the two together signify "a whole burnt offering," and clearly indicate that the lamb was entirely consumed by fire. <span class="accented">Olah</span> means <span class="accented">that which ascends</span>, and symbolised devotion and consecration to God. <span class="accented">Chalil</span> intensified this signification, and showed that all was God's, and no part whatsoever reserved for the priest or the offerer. And thus then Samuel's burnt offering implied that the people gave themselves unreservedly to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehovah heard him</span>. Really, "Jehovah answered him," by the thunder mentioned in ver. 10. For thunder was regarded as God's voice (<a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>), and in <a href="/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>. we have a poetic description of its majesty and power. Express mention is also made in <a href="/psalms/99-6.htm">Psalm 99:6</a> of Jehovah having thus answered the prayers of Moses (<a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>), and of Samuel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Purification of Israel from idolatry. - Twenty years passed away from that time forward, while the ark remained at Kirjath-jearim, and all Israel mourned after Jehovah. Then Samuel said to them, "If ye turn to the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods from the midst of you, and the Astartes, and direct your heart firmly upon the Lord, and serve Him only, that He may save you out of the hand of the Philistines." And the Israelites listened to this appeal. The single clauses of <a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a> are connected together by vav consec., and are not to be separated from one another. There is no gap between these verses; but they contain the same closely and logically connected thought,<p>(Note: There is no force at all in the proofs which Thenius has adduced of a gap between <a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>. It by no means follows, that because the Philistines had brought back the ark, their rule over the Israelites had ceased, so as to make the words "he will deliver you," etc., incomprehensible. Moreover, the appearance of Samuel as judge does not presuppose that his assumption of this office must necessarily have been mentioned before. As a general rule, there was no such formal assumption of the office, and this would be least of all the case with Samuel, who had been recognised as an accredited prophet of Jehovah (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>.). And lastly, the reference to idols, and to their being put away in consequence of Samuel's appeal, is intelligible enough, without any express account of their falling into idolatry, if we bear in mind, on the one hand, the constant inclination of the people to serve other gods, and if we observe, on the other hand, that Samuel called upon the people to turn to the Lord with all their heart and serve Him alone, which not only does not preclude, but actually implies, the outward continuance of the worship of Jehovah.)<p>which may be arranged in one period in the following manner: "And it came to pass, when the days multiplied from the time that the ark remained at Kirjath-jearim, and grew to twenty years, and the whole house of Israel mourned after Jehovah, that Samuel said," etc. The verbs &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, are merely continuations of the infinitive &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, and the main sentence is resumed in the words &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. The contents of the verses require that the clauses should be combined in this manner. The statement that twenty years had passed can only be understood on the supposition that some kind of turning-point ensued at the close of that time. The complaining of the people after Jehovah was no such turning-point, but became one simply from the fact that this complaining was followed by some result. This result is described in <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>. It consisted in the fact that Samuel exhorted the people to put away the strange gods (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>); and that when the people listened to his exhortation (<a href="/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>), he helped them to gain a victory over the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>.). &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, from &#1504;&#1492;&#1492;, to lament or complain (<a href="/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>). "The phrase, to lament after God, is taken from human affairs, when one person follows another with earnest solicitations and complaints, until he at length assents. We have an example of this in the Syrophenician woman in <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/15.htm">Matthew 15</a>." (Seb. Schmidt). The meaning "to assemble together," which is the one adopted by Gesenius, is forced upon the word from the Chaldee &#1488;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;&#1497;, and it cannot be shown that the word was ever used in this sense in Hebrew. Samuel's appeal in <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a> recalls to mind <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>, and <a href="/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>; but the words, "If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts," assume that the turning of the people to the Lord their God had already inwardly commenced, and indeed, as the participle &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; expresses duration, had commenced as a permanent thing, and simply demand that the inward turning of the heart to God should be manifested outwardly as well, by the putting away of all their idols, and should thus be carried out to completion. The "strange gods" (see <a href="/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>) are described in <a href="/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a> as "Baalim." On Baalim and Ashtaroth, see at <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, <a href="/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>. &#1500;&#1489; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to direct the heart firmly: see <a href="/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-19.htm">2 Chronicles 30:19</a>. </body></html>
