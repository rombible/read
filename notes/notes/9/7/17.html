It must be remembered that at this period there was no national sanctuary, no formal seat of worship, where the high priest and his attendant priests and Levites served. The Ark, we know, was in safe keeping in the “city of woods,” Kirjath-jearim, but it was in private custody; and we hear of no priests and Levites, of no ritual or religious observances, in connection with the long sojourn of the holy Ark in that place. It is probable that the sacred vessels and furniture had been saved from the destruction of Shiloh by Samuel. These were, very likely, in the prophet-judge’s safe keeping at Bamah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm" title="And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.">1 Samuel 7:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Built an altar — </span>That, by joining sacrifices with his prayers, he might the better obtain direction and assistance from God upon all emergencies. And this was done by prophetical inspiration, as appears by God’s acceptance of the sacrifices offered upon it. Indeed, Shiloh being now laid waste, and no other place yet appointed for them to bring their offerings to, the law which obliged them to one place was for the present suspended. Therefore, as the patriarchs did, he built an altar where he lived; and that not only for the use of his own family, but for the good of the country, who resorted to it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:13-17 In this great revival of true religion, the ark was neither removed to Shiloh, nor placed with the tabernacle any where else. This disregard to the Levitical institutions showed that their typical meaning formed their chief use; and when that was overlooked, they became a lifeless service, not to be compared with repentance, faith, and the love of God and man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there he built an altar - Whether this altar was in connection with the tabernacle or not we have no means of deciding, since we are in complete ignorance as to where the tabernacle was at this time, or who was High Priest, or where he resided. It is quite possible that Samuel may have removed the tabernacle from Shiloh to some place near to Ramah; and indeed it is in itself improbable that, brought up as he was from infancy in the service of the tabernacle, he should have left it. At the beginning of Solomon's reign we know it was at Gibeon, close to Raimah <a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/1-6.htm">2 Chronicles 1:6</a>. If the tabernacle had been at Shiloh at this time, it is likely that Shiloh would have been one of the places at which Samuel judged lsrael. But Shiloh was probably waste, and perhaps unsafe on account of the Philistines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen&#8212;on an open spot between the town and "the crag" (some well-known rock in the neighborhood). A huge stone pillar was erected as a monument of their victory (Le 26:1). The name&#8212;Eben-ezer&#8212;is thought to have been written on the face of it.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That by joining sacrifices with his prayers he might the better obtain direction and assistance from God upon all emergencies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> It was unlawful to build another altar for sacrifice besides that before the tabernacle, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm" title="But to the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation shall you seek, and thither you shall come:">Deu 12:5</a>,13</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> This was in part excused by the confusion of those times, wherein the tabernacle and its altar were destroyed, as is most probable; but most fully, because this was done by prophetical inspiration, and Divine dispensation, as appears by God’s approbation and acceptance of the sacrifices offered upon it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his return was to Ramah,....

Shiloh being destroyed, and no place appointed for the tabernacle and altar, the Jews say, high places for a private altar were lawful, and even for one that was not a priest to offer; these things, though settled by law, yet were for a time dispensed with, until things could be fixed in their proper place and order. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And his return <i>was</i> to Ramah; for there <i>was</i> his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> altar unto the LORD.</span><p>(i) Which was not contrary to the Law: for as yet a certain place was not appointed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">to Ramah</span>] See note on ch. <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1 Samuel 1:1</a>.

At this time there was especial need for such altars. The established worship at Shiloh had been swept away, the town destroyed, the priests put to the sword, and the ark, though restored, was resting in a private dwelling. Probably Samuel had saved the sacred vessels, and much even of the tabernacle, but no mention of them is here made. We see, however, both in the erection of this altar and all through Samuel's life, that the Aaronic priesthood was in abeyance, and that he was not only prophet and judge, but also priest. In thus restoring the priesthood in his own person he was justified not merely by his powers as prophet, but by necessity. Gradually, with more prosperous times, matters returned to their regular channel; but even when Ahiah, the grandson of Eli, was with Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>), he was employed not for the offering of sacrifice, but for divining with the Urim and Thummim. On a most important occasion the offering of sacrifice is spoken of as undoubtedly Samuel's right, and when he delayed his coming no mention is made of a priest, but Saul is said to have offered the victim himself (<a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>). It is plain, therefore, that we must not tie down the priesthood too tightly to the house of Aaron; for throughout there lies in the background the idea of a higher priesthood, and with this Samuel was invested, as being a type of him who is a Priest forever after the order of Melchisedek (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As soon as they took to flight, the Israelites advanced from Mizpeh, and pursued and smote them to below Beth-car.
