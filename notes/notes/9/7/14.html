SAMUEL'S CONDUCT AS JUDGE (vers. 15-17). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they had assembled together here, "they drew water and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord." Drawing water and pouring it out before Jehovah was a symbolical act, which has been thus correctly explained by the Chaldee, on the whole: "They poured out their heart like water in penitence before the Lord." This is evident from the figurative expressions, "poured out like water," in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>, and "pour out thy heart like water," in <a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>, which are used to denote inward dissolution through pain, misery, and distress (see <a href="/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>). Hence the pouring out of water before God was a symbolical representation of the temporal and spiritual distress in which they were at the time, - a practical confession before God, "Behold, we are before Thee like water that has been poured out;" and as it was their own sin and rebellion against God that had brought this distress upon them, it was at the same time a confession of their misery, and an act of the deepest humiliation before the Lord. They gave a still further practical expression to this humiliation by fasting (&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;), as a sign of their inward distress of mind on account of their sin, and an oral confession of their sin against the Lord. By the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which is added to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "they said "there," i.e., at Mizpeh, the oral confession of their sin is formally separated from the two symbolical acts of humiliation before God, though by this very separation it is practically placed on a par with them. What they did symbolically by the pouring out of water and fasting, they explained and confirmed by their verbal confession. &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; is never an adverb of time signifying "then;" neither in <a href="/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>, nor <a href="/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>. "And thus Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpeh." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; does not mean "he became judge" (Mich. and others), any more than "he punished every one according to his iniquity" (Thenius, after David Kimchi). Judging the people neither consisted in a censure pronounced by Samuel afterwards, nor in absolution granted to the penitent after they had made a confession of their sin, but in the fact that Samuel summoned the nation to Mizpeh to humble itself before Jehovah, and there secured for it, through his intercession, the forgiveness of its sin, and a renewal of the favour of its God, and thus restored the proper relation between Israel and its God, so that the Lord could proceed to vindicate His people's rights against their foes.<p>When the Philistines heard of the gathering of the Israelites at Mizpeh (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/7-8.htm">1 Samuel 7:8</a>), their princes went up against Israel to make war upon it; and the Israelites, in their fear of the Philistines, entreated Samuel, "Do not cease to cry for us to the Lord our God, that He may save us out of the hand of the Philistines." <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>. "And Samuel took a milk-lamb (a lamb that was still sucking, probably, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/22-27.htm">Leviticus 22:27</a>, a lamb seven days old), and offered it whole as a burnt-offering to the Lord." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is used adverbially, according to its original meaning as an adverb, "whole." The Chaldee has not given the word at all, probably because the translators regarded it as pleonastic, since every burnt-offering was consumed upon the altar whole, and consequently the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; was sometimes used in a substantive sense, as synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/51-21.htm">Psalm 51:21</a>). But in the passage before us, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; is not synonymous with &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, but simply affirms that the lamb was offered upon the altar without being cut up or divided. Samuel selected a young lamb for the burnt-offering, not "as being the purest and most innocent kind of sacrificial animal," - for it cannot possibly be shown that very young animals were regarded as purer than those that were full-grown, - but as being the most suitable to represent the nation that had wakened up to new life through its conversion to the Lord, and was, as it were, new-born. For the burnt-offering represented the man, who consecrated therein his life and labour to the Lord. The sacrifice was the substratum for prayer. When Samuel offered it, he cried to the Lord for the children of Israel; and the Lord "answered," i.e., granted, his prayer.</body></html>
