The sudden destruction of the Phœnician idol shrines throughout the country, followed immediately by the summons of a vast popular assembly, held in so conspicuous a place as Mizpeh in Benjamin aroused at once the warlike nation which had so long kept Israel in servitude.

When sinners begin to repent and reform, they must expect that Satan will muster all his force against them, and set his instruments at work to the utmost, to oppose and discourage them. The Israelites earnestly beg Samuel to pray for them. Oh what a comfort it is to all believers, that our great Intercessor above never ceases, is never silent! for he always appears in the presence of God for us. Samuel's sacrifice, without his prayer, had been an empty shadow. God gave a gracious answer. And Samuel erected a memorial of this victory, to the glory of God, and to encourage Israel. Through successive generations, the church of God has had cause to set up Eben-ezers for renewed deliverances; neither outward persecutions nor inward corruptions have prevailed against her, because hitherto the Lord hath helped her: and he will help, even to the end of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This implies a united invasion by the whole Philistine force.

While Samuel Prays, the Philistines Are Discomfited.<p>7-11. when the Philistines heard, &c.&#8212;The character and importance of the national convention at Mizpeh were fully appreciated by the Philistines. They discerned in it the rising spirit of religious patriotism among the Israelites that was prepared to throw off the yoke of their domination. Anxious to crush it at the first, they made a sudden incursion while the Israelites were in the midst of their solemn celebration. Unprepared for resistance, they besought Samuel to supplicate the divine interposition to save them from their enemies. The prophet's prayers and sacrifice were answered by such a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning that the assailants, panic-struck, were disordered and fled. The Israelites, recognizing the hand of God, rushed courageously on the foe they had so much dreaded and committed such immense havoc, that the Philistines did not for long recover from this disastrous blow. This brilliant victory secured peace and independence to Israel for twenty years, as well as the restitution of the usurped territory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The lords of the Philistines went up, </span> to wit, with all army, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm" title="And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.">1 Samuel 7:10</a></span>, suspecting the effects of their general convention, and intending to nip them in the bud. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They were afraid; </span> being a company of unarmed persons, and unfit for battle. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh,....

No dominant nation would permit a subject race to hold such a meeting as Samuel's at Mizpah without having recourse to arms; but the Philistines acted with such promptness and vigour as brought home to the assembled Israelites not merely the conviction that they would have to fight, but that they must do it at once, and with the combined forces of the enemy. In spite, nevertheless, of their fears, they determine to await the attack, and that this decision was taken in faith their own words prove. For they say, <span class="cmt_word">Cease not to cry unto Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> The words literally are, "Be not silent from crying," etc. Let him mediate for them with God, and they will await the onslaught of the foe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim complied with this request, and brought the ark into the house of Abinadab upon the height, and sanctified Abinadab's son Eleazar to be the keeper of the ark. Kirjath-jearim, the present Kuryet el Enab (see at <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), was neither a priestly nor a Levitical city. The reason why the ark was taken there, is to be sought for, therefore, in the situation of the town, i.e., in the fact that Kirjath-jearim was the nearest large town on the road from Bethshemesh to Shiloh. We have no definite information, however, as to the reason why it was not taken on to Shiloh, to be placed in the tabernacle, but was allowed to remain in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, where a keeper was expressly appointed to take charge of it; so that we can only confine ourselves to conjectures. Ewald's opinion (Gesch. ii. 540), that the Philistines had conquered Shiloh after the victory described in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>, and had destroyed the ancient sanctuary there, i.e., the tabernacle, is at variance with the accounts given in <a href="/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, respecting the continuance of worship in the tabernacle at Nob and Gibeon. There is much more to be said in support of the conjecture, that the carrying away of the ark by the Philistines was regarded as a judgment upon the sanctuary, which had been desecrated by the reckless conduct of the sons of Eli, and consequently, that even when the ark itself was recovered, they would not take it back without an express declaration of the will of God, but were satisfied, as a temporary arrangement, to leave the ark in Kirjath-jearim, which was farther removed from the cities of the Philistines. And there it remained, because no declaration of the divine will followed respecting its removal into the tabernacle, and the tabernacle itself had to be removed from Shiloh to Nob, and eventually to Gibeon, until David had effected the conquest of the citadel of Zion, and chosen Jerusalem as his capital, when it was removed from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>). It is not stated that Abinadab was a Levites; but this is very probable, because otherwise they would hardly have consecrated his son to be the keeper of the ark, but would have chosen a Levite for the office. </body></html>
