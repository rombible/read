Those that submit to the government of the world and the flesh, are told plainly, what hard masters they are, and what tyranny the dominion of sin is. The law of God and the manner of men widely differ from each other; the former should be our rule in the several relations of life; the latter should be the measure of our expectations from others. These would be their grievances, and, when they complained to God, he would not hear them. When we bring ourselves into distress by our own wrong desires and projects, we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer, and the benefit of Divine aid. The people were obstinate and urgent in their demand. Sudden resolves and hasty desires make work for long and leisurely repentance. Our wisdom is, to be thankful for the advantages, and patient under the disadvantages of the government we may live under; and to pray continually for our rulers, that they may govern us in the fear of God, and that we may live under them in all godliness and honesty. And it is a hopeful symptom when our desires of worldly objects can brook delay; and when we can refer the time and manner of their being granted to God's providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin which implies that the thing spoken of caused anger, indignation, or some revulsion of feeling (see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm">Genesis 21:11-12</a>). The answer of the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a> shows that Samuel's personal feelings had been hurt. They were soothed by being reminded of the continued ingratitude of the people to God Himself, upon whom, in fact, a greater slight was put by this very request for a king "like all the nations," than upon Samuel (compare <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>). For a comment on this transaction, see <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-9.htm">Hosea 13:9-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-10. the thing displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to judge us&#8212;Personal and family feelings might affect his views of this public movement. But his dissatisfaction arose principally from the proposed change being revolutionary in its character. Though it would not entirely subvert their theocratic government, the appointment of a visible monarch would necessarily tend to throw out of view their unseen King and Head. God intimated, through Samuel, that their request would, in anger, be granted, while at the same time he apprised them of some of the evils that would result from their choice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto them,.... How he considered this request of theirs as a rejection of him as their king, and that it was acting the same ungrateful part they had always done; and since they were so importunate to have it granted, it should be done; but that he was ordered to lay before them all the inconveniences that would attend it, and the evils that would follow upon it unto them: <p>that asked of him a king; which is observed, not to distinguish a part of them from the rest; for this was an united request of the people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>10â€“18.

This request resembles so completely the law of the king in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a> (observe, for example, the expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;), that the distinct allusion to it is unmistakeable. The custom of expressly quoting the book of the law is met with for the first time in the writings of the period of the captivity. The elders simply desired what Jehovah had foretold through His servant Moses, as a thing that would take place in the future and for which He had even made provision. </body></html>
