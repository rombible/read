The Deuteronomy directions contained in <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-14.htm" title="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.">1Samuel 17:14-20</a> are clear and explicit in this matter of an earthly king for the people, and Moses evidently had looked forward to this alteration in the constitution when he framed the Law. No date for the change is specified, but from the terms of the Deuteronomy words no distant period evidently was looked on to. Then, again, though Samuel was naturally displeased, he at once, as prophet and seer, carried the matter to the God-Friend of Israel in prayer, and the Eternal King at once bids His old true servant to comply with the people’s desire.<p>The displeasure of the prophet-judge was very natural. He felt—this we see from the comforting words his Master addressed to him (see <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.">1Samuel 8:7</a>)—that the people, notwithstanding the vast claims he possessed to their gratitude, craved another and a different ruler, and were dissatisfied with his government. Samuel too was conscious that Israel by its request declined the direct sovereignty of the Eternal. The change to an earthly sovereign had been foreseen, foretold, even arranged for, by Moses, but, in spite of all this, to one like Samuel it was very bitter. It seemed to remove the people from that solitary platform which they alone among nations had been allowed to occupy. They had found by sad experience, as Moses,—“their Rabbi,” as the old teachers loved to style him—had predicted, that such a form of government was, alas! unsuited to them, and that they must descend <span class= "ital">here </span>to the level of ordinary peoples. But though all this was undisputably true, it was very bitter for the hero patriot to give up for ever the splendid Hebrew ideal that his people were the subjects of the Eternal King, ruled directly by Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/8-6.htm" title="But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us.

It drove him to his knees. When any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to show our trouble before God. Samuel is to tell them that they shall have a king. Not that God was pleased with their request, but as sometimes he opposes us from loving-kindness, so at other times he gratifies us in wrath; he did so here.

The answer of the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a> shows that Samuel's personal feelings had been hurt. They were soothed by being reminded of the continued ingratitude of the people to God Himself, upon whom, in fact, a greater slight was put by this very request for a king "like all the nations," than upon Samuel (compare <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).

But his dissatisfaction arose principally from the proposed change being revolutionary in its character. Though it would not entirely subvert their theocratic government, the appointment of a visible monarch would necessarily tend to throw out of view their unseen King and Head. God intimated, through Samuel, that their request would, in anger, be granted, while at the same time he apprised them of some of the evils that would result from their choice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The thing displeased Samuel; not their complaint of his sons, but their desire of a king, as is apparent from the following words, and from the whole course of the story; which was so grievous to him, partly because of their injustice and ingratitude to himself, whose government, though it had been so sweet and beneficial to them, they plainly show themselves weary of; and principally because God was hereby dishonoured and provoked, by that distrust of God, and that vain-glory and ambition, and that itch after changes, which were the manifest causes of this desire; and because of that great servitude and misery which he wisely foresaw the people would hereby bring upon themselves, as he particularly informs them, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1 Samuel 8:11</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Samuel prayed unto the Lord, </span> for the pardon of their sin, and desire of direction and help from God in this great affair. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the thing displeased Samuel,....

God’s answer, “Not thee (their judge) have they rejected, but me (their true king) have they rejected from reigning over them” (the Heb. order is emphatic) at once consoles him and points out the real sinfulness of the request. This consisted not in the mere desire for a king, which would not necessarily have been wrong, but in the spirit of distrust of the invisible sovereignty of Jehovah and desire for the splendour of a visible monarch which really prompted the request.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Samuel prayed</span>] He does not let his own personal feelings decide, but endeavours to learn what is the Will of God in the matter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the thing displeased Samuel, and justly so.</span> For, in the first place, they had determined to have a king without consulting the will of God. Granting that it would give them the security necessary for the nation's welfare and progress, yet so weighty a matter ought not to have been decided without an appeal to Jehovah. Samuel did make it a matter of prayer; the elders were actuated solely by political motives. And, secondly, they undervalued their own religious privileges. They wanted a king such as the heathen had, whereas something far better and higher was possible for them, namely, a king who would be the representative of Jehovah, as the shophet had hitherto been. The nation's real need was not a new power, but the permanent organisation of what up to this time had been a casual authority. And it was Samuel's high office to give the nation this, while he also changed the outward form of prophecy, and made it too into an orderly institution. <span class="cmt_word">A king to judge us.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to govern us, as the shophet or, judge had done, only in a more regularly constituted manner. <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.</span> There had been no such submission to the will of God on the part of the elders; but deeply as Samuel must have been hurt by this determination of the nation to take the government out of the hands of himself and his sons, yet he leaves the decision to Jehovah. Moreover, we must note that it was as prophet that he thus acted as mediator between the people and God; and he gave them his services in this his highest capacity as faithfully when the question was one injurious to himself as he had ever done on more pleasing occasions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel's judicial labours. - With the calling of the people to Mizpeh, and the victory at Ebenezer that had been obtained through his prayer, Samuel had assumed the government of the whole nation; so that his office as judge dates from his period, although he had laboured as prophet among the people from the death of Eli, and had thereby prepared the way for the conversion of Israel to the Lord. As his prophetic labours were described in general terms in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19-21</a>, so are his labours as judge in the verses before us: viz., in <a href="/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a> their duration, - "all the days of his life," as his activity during Saul's reign and the anointing of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15-16</a>) sufficiently prove; and then in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-16.htm">1 Samuel 3:16</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a> their general character, - "he went round from year to year" (&#1493;&#1505;&#1489;&#1489; serves as a more precise definition of &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, he went and travelled round) to Bethel, i.e., Beitin (see at <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>), Gilgal, and Mizpeh (see at. <a href="/1_samuel/3-5.htm">1 Samuel 3:5</a>), and judged Israel at all these places. Which Gilgal is meant, whether the one situated in the valley of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>), or the Jiljilia on the higher ground to the south-west of Shiloh (see at <a href="/joshua/8-35.htm">Joshua 8:35</a>), cannot be determined with perfect certainty. The latter is favoured partly by the order in which the three places visited by Samuel on his circuits occur, since according to this he probably went first of all from Ramah to Bethel, which was to the north-east, then farther north or north-west to Jiljilia, and then turning back went towards the south-east to Mizpeh, and returning thence to Ramah performed a complete circuit; whereas, if the Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan had been the place referred to, we should expect him to go there first of all from Ramah, and then towards the north-east to Bethel, and from that to the south-west to Mizpeh; and partly also by the circumstance that, according to <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>, there was a school of the prophets at Jiljilia in the time of Elijah and Elisha, the founding of which probably dated as far back as the days of Samuel. If this conjecture were really a well-founded one, it would furnish a strong proof that it was in this place, and not in the Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan, that Samuel judged the people. But as this conjecture cannot be raised into a certainty, the evidence in favour of Jiljilia is not so conclusive as I myself formerly supposed (see also the remarks on <a href="/1_samuel/9-14.htm">1 Samuel 9:14</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1514; is grammatically considered an accusative, and is in apposition to &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, lit., Israel, viz., all the places named, i.e., Israel which inhabited all these places, and was to be found there. "And this return was to Ramah;" i.e., after finishing the annual circuit he returned to Ramah, where he had his house. There he judged Israel, and also built an altar to conduct the religious affairs of the nation. Up to the death of Eli, Samuel lived and laboured at Shiloh (<a href="/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>). But when the ark was carried away by the Philistines, and consequently the tabernacle at Shiloh lost what was most essential to it as a sanctuary, and ceased at once to be the scene of the gracious presence of God, Samuel went to his native town Ramah, and there built an altar as the place of sacrifice for Jehovah, who had manifested himself to him. The building of the altar at Ramah would naturally be suggested to the prophet by these extraordinary circumstances, even if it had not been expressly commanded by Jehovah. </body></html>
