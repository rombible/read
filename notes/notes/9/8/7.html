Take courage, they seem to say, “my old true servant, and be not dismayed at this apparently bitter proof of the ingratitude of the people you loved so well. This deliberate complaint on the part of Israel is directed not against you, the judge, but against Me, the invisible King. They have ever been the same—incapable of becoming my true subjects, and of winning on earth the lofty position I would have given them; you must give them now their hearts’ desire. It has all been foreseen and provided for; only make them understand <span class= "ital">what </span>they are asking. Then give them their earthly king.” <span class= "ital">Very sad, </span>for it was the deliberate abandonment by the Eternal God of His first intention as regarded Israel—the deliberate lowering of the grand ideal once formed for His chosen people. Here, as is not unfrequent in the Divine records, we have a corner of the veil which hangs between the creature and the Creator lifted for a moment. We see how sadly possible it is for man in the exercise of his perfect freewill to mar the glorious work arranged for him by his God. We see too in the records of such a transaction as this (see <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>) how all was foreseen by the King of heaven, and we catch sight of the sorrowful regret—if we may use the term—of the Creator for the perverse folly of His creatures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.">1 Samuel 8:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord said, Hearken unto the people, </span>&c. — He grants their desire in anger, for their punishment. For these, it is plain, are the words of displeasure, being as much as to say, Let them have their will. Samuel took it very ill that they should be dissatisfied with his government: but God tells him that he himself had more reason to be angry. For, in truth, they had thrown off his authority who was their king, as Samuel tells them afterward, <a href="/1_samuel/12-12.htm" title="And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.">1 Samuel 12:12</a>; and who had governed them by judges, whom he raised up and extraordinarily inspired when he saw occasion; as he had before conducted them by Moses and Joshua, who never ordained any thing of moment without a special command from God. <span class="ital">They have not rejected thee — </span>Merely or chiefly. <span class="ital">They have rejected me </span>— This injury and contumely reflects chiefly upon me and my government. <span class="ital">Should not reign — </span>By my immediate government, which was the great honour, safety, and happiness of this people, if they had had hearts to prize it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:4-9 Samuel was displeased; he could patiently bear what reflected on himself, and his own family; but it displeased him when they said, Give us a king to judge us, because that reflected upon God. It drove him to his knees. When any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to show our trouble before God. Samuel is to tell them that they shall have a king. Not that God was pleased with their request, but as sometimes he opposes us from loving-kindness, so at other times he gratifies us in wrath; he did so here. God knows how to bring glory to himself, and serves his own wise purposes, even by men's foolish counsels.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin which implies that the thing spoken of caused anger, indignation, or some revulsion of feeling (see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm">Genesis 21:11-12</a>). The answer of the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a> shows that Samuel's personal feelings had been hurt. They were soothed by being reminded of the continued ingratitude of the people to God Himself, upon whom, in fact, a greater slight was put by this very request for a king "like all the nations," than upon Samuel (compare <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).

But his dissatisfaction arose principally from the proposed change being revolutionary in its character. Though it would not entirely subvert their theocratic government, the appointment of a visible monarch would necessarily tend to throw out of view their unseen King and Head. God intimated, through Samuel, that their request would, in anger, be granted, while at the same time he apprised them of some of the evils that would result from their choice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hearken unto the voice of the people; </span> God grants their desire in anger, and for their punishment, as is affirmed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/hosea/13-11.htm" title="I gave you a king in my anger, and took him away in my wrath.">Hosea 13:11</a></span>.

The inference which we might draw from this alone, namely, that they were simply to support their father in the administration of justice, and that Samuel had no intention of laying down his office, and still less of making the supreme office of judge hereditary in his family, is still more apparent from the fact that they were stationed as judges of the nation in Beersheba, which was on the southern border of Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, etc.; see at <a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>).
