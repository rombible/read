Were they willing to exchange their Republican freedom for the condition of subjection to a sovereign who, after the manner of those other kings of foreign nations—the Pharaohs, for instance—would of course govern Israel after his own will? in other words, were they really willing to give up their Republic for a Despotism?<p>In this whole transaction of the appointment of an earthly king in Israel, we must not forget that although under the present circumstances of Israel it was the <span class= "ital">best </span>course to pursue, and, as such, received the Divine sanction, yet it was giving up the old grand ideal of a nation dwelling on earth ruled over directly by a King whose throne and home were in the eternal heavens. The glorious hope had to be given up, because Israel had been tried and found unworthy to share in the undreamed-of blessings of such a Government.<p><span class= "bld">He will take your sons.</span>—Here follows a graphic picture of the changed life of the people under a despotic monarch. They must be prepared, must those elders, for a court—a gorgeous court such as they had heard of, and perhaps some of them had seen on the banks of the Nile, the Euphrates, or the Tigris; all that was best and choicest in Israel would be summoned there. The old pastoral life would disappear; the dwelling under their own vines and fig-trees would give place to a very different way of living; the pleasures and vices of a gay and brilliant city life would allure the sons and daughters. and tempt them from the old simple way of living, dear to so many in Israel. War, too, on a scale they hitherto had never dreamed of, would be their portion—all these heavy burdens would become the heritage of Israel if they chose to imitate in their government the nations of the world.

Those that submit to the government of the world and the flesh, are told plainly, what hard masters they are, and what tyranny the dominion of sin is. The law of God and the manner of men widely differ from each other; the former should be our rule in the several relations of life; the latter should be the measure of our expectations from others. These would be their grievances, and, when they complained to God, he would not hear them. When we bring ourselves into distress by our own wrong desires and projects, we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer, and the benefit of Divine aid. The people were obstinate and urgent in their demand. Sudden resolves and hasty desires make work for long and leisurely repentance. Our wisdom is, to be thankful for the advantages, and patient under the disadvantages of the government we may live under; and to pray continually for our rulers, that they may govern us in the fear of God, and that we may live under them in all godliness and honesty. And it is a hopeful symptom when our desires of worldly objects can brook delay; and when we can refer the time and manner of their being granted to God's providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin which implies that the thing spoken of caused anger, indignation, or some revulsion of feeling (see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm">Genesis 21:11-12</a>). The answer of the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a> shows that Samuel's personal feelings had been hurt. They were soothed by being reminded of the continued ingratitude of the people to God Himself, upon whom, in fact, a greater slight was put by this very request for a king "like all the nations," than upon Samuel (compare <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18</a>, <a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).

Not in which he ought to proceed, but what he will do: and this not the manner of one king, or of the first only, but of all of them, more or less; of kings in general, who are commonly inclined to arbitrary power. So Aristotle (a) in opposition to theocracy, describes a full and absolute kingdom, as he calls it, when a king does all things according to his will: and observes, that he that would have the mind or reason preside, would have God and the laws rule; but he that would have a man to reign, adds also a lust, or one led by his own lust: so it follows: <p>he will take your sons, and appoint them for himself; for his own use and service, to wait upon him, to be his pages, or grooms, or guards: <p>for his chariots; to take care of them, and drive them, though not without paying them for it; yet this being but a mean and servile employment, and what they should be obliged to, whether they would or no, is observed to show the tyranny and bondage to which they would be subject, when their sons otherwise might be free men, and possessed of estates and carriages of their own: <p>and to be his horsemen; or rather "for his horses", to take care of them, and go out along with him, and attend his person, whether when going to war, or on pleasure: <p>and some shall run before his chariots; be his running footmen, being swift of foot, and trained up for that service; some are naturally swift, as Asahel was <a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>. Pliny (b) speaks of some swifter than horses; and of the swiftness of some he elsewhere gives (c) many surprising instances. It seems as if it was usual to have fifty such men to run before them, see <a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>. <p>(a) In Politicis, l. 3. c. 16. (b) Nat.

Under such a despotism political and social freedom is at an end. Prosperous as was Solomon’s reign, it tended in this direction.

Instead of the old simplicity in which the judges had lived, he would have a state chariot (see <a href="/2_kings/9-21.htm">2 Kings 9:21</a>), and go forth escorted by horsemen and runners on foot. <span class="cmt_word">To be his horsemen.</span> Rather, "upon his homes."

This request resembles so completely the law of the king in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a> (observe, for example, the expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;), that the distinct allusion to it is unmistakeable. The custom of expressly quoting the book of the law is met with for the first time in the writings of the period of the captivity. The elders simply desired what Jehovah had foretold through His servant Moses, as a thing that would take place in the future and for which He had even made provision. </body></html>
