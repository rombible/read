In other words, “Ye elders and chiefs of the people must make up your minds, in the event of electing a king, to the loss of all political and social freedom.” How bitterly the nation, even in the successful and glorious reign of King Solomon, felt the pressure of the royal yoke, so truly foretold by their last judge, is shown in the history of the times which followed the death of Solomon, when the public discontent at the brilliant but despotic rule of the great king led to the revolution which split up the people into two nations. (See <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm" title="Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.">1Kings 12:4</a>.) “This whole passage bears internal evidence of having been written before the establishment of the monarchy.”—<span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:10-22 If they would have a king to rule them, as the eastern kings ruled their subjects, they would find the yoke exceedingly heavy. Those that submit to the government of the world and the flesh, are told plainly, what hard masters they are, and what tyranny the dominion of sin is. The law of God and the manner of men widely differ from each other; the former should be our rule in the several relations of life; the latter should be the measure of our expectations from others. These would be their grievances, and, when they complained to God, he would not hear them. When we bring ourselves into distress by our own wrong desires and projects, we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer, and the benefit of Divine aid. The people were obstinate and urgent in their demand. Sudden resolves and hasty desires make work for long and leisurely repentance. Our wisdom is, to be thankful for the advantages, and patient under the disadvantages of the government we may live under; and to pray continually for our rulers, that they may govern us in the fear of God, and that we may live under them in all godliness and honesty. And it is a hopeful symptom when our desires of worldly objects can brook delay; and when we can refer the time and manner of their being granted to God's providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See illustrations in marginal references; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-18. he will take your fields, &c.&#8212;The circumstances mentioned here might be illustrated by exact analogies in the conduct of many Oriental monarchs in the present day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. He shall use you like slaves, and deprive you of that liberty which you now enjoy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He will take the tenth of your sheep,....
