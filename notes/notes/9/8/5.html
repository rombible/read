They felt that the cares and duties of government were too weighty for Samuel, now growing old; and the men who through their kinship to him would naturally succeed him were utterly unfit for his office. The prospect before them was, they felt, a gloomy one. The Philistine power, too, was becoming daily greater in the south.<p>But what confidence must this assembly of elders have reposed in their aged judge to have used such a plea—his own growing infirmity and the unworthiness of his own sons, whom he had himself appointed to high offices!

Not that God was pleased with their request, but as sometimes he opposes us from loving-kindness, so at other times he gratifies us in wrath; he did so here.

Unable, from growing infirmities, to prosecute his circuit journeys through the country, he at length confined his magisterial duties to Ramah and its neighborhood (1Sa 7:15), delegating to his sons as his deputies the administration of justice in the southern districts of Palestine, their provincial court being held at Beer-sheba. The young men, however, did not inherit the high qualities of their father. Having corrupted the fountains of justice for their own private aggrandizement, a deputation of the leading men in the country lodged a complaint against them in headquarters, accompanied with a formal demand for a change in the government. The limited and occasional authority of the judges, the disunion and jealousy of the tribes under the administration of those rulers, had been creating a desire for a united and permanent form of government; while the advanced age of Samuel, together with the risk of his death happening in the then unsettled state of the people, was the occasion of calling forth an expression of this desire now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They feared that Samuel would not live long; and that either he through infirmity and indulgence might leave the government in his sons’ hands, or that they would invade and keep it after their father’s death; and therefore they jointly make their complaints against them, and procure their removal from their places. Thus they are brought low, and crushed by those very wicked ways by which they desired to advance and establish themselves. So true is it, that honesty is the best policy, and unrighteousness the greatest folly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Make us a king to judge us:</span> their conclusion outruns their premises, and their desires exceed their reasons or arguments, which extended no further than to the removal of Samuel’s sons from their places, and the procuring some other just and prudent assistance to Samuel’s age.

See <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-1.htm">1 Samuel 8:1</a>, his age was no reproach to him, nor was it becoming them to upbraid him with it; nor was it a reason why he should be removed from his office, for it did not disqualify him for it; but rather, having gained by age experience, was more fit for it, though he might not be able to ride his circuits as formerly: <p>and thy sons walk not in thy ways; whom he had made judges; this is a better reason than the former for what is after requested; and had they only besought them to remove him from their places, and rested content with that, it would have been well enough; but what they were solicitous for, and always had an inclination to, and now thought a proper opportunity offered of obtaining it, was what follows: <p>now make us a king to judge us like all the nations; to rule over them as sole monarch; to go before them in battle as their general, as well as to administer justice to them, by hearing and trying causes as their judge; which only they mention to cover their views, and make their motion more acceptable to Samuel; what they were desirous of was to have a king appearing in pomp and splendour, wearing a crown of gold, clothed in royal apparel, with a sceptre in his hand, dwelling in a stately palace, keeping a splendid court, and attended with a grand retinue, as the rest of the nations about them had had for a long time. The first kings we read of were in the times of Abraham, but after it became common for nations to have kings over them, and particularly the neighbours of Israel, as Edom, Moab, Ammon, &amp;c. and Cicero says (x), all the ancient nations had their kings, to whom they were obedient: Israel had God for their King in a peculiar manner other nations had not, and stood in no need of any other; and happy it would have been for them if they had been content therewith, and not sought after another: however, they were so modest, and paid such deference to Samuel, as to desire him to make or appoint one for them. <p>(x) De Legibus, l. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">make us a king</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">set</span>, i.e. <span class="bld">appoint</span>, the same word as in the corresponding passage, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm" title="When you are come to the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">like all the nations</span>] i.e. as all the surrounding nations have kings.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel's judicial labours. - With the calling of the people to Mizpeh, and the victory at Ebenezer that had been obtained through his prayer, Samuel had assumed the government of the whole nation; so that his office as judge dates from his period, although he had laboured as prophet among the people from the death of Eli, and had thereby prepared the way for the conversion of Israel to the Lord. As his prophetic labours were described in general terms in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19-21</a>, so are his labours as judge in the verses before us: viz., in <a href="/1_samuel/3-15.htm">1 Samuel 3:15</a> their duration, - "all the days of his life," as his activity during Saul's reign and the anointing of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15-16</a>) sufficiently prove; and then in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-16.htm">1 Samuel 3:16</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a> their general character, - "he went round from year to year" (&#1493;&#1505;&#1489;&#1489; serves as a more precise definition of &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;, he went and travelled round) to Bethel, i.e., Beitin (see at <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>), Gilgal, and Mizpeh (see at. <a href="/1_samuel/3-5.htm">1 Samuel 3:5</a>), and judged Israel at all these places. Which Gilgal is meant, whether the one situated in the valley of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>), or the Jiljilia on the higher ground to the south-west of Shiloh (see at <a href="/joshua/8-35.htm">Joshua 8:35</a>), cannot be determined with perfect certainty. The latter is favoured partly by the order in which the three places visited by Samuel on his circuits occur, since according to this he probably went first of all from Ramah to Bethel, which was to the north-east, then farther north or north-west to Jiljilia, and then turning back went towards the south-east to Mizpeh, and returning thence to Ramah performed a complete circuit; whereas, if the Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan had been the place referred to, we should expect him to go there first of all from Ramah, and then towards the north-east to Bethel, and from that to the south-west to Mizpeh; and partly also by the circumstance that, according to <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>, there was a school of the prophets at Jiljilia in the time of Elijah and Elisha, the founding of which probably dated as far back as the days of Samuel. If this conjecture were really a well-founded one, it would furnish a strong proof that it was in this place, and not in the Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan, that Samuel judged the people. But as this conjecture cannot be raised into a certainty, the evidence in favour of Jiljilia is not so conclusive as I myself formerly supposed (see also the remarks on <a href="/1_samuel/9-14.htm">1 Samuel 9:14</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1514; is grammatically considered an accusative, and is in apposition to &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, lit., Israel, viz., all the places named, i.e., Israel which inhabited all these places, and was to be found there. "And this return was to Ramah;" i.e., after finishing the annual circuit he returned to Ramah, where he had his house. There he judged Israel, and also built an altar to conduct the religious affairs of the nation. Up to the death of Eli, Samuel lived and laboured at Shiloh (<a href="/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>). But when the ark was carried away by the Philistines, and consequently the tabernacle at Shiloh lost what was most essential to it as a sanctuary, and ceased at once to be the scene of the gracious presence of God, Samuel went to his native town Ramah, and there built an altar as the place of sacrifice for Jehovah, who had manifested himself to him. The building of the altar at Ramah would naturally be suggested to the prophet by these extraordinary circumstances, even if it had not been expressly commanded by Jehovah. </body></html>
