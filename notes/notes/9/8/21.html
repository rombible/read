Those that submit to the government of the world and the flesh, are told plainly, what hard masters they are, and what tyranny the dominion of sin is. The law of God and the manner of men widely differ from each other; the former should be our rule in the several relations of life; the latter should be the measure of our expectations from others. These would be their grievances, and, when they complained to God, he would not hear them. When we bring ourselves into distress by our own wrong desires and projects, we justly forfeit the comfort of prayer, and the benefit of Divine aid. The people were obstinate and urgent in their demand. Sudden resolves and hasty desires make work for long and leisurely repentance. Our wisdom is, to be thankful for the advantages, and patient under the disadvantages of the government we may live under; and to pray continually for our rulers, that they may govern us in the fear of God, and that we may live under them in all godliness and honesty. And it is a hopeful symptom when our desires of worldly objects can brook delay; and when we can refer the time and manner of their being granted to God's providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fight our battles - It appears from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>, that the warlike movements of Nahash had already begun to excite alarm. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19-22. Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel&#8212;They sneered at Samuel's description as a bugbear to frighten them. Determined, at all hazards, to gain their object, they insisted on being made like all the other nations, though it was their glory and happiness to be unlike other nations in having the Lord for their King and Lawgiver (Nu 23:9; De 33:28). Their demand was conceded, for the government of a king had been provided for in the law; and they were dismissed to wait the appointment, which God had reserved to Himself (De 17:14-20).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He repeated them privately between God and himself; partly for his own vindication and comfort; and partly as a foundation for his prayers to God, for direction and assistance in this difficult case. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Samuel heard all the words of the people,....
