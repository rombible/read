For this act the Edomite servant of Saul has been execrated in the most ancient Jewish writings perhaps above any other of the famous wicked men who meet us in the Holy Scriptures. For instance, we read in the Babylonian Talmud how “Doeg the Edomite, after his massacre of the priests, was encountered by three destructive demons. One deprived him of his learning (concerning which see above, in Note on <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm" title="Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.">1Samuel 22:9</a>), a second burned his soul, and a third scattered his dust in the synagogues”—Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 106, Colossians 2. The Babylonian Talmud has a still more curious comment on the iniquity of Doeg, in which David is bitterly reproached by the Most High for being the cause of Doeg’s great sin and its terrible consequences. “Rav Yehudah recorded that Rav had said . . . The Holy One, blessed be He! had said to David, How long shall this iniquity cling to thee? Through thee the priests of Nob were slain; through thee Doeg the Edomite became a reprobate; and through thee Saul and his three sons were slain.”—Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 95, cols. 1, 2.<p><span class= "bld">A linen ephod.</span>—The ordinary priests appear to have worn a linen over garment, similar in form to the high priestly cape or ephod. They came probably from Nob to Gibeah (the distance was not great) clad in their official costume, out of respect to the king who sent for them. The murderous deed assumes a still more awful character when we recollect who were the victims—the priests of the living God, clad in their white ministering robes!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm" title="And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests.

Saul looks upon all about him as his enemies, because they do not just say as he says. In Ahimelech's answer to Saul we have the language of conscious innocence. But what wickedness will not the evil spirit hurry men to when he gets the dominion! Saul alleges that which was utterly false and unproved. But the most bloody tyrants have found instruments of their cruelty as barbarous as themselves. Doeg, having murdered the priests, went to the city, Nob, and put all to the sword there. Nothing so vile but those may do it, who have provoked God to give them up to their hearts' lusts. Yet this was the accomplishment of the threatenings against the house of Eli. Though Saul was unrighteous in doing this, yet God was righteous in permitting it.

He had a band of men under his command, many or all of whom were perhaps foreigners like himself, and very likely of a Bedouin caste, to whom bloodshed would be quite natural, and the priests of the Lord of no more account than so Early sheep or oxen. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 22:17-19.

But they chose rather to disobey the king than to offend God by imbruing their hands in the blood of his ministering servants.

To Saul's appeal, "Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, by giving him bread?" Ahimelech, who was not conscious of any such crime, since David had come to him with a false pretext, and the priest had probably but very little knowledge of what took place at court, replied both calmly and worthily (<a href="/1_samuel/22-14.htm">1 Samuel 22:14</a>): "And who of all thy servants is so faithful (proved, attested, as in <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) as David, and son-in-law of the king, and having access to thy private audience, and honoured in thy house?" The true explanation of &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; &#1505;&#1512; may be gathered from a comparison of <a href="/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-25.htm">1 Chronicles 11:25</a>, where &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514; occurs again, as the context clearly shows, in the sense of a privy councillor of the king, who hears his personal revelations and converses with him about them, so that it corresponds to our "audience." &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, lit. to turn aside from the way, to go in to any one, or to look after anything (<a href="/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>, etc.); hence in the passage before us "to have access," to be attached to a person. This is the explanation given by Gesenius and most of the modern expositors, whereas the early translators entirely misunderstood the passage, though they have given the meaning correctly enough at <a href="/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a>. But if this was the relation in which David stood to Saul, - and he had really done so for a long time, - there was nothing wrong in what the high priest had done for him; but he had acted according to the best of his knowledge, and quite conscientiously as a faithful subject of the king. Ahimelech then added still further (<a href="/1_samuel/22-15.htm">1 Samuel 22:15</a>): "Did I then begin to inquire of God for him this day?" i.e., was it the first time that I had obtained the decision of God for David concerning important enterprises, which he had to carry out in the service of the king? "Far be from me," sc., any conspiracy against the king, like that of which I am accused. "Let not the king lay it as a burden upon thy servant, my whole father's house (the omission of the cop. &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; may be accounted for from the excitement of the speaker); for thy servant knows not the least of all this." &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, of all that Saul had charged him with. </body></html>
