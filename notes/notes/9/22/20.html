It has been suggested that when his father and the whole body of priests went to Gibeah, in accordance with the summons of King Saul, Abiathar remained behind to perform the necessary functions in the sanctuary, and when he heard of the death of his father and his brother priests, he made his escape, and eventually joined David. The exact period of his coming to the exiled band under David is uncertain; in many of the recitals in this Book no note of time is given. It is, therefore, probable that the meeting and interview with David—related in <a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm" title="And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.">1Samuel 22:20</a> and following verses—did not take place immediately after the massacre at Gibeah, nor even directly after the destruction of Nob. From the statement in <a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm" title="When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul stayed in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)">1Samuel 22:6</a> of 1 Samuel 23, it would appear that Abiathar only joined David at Keilah. From that time, however, Abiathar, who became after his father’s death high priest, occupies an important place in the story of David’s life. Throughout his reign he continued his faithful friend, and seems to have been a worthy holder of his important office. The close of his life, however, was a melancholy one. In the troubles which arose about the succession, in the last days of David’s reign, he espoused the side of Adonijah, and was in consequence deposed by the successful Solomon from the high priesthood, and sent into banishment to Anathoth. (See <a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm" title="And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.">1Kings 2:26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm" title="And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.">1 Samuel 22:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">Abiathar escaped and fled after David </span>— He, by his father’s death, was now high-priest, and is the person referred to <a href="/mark/2-26.htm" title="How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?">Mark 2:26</a>, where we find him described by an office which he did not bear till after the event alluded to, Ahimelech, as we have seen, being high-priest when David took the show-bread.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In what has been just related we have a remarkable instance of God’s turning the worst devices of the wicked to the purposes of his providence; for in all this was fulfilled the threatening denounced by the Lord against the house of Eli; <span class="ital">because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not; </span>see <a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.">1 Samuel 2:31</a>; and <a href="/1_samuel/3-13.htm" title="For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.">1 Samuel 3:13</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:20-23 David greatly lamented the calamity.

In <a href="//biblehub.com/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a>, he is spoken of as the High Priest who gave the showbread to David. Perhaps he was the instigator of this act of kindness to David; and for this cause, as well as his constancy to David, is mentioned by our Lord instead of Ahimelech. It is also possible that, as sagan to his father, he may have performed most of the priestly functions, as Hophni and Phinehas did in the lifetime of Eli. Abiathar did not actually join David until he went to Keilah (marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 22:20-23.

On hearing his sad tale, David declared that he had dreaded such a fatal result from the malice and intriguing ambition of Doeg; and, accusing himself as having been the occasion of all the disaster to Abiathar's family, David invited him to remain, because, firmly trusting himself in the accomplishment of the divine promise, David could guarantee protection to him.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Abiathar, </span> by his father’s death, was now high priest, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fled after David, </span> to Keilah, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.">1 Samuel 23:6</a>,7</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped,....

Henceforward he was the companion of David’s wanderings, and helped him by “inquiring of the Lord” for him (<a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1 Samuel 23:9</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod.

He held the office of high-priest till the close of David’s reign, when by some strange infatuation, after remaining faithful through Absalom’s rebellion, and “being afflicted in all wherein David was afflicted,” he took part in Adonijah’s rebellion, and was in consequence deposed by Solomon (<a href="/context/1_kings/2-26.htm" title="And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted....">1 Kings 2:26-27</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abiathar escaped.</span> Probably he was left in charge of the sanctuary when Ahimelech and the rest were summoned into the king's presence, and on news being brought of Saul's violence, at once made his escape, Naturally, as representing a family who, though originally Saul's friends, had suffered so much for David, he was kindly received, and a friendship commenced which lasted all David's life; but, taking at last Adonijah's side, he was deprived by Solomon of the high priesthood, and sent into honourable banishment at Anathoth (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>). On hearing of the terrible tragedy from which Abiathar had escaped, David, with characteristic tenderness of conscience, accuses himself of being the cause of all this bloodshed. Perhaps he felt that when he saw Doeg at Nob he ought at once to have gone away, without implicating Ahimelech in his cause; but he could never have imagined that Saul would have treated innocent men so barbarously, and may have supposed that their sacred character as well as their guiltlessness would have secured them from more than temporary displeasure. David now warmly promises Abiathar safety and friendship, and possibly the inversion of the natural order, <span class="cmt_word">he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life</span> (where the <span class="accented">my</span> and <span class="accented">thy</span> are transposed by the Septuagint in one of its usual improvements of the Hebrew text), is meant to express this entire oneness and close union henceforward of the two friends. As to the question when and where Abiathar joined David, see on 1 Samuel 23:6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On receiving this information, Saul immediately summoned the priest Ahimelech and "all his father's house," i.e., the whole priesthood, to Nob, to answer for what they had done. To Saul's appeal, "Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, by giving him bread?" Ahimelech, who was not conscious of any such crime, since David had come to him with a false pretext, and the priest had probably but very little knowledge of what took place at court, replied both calmly and worthily (<a href="/1_samuel/22-14.htm">1 Samuel 22:14</a>): "And who of all thy servants is so faithful (proved, attested, as in <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) as David, and son-in-law of the king, and having access to thy private audience, and honoured in thy house?" The true explanation of &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; &#1505;&#1512; may be gathered from a comparison of <a href="/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-25.htm">1 Chronicles 11:25</a>, where &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1514; occurs again, as the context clearly shows, in the sense of a privy councillor of the king, who hears his personal revelations and converses with him about them, so that it corresponds to our "audience." &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, lit. to turn aside from the way, to go in to any one, or to look after anything (<a href="/exodus/3-3.htm">Exodus 3:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>, etc.); hence in the passage before us "to have access," to be attached to a person. This is the explanation given by Gesenius and most of the modern expositors, whereas the early translators entirely misunderstood the passage, though they have given the meaning correctly enough at <a href="/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a>. But if this was the relation in which David stood to Saul, - and he had really done so for a long time, - there was nothing wrong in what the high priest had done for him; but he had acted according to the best of his knowledge, and quite conscientiously as a faithful subject of the king. Ahimelech then added still further (<a href="/1_samuel/22-15.htm">1 Samuel 22:15</a>): "Did I then begin to inquire of God for him this day?" i.e., was it the first time that I had obtained the decision of God for David concerning important enterprises, which he had to carry out in the service of the king? "Far be from me," sc., any conspiracy against the king, like that of which I am accused. "Let not the king lay it as a burden upon thy servant, my whole father's house (the omission of the cop. &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; may be accounted for from the excitement of the speaker); for thy servant knows not the least of all this." &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, of all that Saul had charged him with. </body></html>
