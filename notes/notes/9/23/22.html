Such expressions, without suitable effects, can only amuse or deceive those who hear, and those who use them. This mountain was an emblem of the Divine Providence coming between David and the destroyer. Let us not be dismayed at the prospect of future difficulties, but stay ourselves upon Him who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working. Sooner than his promise shall fail, he will commission Philistines to effect our escape, at the very moment when our case appears most desperate.

Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us?&#8212;From the tell of Ziph a panorama of the whole surrounding district is to be seen. No wonder, then, that the Ziphites saw David and his men passing to and fro in the mountains of the wilderness. Spying him at a distance when he ventured to show himself on the hill of Hachilah, "on the right hand of the wilderness," that is, the south side of Ziph, they sent in haste to Saul, to tell him of the lurking place of his enemy [Van De Velde].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Prepare yet, </span> to wit, the matter; inform yourselves certainly of things, and dispose them so that we may not be frustrated in our attempt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Where his haunt is; </span> in what cave, or wood, or mountain he is most frequently. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Go, I pray you, prepare yet,....

"There is no trace of this wood now. The land lost its ornament of trees centuries ago through the desolating hand of man" (v. de Velde). "And strengthened his hand in God," i.e., strengthened his heart, not by supplies, or by money, or any subsidy of that kind, but by consolation drawn from his innocence, and the promises of God (vid., <a href="/judges/9-24.htm">Judges 9:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>). "Fear not," said Jonathan to him, "for the hand of Saul my father will not reach thee; and thou wilt become king over Israel, and I will be the second to thee; and Saul my father also knows that it is so." Even though Jonathan had heard nothing from David about his anointing, he could learn from David's course thus far, and from his own father's conduct, that David would not be overcome, but would possess the sovereignty after the death of Saul. Jonathan expresses here, as his firm conviction, what he has intimated once before, in <a href="/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>.; and with the most loving self-denial entreats David, when he shall be king, to let him occupy the second place in the kingdom. It by no means follows from the last words ("Saul my father knoweth"), that Saul had received distinct information concerning the anointing of David, and his divine calling to be king. The words merely contain the thought, he also sees that it will come. The assurance of this must have forced itself involuntarily upon the mind of Saul, both from his own rejection, as foretold by Samuel, and also from the marvellous success of David in all his undertakings. </body></html>
