Saul and his counsellors knew too well whom they had to deal with in the case of the citizens of that faithless, thankless city. It is strange, after all that had passed, that Saul could delude himself that <span class= "ital">his </span>cause was the cause of God, and that David was the reprobate and rejected. The Hebrew word here is remarkable: God hath “repudiated or rejected him.” The LXX. renders “sold him” (into my hands).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/23-7.htm" title="And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.

But it was strange he should imagine that God had taken measures to bring an innocent and pious man into his power, who was a contemner of God, a breaker of his commandments, and one that trampled on all laws, human and divine.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:7-13 Well might David complain of his enemies, that they rewarded him evil for good, and that for his love they were his adversaries. Christ was used thus basely. David applied to his great Protector for direction. No sooner was the ephod brought him than he made use of it. We have the Scriptures in our hands, let us take advice from them in doubtful cases. Say, Bring hither the Bible. David's address to God is very solemn, also very particular. God allows us to be so in our addresses to him; Lord, direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a loss. God knows not only what will be, but what would be, if it were not hindered; therefore he knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and how to render to every man according to his works.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If Gad was with David at the forest of Hareth <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>, and there inquired for him of the Lord <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-4.htm">1 Samuel 23:4</a>, but did not accompany him to Keilah, and if Abiathar's flight occurred at the time of David's being at Keilah, we have an additional striking instance of God's watchful providential care of David in thus sending Abiathar to supply the place of Gad at so critical a moment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 23:7-13.

No doubt it was told him what he came thither for, to relieve it, and deliver it out of the hands of the Philistines, and what success he had; which one would have thought would have reconciled his mind to him, and made him think well of them; but instead of that, it only led him to contrive mischief against him: <p>and Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; as if the success he had given to David was against, him, and in favour of Saul: <p>for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars; while he betook himself to caves, and fields, and woods, he had no great hopes of finding him out, and coming up with him, and seizing him; but now he had got into a fortified place, enclosed with walls, and that had gates to it, kept bolted and barred; when he brought his army against it, and surrounded it, he imagined he would not be able to get out, and escape his hands. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.

When Saul, therefore, heard that David was at Keilah, he said, <span class="cmt_word">God hath delivered him into my hand</span>. The Syriac, Chaldee, and Vulgate translate in the same way, probably as the nearest equivalent to the Hebrew, while the Septuagint has a different reading - <span class="accented">sold</span>. The Hebrew phrase is a very strong one; literally, "God hath ignored him," hath treated him as a stranger, and so let, him fall "into my hand." Possibly Saul s metaphor was taken  from the popular language, and no attempt should be made to get rid of unusual expressions, as if they were false readings. <span class="cmt_word">By entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</span> Either the people of a walled town would give up David rather than expose themselves to the horrors of a siege (<a href="/2_samuel/20-21.htm">2 Samuel 20:21, 22</a>), or, if they stood by him, its capture would be a mere matter of time.

Keilah belonged to the towns of the lowlands of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>); and although it has not yet been discovered, was certainly very close to the Philistian frontier.</body></html>
