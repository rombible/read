Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.">1Samuel 22:5</a>) had summoned David to return with his armed band to Judah. There was a great work ready to his hand in his own country at that juncture. Saul was becoming more and more neglectful of his higher duty—that of protecting his people; as time went on and his malady increased, his whole thoughts were concentrated on David’s imaginary crimes, and the history of the latter part of his reign is little more than a recital of his sad, bewildered efforts to compass the young hero’s destruction. The task of protecting the people from the constant marauding expeditions of the Philistines, and probably of the neighbouring nations, then was entrusted to David. To point this out to the son of Jesse was evidently the first great mission of Gad the seer. Samuel’s mind was, no doubt, busied in this matter. It is more than probable that Gad was first dispatched to join David at the instigation of the aged, but still mentally vigorous, prophet.<p><span class= "bld">Keilah.</span>—“This town lay in the lowlands of Judah, not far from the Philistine frontier, some miles south of Adullam, being perched on a steep hill overlooking the valley of Elah, not far from the thickets of Hareth” (Conder; <span class= "ital">Tent Life in Palestine</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm" title="Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.">1 Samuel 23:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then they told — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">Now they had told David. </span>For it is evident from <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.">1 Samuel 23:6</a>, that David had received the information here referred to, and had even delivered the inhabitants of Keilah before Abiathar came to tell him of the slaughter of the priests. <span class="ital">The Philistines fight against Keilah — </span>Probably the Philistines were encouraged to make this inroad into the land of Israel by hearing that David was forced to flee his country, and that God had departed from Saul.

His first success was the deliverance of the city of <span class="cmt_word">Keilah</span> from a body of Philistines who were  plundering it of the produce of its harvest. This place lay a few miles south of the stronghold of Adullam, and itself occupied a defensible position, being perched on a steep hill overlooking the valley of Elah, not far from the thickets of Hareth (Condor, 'Tent Work,' 2:88). Being thus at no great distance from the Philistine border, a band of men started thence on a foray for the purpose of robbing the <span class="cmt_word">threshing floors</span>. As no rain falls in Palestine in the harvest season (<a href="/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>), the corn is threshed out in the open air by a heavy wooden sledge made of two boards, and curved up in front, with pieces of basalt inserted for teeth, drawn over it by horses, or it is trampled out by cattle. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:259) describes the threshing floor as "a broad flat space on open ground, generally high. Sometimes the floor is on a flat rocky hill top, and occasionally it is in an open valley, down which there is a current of air; but it is always situated where most wind can be found, because at the threshing season high winds never occur, and the grain is safely stored before the autumn storms commence." As the grain after winnowing is made into heaps until it can be carried home, there is always a period when the threshing floors have to be watched to guard them from depredation, and this was the time chosen by the Philistines for a foray in force. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Saul then commanded Doeg to cut down the priests, and he at once performed the bloody deed. On the expression "wearing the linen ephod," compare the remarks at <a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>. The allusion to the priestly clothing, like the repetition of the expression "priests of Jehovah," serves to bring out into its true light the crime of the bloodthirsty Saul and his executioner Doeg. The very dress which the priests wore, as the consecrated servants of Jehovah, ought to have made them shrink from the commission of such a murder. </body></html>
