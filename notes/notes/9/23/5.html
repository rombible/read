One would have imagined that this extraordinary success and deliverance of so great a city might have secured David a safe retreat among the men of Keilah; but it was not so; such is the nature of man, present dangers quickly obliterate past obligations! Gratitude is, without question, a most lovely virtue, but seldom lives in the extremes either of adversity or success!

The way for any country to be quiet, is to let God's church be quiet in it: if Saul fight against David, the Philistines fight against his country. David considered himself the protector of the land. Thus did the Saviour Jesus, and left us an example. Those are unlike David, who sullenly decline to do good, if they are not rewarded for services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If Gad was with David at the forest of Hareth <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>, and there inquired for him of the Lord <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>,<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-4.htm">1 Samuel 23:4</a>, but did not accompany him to Keilah, and if Abiathar's flight occurred at the time of David's being at Keilah, we have an additional striking instance of God's watchful providential care of David in thus sending Abiathar to supply the place of Gad at so critical a moment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-5. David inquired of the Lord&#8212;most probably through Gad (2Sa 24:11; 1Ch 21:9), who was present in David's camp (1Sa 22:5), probably by the recommendation of Samuel. To repel unprovoked assaults on unoffending people who were engaged in their harvest operations, was a humane and benevolent service. But it was doubtful how far it was David's duty to go against a public enemy without the royal commission; and on that account he asked, and obtained, the divine counsel. A demur on the part of his men led David to renew the consultation for their satisfaction; after which, being fully assured of his duty, he encountered the aggressors and, by a signal victory, delivered the people of Keilah from further molestation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Philistines had either brought <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">their cattle</span> out of their land, or had taken from the Israelites in their march, for the sustenance of their army. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So David and his men went to Keilah,....

Then David recognised and confessed his guilt. "I knew that day that the Edomite Doeg was there, that he (i.e., that as the Edomite Doeg was there, he) would tell Saul: I am the cause of all the souls of thy father's house," i.e., of their death. &#1505;&#1489;&#1489; is used here in the sense of being the cause of a thing, which is one of the meanings of the verb in the Arabic and Talmudic (vid., Ges. Lex. s. v.). "Stay with me, fear not; for he who seeks my life seeks thy life: for thou art safe with me." The abstract mishmereth, protection, keeping (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33-34</a>), is used for the concrete, in the sense of protected, well kept. The thought is the following: As no other is seeking thy life than Saul, who also wants to kill me, thou mayest stay with me without fear, as I am sure of divine protection. David spoke thus in the firm belief that the Lord would deliver him from his foe, and give him the kingdom. The action of Saul, which had just been reported to him, could only strengthen him in this belief, as it was a sign of the growing hardness of Saul, which must accelerate his destruction. </body></html>
