Or fools, do I want them? have not I enough of them already at my court? I want wise men, and not fools and madmen. The Jews say (w) that the wife and daughter of Achish were mad; that while David was playing the fool and madman without, they were acting the same part within; so that Achish had enough of that sort of diversion, if it was to be reckoned such; as it was according to the taste of some persons, who used, as in later so in earlier times, to keep fools in their houses to make them sport; but Achish had enough of that, and too much, at least needed no more: <p>that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? or act the part of a fool before me: <p>shall this fellow come into mine house? court or palace, and have a post there; you need be in no pain about it; he is neither agreeable to me, nor fit for any; and therefore Achish drove him away as a fool or madman, instead of imprisoning him as an enemy, or taking away his life; see the title of the thirty fourth psalm, <a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>. <p>(w) Midrash Tillim apud Abarbinel. in loc. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this <i>fellow</i> to play the mad man in my presence? <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> shall this <i>fellow</i> come into my house?</span><p>(k) Is he fit to be in a king's house.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">come into my house</span>] Be taken into my service.

He could take that. David accepted it, as a weapon of greater value to him than any other, because he had not only taken this sword as booty from the Philistine, but had cut off the head of Goliath with it (see <a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>).
