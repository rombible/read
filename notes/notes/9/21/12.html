The life he held so cheaply when in battle with the enemies of his country now, strange to say, in his deep degradation and poverty, became of real value to him, and he adopted the piteous and humiliating device of feigning madness, hoping thus to change the wondering admiration of the servants of Achish into pitying scorn. What David hoped took place, and he was driven out of Gath with ignominy; but there is no reason for supposing that had he maintained a quiet dignity of behaviour any evil would have happened to him. The Philistines, for those wild times, seem to have been a cultured people, and by no means devoid of generous instincts. Not one word, strangely enough, is reported to have been spoken about the great injury he had done to the Philistine nation when he slew Goliath. It has been suggested with considerable ingenuity that the great name of the dead champion, the hero of so many battle-fields, was never brought forward here, perhaps out of a natural indisposition to recall a grievous calamity, but more likely out of regard for Goliath’s family and friends. Singularly little is told us, in fact, about this renowned hero, whom tradition hints at as the great warrior in the decisive battle when the Ark was captured and the sons of Eli were slain. The Talmud has a curious comment on this strange silence—“Not half the praises of Goliath are related in Scripture; hence it follows that it is wrong to tell the praises of the wicked.”—Treatise <span class= "ital">Soteh, </span>fol. 42, Colossians 2.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/21-12.htm" title="And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.">1 Samuel 21:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">David laid up these words in his heart </span>— It is probable he had been at first well received, but this discourse deeply affected him, and made him think himself not safe there.

David had reason to put confidence in Achish, yet he began to be afraid. His conduct was degrading, and discovered wavering in his faith and courage.

At Gath He Feigns Himself Mad.<p>10. David &#8230; fled &#8230; to Achish the king of Gath&#8212;which was one of the five principalities of the Philistines. In this place his person must have been known, and to venture into that country, he their greatest enemy, and with the sword of Goliath in his hand, would seem to have been a perilous experiment; but, doubtless, the protection he received implies that he had been directed by the divine oracle. Achish was generous (1Sa 27:6). He might wish to weaken the resources of Saul, and it was common in ancient times for great men to be harbored by neighboring princes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Lest either their revenge or policy should prompt them to kill him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David laid up these words in his heart,....

There at the sanctuary there was a man of Saul's servants, &#1504;&#1506;&#1510;&#1512;, i.e., "kept back (shut off) before Jehovah:" i.e., at the sanctuary of the tabernacle, either for the sake of purification or as a proselyte, who wished to be received into the religious communion of Israel, or because of supposed leprosy, according to <a href="/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4</a>. His name was Doeg the Edomite, &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, "the strong one (i.e., the overseer) of the herdsmen of Saul."<p>(Note: The Septuagint translators have rendered these words &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, "feeding the mules of Saul;" and accordingly in <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a> also they have changed Saul's servants into mules, in accordance with which Thenius makes Doeg the upper herdsman of Saul. But it is very evident that the text of the lxx is nothing more than a subjective interpretation of the expression before us, and does not presuppose any other text, from the simple fact that all the other ancient versions are founded upon the Hebrew text both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>, including even the Vulgate (potentissimus pastorum); and the clause contained in some of the MSS of the Vulgate (his pascebat mulas Saul) is nothing more than a gloss that has crept in from the Itala; and this is still more obvious in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>, where &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is applicable enough to &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;, but is altogether unsuitable in connection with &#1508;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;, since &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; is no more applied in Hebrew to herdsmen or keepers of animals, than we should think of speaking of presidents of asses, horses, etc. Moreover, it is not till the reign of David that we read of mules being used as riding animals by royal princes (<a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>); and they are mentioned for the first time as beasts of burden, along with asses, camels, and oxen, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-40.htm">1 Chronicles 12:40</a>, where they are said to have been employed by the northern tribes to carry provisions to Hebron to the festival held at the recognition of David as king. Before David's time the sons of princes rode upon asses (vid., <a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="/judges/12-14.htm">Judges 12:14</a>).)</body></html>
