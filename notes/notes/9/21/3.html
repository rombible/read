Doubtless, Ahimelech had other provisions in his house; but David was in great haste, and in fear of Doeg, whom he saw and knew, and therefore would not stay till any thing could be fetched from thence. There seemed to be a double impediment to Ahimelech’s giving David and his servants this bread: 1st, Its sacredness in itself, which he intimates, and in answer to which David pleads his great necessity; an answer with which Ahimelech appears to have been satisfied. “Cases of necessity, as the Jews themselves allow, often superseded the observance of the ritual laws; and this compliance of Ahimelech is urged with great force by our Saviour, in vindication of a similar infringement, <a href="/mark/2-25.htm" title="And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with him?">Mark 2:25</a>.” — Dodd. 2d, It was requisite that all who ate of the holy bread, should have observed the same purity which was required of the priests, particularly in the instance of abstinence from all women; and Ahimelech suspected that David or his servants might possibly want this qualification, and therefore inquires concerning it. But out of respect to David he does not name him, but asks only concerning the young men. David’s answer, however, shows that he was intended to be included in the inquiry.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 David, in distress, fled to the tabernacle of God. It is great comfort in a day of trouble, that we have a God to go to, to whom we may open our cases, and from whom we may ask and expect direction. David told Ahimelech a gross untruth. What shall we say to this? The Scripture does not conceal it, and we dare not justify it; it was ill done, and proved of bad consequence; for it occasioned the death of the priests of the Lord. David thought upon it afterward with regret. David had great faith and courage, yet both failed him; he fell thus foully through fear and cowardice, and owing to the weakness of his faith. Had he trusted God aright, he would not have used such a sorry, sinful shift for his own preservation. It is written, not for us to do the like, no, not in the greatest straits, but for our warning. David asked of Ahimelech bread and a sword. Ahimelech supposed they might eat the shew-bread. The Son of David taught from it, that mercy is to be preferred to sacrifice; that ritual observances must give way to moral duties. Doeg set his foot as far within the tabernacle as David did. We little know with what hearts people come to the house of God, nor what use they will make of pretended devotion. If many come in simplicity of heart to serve their God, others come to observe their teachers and to prove accusers. Only God and the event can distinguish between a David and a Doeg, when both are in the tabernacle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A fresh instance of David's unscrupulous readiness of invention (compare <a href="/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know&#8212;This was a direct falsehood, extorted through fear. David probably supposed, like many other persons, that a lie is quite excusable which is told for the sole purpose of saving the speaker's life. But what is essentially sinful, can never, from circumstances, change its immoral character; and David had to repent of this vice of lying (Ps 119:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Under thine hand, </span> to wit, in thy power, and ready for thee to give, and for me to take, and eat. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore what is under thine hand?....

As Ahimelech could not venture to refuse David's request, he asks if his attendants are at least ceremonially clean, as in that case the urgency of the king's business might excuse the breach of the letter of the commandment.
