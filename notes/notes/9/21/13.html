The poem in question is, however, of a general, not of an historical character, and especially celebrates Jehovah’s guardian care of the righteous. Its “acrostic” arrangement, however, suggests a later date than the time of David. If, as is quite possible, the royal psalmist was the original author, and that the deliverance on the present occasion suggested the theme, then it must have been brought into its present form by some later temple musician.<p><span class= "bld">Feigned himself mad.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">he roamed hither and thither</span>, <span class= "ital">restless and in terror.</span>—Dean Payne Smith. “In their hands,” that is, “in their presence.” Some have supposed that the madness was not “simulated,” but <span class= "ital">real. </span>Wrought upon by excitement of fear and terrible anxiety, it has been suggested that the mind for a time lost its balance, and that David became temporarily really insane; but the sense of the narrative plainly indicates that the madness was feigned.<p><span class= "bld">Scrabbled on the doors of the gate.</span>—Scratched on them; “scrabble” being probably a diminutive of “scrape” (Richardson, <span class= "ital">Dictionary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>By others it is connected with “scribble.” the root in either case being ultimately the same.

It has been cleverly suggested that David was only too well acquainted with all the signs of madness, from his long and intimate association with King Saul in his darker hours of insanity. There are other well-authenticated examples in history of great heroes, in seasons of sore danger, feigning madness like David, with a view of escaping from their enemies. For instance, according to the Shâhnâmeh, Kai Khosrev feigned idiocy in face of mortal peril.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/21-13.htm" title="And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.">1 Samuel 21:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">He feigned himself mad — </span>That he might escape out of their hands.

The title of Psalms 56. states that it was written by David “when the Philistines laid hold on him in Gath,” and though it is not expressly said here that he was arrested, the words “feigned himself mad <span class="ital">in their hands</span>” together with the mention of his <span class="ital">escape</span> in <a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm" title="David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.">1 Samuel 22:1</a>, seem to imply that he was a prisoner.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">feigned himself mad</span>] So that they might suppose him harmless.

Literally it means "his taste," and, like the Latin word <span class="accented">sapientia</span>, is derived from the action of the palate, and so from the faculty of discriminating flavours it came to signify the power of discrimination generally. Thus "to change his taste" means to act as if he had lost the power of distinguishing between objects. <span class="cmt_word">Feigned himself mad.</span> Literally, "he roamed hither and thither" restlessly and in terror. <span class="cmt_word">In their hands.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> before them, in their presence. <span class="cmt_word">Scrabbled on the doors of the gate.</span> The Vulgate and Septuagint read <span class="accented">drummed</span> upon them. Literally the verb means "to make the mark of a Tau," the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and which anciently was in the form of a cross. The gate, on the leaves of which David scrawled, was probably that of the court or waiting room, in which the servants of Achish passed their time when in attendance upon him. Possibly David had witnessed these symptoms of madness in Saul's case during his fits of insanity. The idea of some of the older commentators, that David really for a time went out of his mind, is opposed to the general sense of the narrative. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The priest then gave him (what was) holy, namely the shew-loaves "that were taken from before Jehovah," i.e., from the holy table, upon which they had lain before Jehovah for seven days (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6-9</a>). - In <a href="/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a> there is a parenthetical remark introduced, which was of great importance in relation to the consequences of this occurrence. There at the sanctuary there was a man of Saul's servants, &#1504;&#1506;&#1510;&#1512;, i.e., "kept back (shut off) before Jehovah:" i.e., at the sanctuary of the tabernacle, either for the sake of purification or as a proselyte, who wished to be received into the religious communion of Israel, or because of supposed leprosy, according to <a href="/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4</a>. His name was Doeg the Edomite, &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, "the strong one (i.e., the overseer) of the herdsmen of Saul."<p>(Note: The Septuagint translators have rendered these words &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, "feeding the mules of Saul;" and accordingly in <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a> also they have changed Saul's servants into mules, in accordance with which Thenius makes Doeg the upper herdsman of Saul. But it is very evident that the text of the lxx is nothing more than a subjective interpretation of the expression before us, and does not presuppose any other text, from the simple fact that all the other ancient versions are founded upon the Hebrew text both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>, including even the Vulgate (potentissimus pastorum); and the clause contained in some of the MSS of the Vulgate (his pascebat mulas Saul) is nothing more than a gloss that has crept in from the Itala; and this is still more obvious in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>, where &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is applicable enough to &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;, but is altogether unsuitable in connection with &#1508;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;, since &#1504;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; is no more applied in Hebrew to herdsmen or keepers of animals, than we should think of speaking of presidents of asses, horses, etc. Moreover, it is not till the reign of David that we read of mules being used as riding animals by royal princes (<a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>); and they are mentioned for the first time as beasts of burden, along with asses, camels, and oxen, in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-40.htm">1 Chronicles 12:40</a>, where they are said to have been employed by the northern tribes to carry provisions to Hebron to the festival held at the recognition of David as king. Before David's time the sons of princes rode upon asses (vid., <a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="/judges/12-14.htm">Judges 12:14</a>).)</body></html>
