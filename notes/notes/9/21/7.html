MSS. there is an explanatory gloss, evidently derived from the singular interpretation of the LXX., <span class= "ital">“</span>This (man) used to feed Saul’s mules.” There can be no foundation in tradition or otherwise for such a reading, as we never read until the days of King David of mules being used by royal princes. (See <a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm" title="And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.">2Samuel 13:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm" title="And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode on a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.">2Samuel 18:9</a>.) Before David’s time, the sons of princes used to ride on asses. (See <a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>.) Ewald, disregarding the current Jewish tradition respecting the ancient connection of Doeg with the house of Kish, considers that this influential chieftain of the king probably came over to Saul in his war with Edom.<p><span class= "bld">Detained before the Lord.</span>—Several interpretations have been suggested for these words. (a) He was at the sanctuary of the Tabernacle as a proselyte—one who wished to be received into the religious communion of Israel. (b) He was detained there for his purification on account of supposed leprosy, or simply in fulfilment of a temporary Nazarite vow. (c) According to Ephrem Syrus (who probably referred to some lost tradition), he had committed some trespass, and was detained there till he had offered the appointed sacrifice. Any one of these reasons—all sufficiently probable in themselves—would have occasioned a residence long or short at the sanctuary at Nob. At all events, when the fugitive David recognised the presence of one of Saul’s most unscrupulous servants, whom he must have known well, his mind must have misgiven him, and he, probably on this account, hasted to get away, and at once begs the old high priest to furnish him with any arms he might have laid up in the priestly homes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/21-7.htm" title="Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the most chief of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.">1 Samuel 21:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Detained before the Lord — </span>That is, at the tabernacle.

It is great comfort in a day of trouble, that we have a God to go to, to whom we may open our cases, and from whom we may ask and expect direction. David told Ahimelech a gross untruth. What shall we say to this? The Scripture does not conceal it, and we dare not justify it; it was ill done, and proved of bad consequence; for it occasioned the death of the priests of the Lord. David thought upon it afterward with regret. David had great faith and courage, yet both failed him; he fell thus foully through fear and cowardice, and owing to the weakness of his faith. Had he trusted God aright, he would not have used such a sorry, sinful shift for his own preservation. It is written, not for us to do the like, no, not in the greatest straits, but for our warning. David asked of Ahimelech bread and a sword. Ahimelech supposed they might eat the shew-bread. The Son of David taught from it, that mercy is to be preferred to sacrifice; that ritual observances must give way to moral duties. Doeg set his foot as far within the tabernacle as David did. We little know with what hearts people come to the house of God, nor what use they will make of pretended devotion. If many come in simplicity of heart to serve their God, others come to observe their teachers and to prove accusers. Only God and the event can distinguish between a David and a Doeg, when both are in the tabernacle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Detained before the Lord - Either to fulfill a vow <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-27</a>, or on account of uncleanness, or under the law of lepers <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-11.htm">Leviticus 13:11</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-21.htm">Leviticus 13:21</a>, or as a proselyte.

Unfortunately there chanced to be a person present there who informed the king of it, and brought a second terrible catastrophe upon the house of Eli (see on 1 Samuel 2:33); by working too upon his jealousy he caused Saul to commit a crime which sets him before us as a hateful and remorseless tyrant. This man was <span class="cmt_word">Doeg, an Edomite,</span> who had, it seems, long been in Saul's service, as he was his chief herdsman. According to the Septuagint he had charge of the king's mules, but the other versions agree with the Hebrew. As herds would form the main part of Saul's wealth, his chief herdsman would be a person of importance. He was <span class="cmt_word">detained before Jehovah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> shut up in close seclusion within the precincts of the tabernacle, either for some vow, or for purification, or perhaps as suspected of leprosy (<a href="/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4</a>), or, as some think, as a proselyte. Ephrem Syrus thinks he had committed some trespass, and was detained till he had offered the appointed sacrifice. David at once felt that Doeg's presence boded much ill (<a href="/1_samuel/22-22.htm">1 Samuel 22:22</a>), and it probably was the cause of his taking the rash resolution to flee for refuge to Gath. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David at Nob. - The town of Nob or Nobeh (unless indeed the form &#1504;&#1489;&#1492; stands for &#1504;&#1489;&#1492; here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>, and the &#1492; attached is merely &#1492; local, as the name is always written &#1504;&#1489; in other places: vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-11.htm">1 Samuel 22:11</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-32.htm">Nehemiah 11:32</a>) was at that time a priests' city (<a href="/1_samuel/22-19.htm">1 Samuel 22:19</a>), in which, according to the following account, the tabernacle was then standing, and the legal worship carried on. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32</a>, it was between Anathoth (Anata) and Jerusalem, and in all probability it has been preserved in the village of el-Isawiyeh, i.e., probably the village of Esau or Edom, which is midway between Anata and Jerusalem, an hour from the latter, and the same distance to the south-east of Gibeah of Saul (Tell el Phul), and which bears all the marks of an ancient place, partly in its dwellings, the stones of which date from a great antiquity, and partly in many marble columns which are found there (vid., Tobler, Topogr. v. Jerusalem ii. p. 720). Hence v. Raumer (Pal. p. 215, ed. 4) follows Kiepert in the map which he has appended to Robinson's Biblical Researches, and set down this place as the ancient Nob, for which Robinson indeed searched in vain (see Pal. ii. p. 150). Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, most probably the same person as Ahiah (<a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>), was "the priest," i.e., the high priest (see at <a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>). When David came to him, the priest "went trembling to meet him" (&#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;&#1491;) with the inquiry, "Why art thou alone, and no one is with thee?" The unexpected appearance of David, the son-in-law of the king, without any attendants, alarmed Ahimelech, who probably imagined that he had come with a commission from the king which might involve him in danger. David had left the few servants who accompanied him in his flight somewhere in the neighbourhood, as we may gather from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a>, because he wished to converse with the high priest alone. Ahimelech's anxious inquiry led David to resort to the fabrication described in <a href="/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a> : "The king hath commanded me a business, and said to me, No one is to know anything of this matter, in which (lit. in relation to the matter with regard to which) I send thee, and which I have entrusted to thee (i.e., no one is to know either the occasion or the nature of the commission): and the servants I have directed to such and such a place." &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, Poel, to cause to know, point, show. Ahimelech had received no information as yet concerning the most recent occurrences between Saul and David; and David would not confess to him that he was fleeing from Saul, because he was evidently afraid that the high priest would not give him any assistance, lest he should draw down the wrath of the king. This falsehood brought he greatest calamities upon Ahimelech and the priests at Nob (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9-19</a>), and David was afterwards obliged to confess that he had occasioned it all (<a href="/1_samuel/22-22.htm">1 Samuel 22:22</a>).</body></html>
