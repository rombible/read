Thus Alexander at first takes the royal divining cup from Dârâ as if in sport: a story which in the Shâhnâmeh no longer appears in its original light; and in nothing was the belief in omens so strong as in the high affairs of state.”—“David,” ii. 3 (Note).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-12 How soon do unholy hearts lose the good impressions convictions have made upon them! How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as though disarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are only asleep. How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation, and trusted God with the event.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ahimelech the Hittite - Only mentioned here.

A "cruse of water" is usually, in warm climates, kept near a person's couch, as a drink in the night time is found very refreshing.

When he saw the place where Saul and his general Abner were lying - Saul was lying by the waggon rampart, and the fighting men were encamped round about him - he said to Ahimelech and Abishai, "Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?" Whereupon Abishai declared himself ready to do so; and they both went by night, and found Saul sleeping with all the people. Ahimelech the Hittite is never mentioned again; but Abishai the son of Zeruiah, David's sister (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>), and a brother of Joab, was afterwards a celebrated general of David, as was also his brother Joab (<a href="/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-2.htm">2 Samuel 18:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>). Saul's spear was pressed (stuck) into the ground at his head, as a sign that the king was sleeping there, for the spear served Saul as a sceptre (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>).</body></html>
