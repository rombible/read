The conspicuous trophy of his late “night raid” was in his hand; we can imagine the first rays of the morning sun lighting up the glittering royal spear grasped by David. Saul could not help recognising that at least the son of Jesse sought not his life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:13-20 David reasoned seriously and affectionately with Saul. Those who forbid our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an offering from us both. Let us join in seeking peace, and to be reconciled with God by sacrifice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This incidental testimony to Abner's great eminence as a warrior is fully borne out by David's dirge at Abner's death <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31-34</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-38.htm">2 Samuel 3:38</a>, as well as by his whole history. At the same time David's bantering tone in regard to Abner, coupled with what he says in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>, makes it proable that David attributed Saul's persecution of him in some degree to Abner. Abner would be likely to dread a rival in the young conqueror of Judah (compare <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man: &#8230; wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?&#8212;The circumstance of David having penetrated to the center of the encampment, through the circular rows of the sleeping soldiers, constituted the point of this sarcastic taunt.
