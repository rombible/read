How helpless were Saul and all his men! All as though disarmed and chained, yet nothing is done to them; they are only asleep. How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation, and trusted God with the event.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The incident related in this chapter of the meeting between Saul and David bears a strong general resemblance to that recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/24.htm">1 Samuel 24</a>, and is of a nature unlikely to have occurred more than once. Existing discrepancies are explained by the supposition that one narrative relates fully some incidents on which the other is silent. On the whole the most probable conclusion is that the two narratives relate to one and the same event. (Compare the two narratives of the Creation, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>; <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> ff; the two narratives of David's war, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>; and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10</a>; and those of the death of Ahaziah, <a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a> ff; and <a href="/2_chronicles/22-9.htm">2 Chronicles 22:9</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 26<p>1Sa 26:1-4. Saul Comes to the Hill of Hachilah against David.<p>1, 2. the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah&#8212;This people seem to have thought it impossible for David to escape, and therefore recommended themselves to Saul, by giving him secret information (see on [251]1Sa 23:19). The knowledge of their treachery makes it appear strange that David should return to his former haunt in their neighborhood; but, perhaps he did it to be near Abigail's possessions, and under the impression that Saul had become mollified. But the king had relapsed into his old enmity. Though Gibeah, as its name imports, stood on an elevated position, and the desert of Ziph, which was in the hilly region of Judea, may have been higher than Gibeah, it was still necessary to descend in leaving the latter place; thence Saul (1Sa 26:2) "went down to the wilderness of Ziph."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. He understood by information, probably from his dear friend Jonathan. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way,....
