Those who forbid our attendance on God's ordinances, do what they can to estrange us from God, and to make us heathens. We are to reckon that which exposes us to sin the greatest injury that can be done us. If the Lord stirred thee up against me, either in displeasure to me, taking this way to punish me for my sins against him, or in displeasure to thee, if it be the effect of that evil spirit from the Lord which troubles thee; let Him accept an offering from us both.

Then David &#8230; stood on the top of an hill afar off &#8230; and cried to the people&#8212;(See on [252]Jud 9:7). The extraordinary purity and elasticity of the air in Palestine enable words to be distinctly heard that are addressed by a speaker from the top of one hill to people on that of another, from which it is separated by a deep intervening ravine. Hostile parties can thus speak to each other, while completely beyond the reach of each other's attack. It results from the peculiar features of the country in many of the mountain districts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">with or beside the king, </span> i.e. so near to him, so as to disturb the king. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David cried unto the people,....

Kimchi and Ben Melech explain it, upon the king, or over him; and the Targum is, at the head of the king; the meaning is, how he could act such a part as to call so loud within the king's hearing, as to disturb the king's rest, and awake him out of his sleep. <p>(s)  "juxta regem", Vatablus (t) Ceram rege, Nodlus, p. 58.
