How easily can God weaken the strongest, befool the wisest, and baffle the most watchful! David still resolved to wait till God thought fit to avenge him on Saul. He will by no means force his way to the promised crown by any wrong methods. The temptation was very strong; but if he yielded, he would sin against God, therefore he resisted the temptation, and trusted God with the event.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ahimelech the Hittite - Only mentioned here.

Though Saul's cruelty and perfidy and general want of right principle had sunk him to a low pitch of degradation, yet that was no reason for David's imitating him in doing wrong. Besides, he was the sovereign; David was a subject. Though God had rejected him from the kingdom, it was in every way the best and most dutiful course, instead of precipitating his fall by imbruing their hands in his blood and thereby contracting the guilt of a great crime, to wait the awards of that retributive providence which sooner or later would take him off by some sudden and mortal blow. He who, with impetuous haste was going to exterminate Nabal, meekly spared Saul. But Nabal refused to give a tribute to which justice and gratitude, no less than custom, entitled David. Saul was under the judicial infatuation of heaven. Thus David withheld the hand of Abishai; but, at the same time, he directed him to carry off some things which would show where they had been, and what they had done. Thus he obtained the best of victories over him, by heaping coals of fire on his head.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I will nail him to the ground at one blow, that I shall not need a second stroke. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said Abishai to David,....

He remembered that David would not put forth his hand to stay him before, when he had an opportunity; and since now another offered, he did not move it to him to do it, but begged leave to do it himself; which he might think would be granted, since there was such a remarkable hand of Providence in it, which seemed to direct to such a step: <p>even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time; signifying, that he would give such a home blow or thrust, that the spear should pierce through him, and fasten him to the ground, that there would be no need to repeat it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_samuel/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not <i>smite</i> him the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> second time.</span><p>(d) Meaning, he would make him sure at one stroke.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_samuel/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">hath delivered</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">shut up</span>, as in <a href="/1_samuel/24-18.htm" title="And you have showed this day how that you have dealt well with me: for as much as when the LORD had delivered me into your hand, you killed me not.">1 Samuel 24:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">at once</span>] Not “immediately,” but <span class="bld">“with one stroke.”</span><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second betrayal of David by the Ziphites occurred after David had married Abigail at Carmel, and when he had already returned to the desert of Judah.
