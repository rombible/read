The command from the Eternal Friend to come and anoint “the son of Jesse of Bethlehem” had been definite, but the sons of Jesse had passed before him, and no sign had been vouch-safed to him indicating that God had chosen one of these youths of whom the father was so fond; so the seer asks, “Are these all thy children?”<p><span class= "bld">There remaineth yet the youngest.</span>—Why David was kept in the background is uncertain. He, clearly, was different to the stalwart band of elder brothers who were grouped round their father. Although fair to look on, his beauty was of a very different type to that of his brothers, probably, compared with Saul and his own brothers, little of stature, with reddish-brown hair and a fair complexion. His father and the men in the village thought less of him than of his dark, tall brothers: at all events, Jesse thought him of too little account to present to Samuel. But, as so often, God’s thoughts are not our thoughts, and in a moment Samuel saw that in the ruddy shepherd boy—small of stature, and held of little account in his father’s house—he beheld the future king of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm" title="And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children?

Either, therefore, he did not understand David’s wisdom and valour, or he judged him unfit, by reason of his mean education. And God so ordered it by his providence, that the choice of David might plainly appear to be God’s work, and not Samuel’s or Jesse’s. David signifies <span class="ital">beloved; </span>a fit name for so eminent a type of God’s beloved Son. It is supposed David was now about twenty years old. If so, his troubles by Saul lasted near ten years; for he was thirty years old when Saul died. Samuel, having done this, went to Ramah. He retired to die in peace, since his eyes had seen the salvation, even the sceptre brought into the tribe of Judah.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:6-13 It was strange that Samuel, who had been so disappointed in Saul, whose countenance and stature recommended him, should judge of another man by that rule. We can tell how men look, but God can tell what they are. He judges of men by the heart. We often form a mistaken judgment of characters; but the Lord values only the faith, fear, and love, which are planted in the heart, beyond human discernment. And God does not favour our children according to our fond partiality, but often most honours and blesses those who have been least regarded. David at length was pitched upon. He was the youngest of the sons of Jesse; his name signifies Beloved; he was a type of God's beloved Son. It should seem, David was least set by of all the sons of Jesse. But the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. His anointing was not an empty ceremony, a Divine power went with that instituted sign; he found himself advanced in wisdom and courage, with all the qualifications of a prince, though not advanced in his outward circumstances. This would satisfy him that his election was of God. The best evidence of our being predestinated to the kingdom of glory, is, our being sealed with the Spirit of promise, and experience of a work of grace in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We will not sit down ... - . literally, we will not turn round to sit at the table. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Sa 16:11-14.

God, in His providence, so ordered it, that the appointment of David might the more clearly appear to be a divine purpose, and not the design either of Samuel or Jesse. David having not been sanctified with the rest of his family, it is probable that he returned to his pastoral duties the moment the special business on which he had been summoned was done.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He keepeth the sheep; </span> and consequently is the most unfit of all my sons for that high employment.

It is not affirmed that David did sit down with them to the feast, but only that they would not do so till he came. And when he was come, and Samuel had done what he intended with him, David, for aught we know, might depart, and the rest sit down to the feast; for David was not now actually raised to any higher degree, but returned to his former employment; as we read below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/16-19.htm" title="Why Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, which is with the sheep.">1 Samuel 16:19</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Samuel said unto Jesse, are here all thy children?....

The prophet now orders him to be summoned, and marks his value in God's sight by saying, <span class="cmt_word">We will not sit down till he come hither.</span> The verb literally means, <span class="accented">we will not surround, i.e.</span> the table, though at this time the Jews did sit at meals, instead of reclining on couches, as in the days of Amos and our Lord. We gather, moreover, from Samuel's words that the selection of the son that was to be anointed took place while the preparations were being made for the feast. At the prophet's command David is fetched from the flock, which was probably near the house, and on his arrival the prophet sees a <span class="cmt_word">ruddy</span> boy, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> red-haired, correctly rendered in the Vulgate <span class="accented">rufus</span>, the colour loved by all painters of manly beauty, and, from the delicacy of complexion which accompanies it, especially admired in the East, where men are generally dark-haired and sallow-faced. Moreover, he was <span class="cmt_word">of a beautiful countenance.</span> The Hebrew says, "with beautiful eyes," and so the Syriac and Septuagint rightly. He was also <span class="cmt_word">goodly to look to,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to look at. These last words give the general idea of the beauty of his face and person, while his bright hair and delicate complexion and the beauty of his eyes are specially noticed in the Hebrew. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Samuel quieted them with the reply that he was come to offer sacrifice to the Lord, and called upon them to sanctify themselves and take part in the sacrifice. It is evident from this that the prophet was accustomed to turn his visits to account by offering sacrifice, and so building up the people in fellowship with the Lord. The reason why sacrifices were offered at different places was, that since the removal of the ark from the tabernacle, this sanctuary had ceased to be the only place of the nation's worship. &#1492;&#1514;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to sanctify one's self by washings and legal purifications, which probably preceded every sacrificial festival (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>, <a href="/exodus/19-22.htm">Exodus 19:22</a>). The expression, "Come with me to the sacrifice," is constructio praegnans for "Come and take part in the sacrifice." "Call to the sacrifice" (<a href="/1_samuel/16-3.htm">1 Samuel 16:3</a>) is to be understood in the same way. &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; is the slain-offering, which was connected with every sacrificial meal. It is evident from the following words, "and he sanctified Jesse and his sons," that Samuel addressed the general summons to sanctify themselves more especially to Jesse and his sons. For it was with them that he was about to celebrate the sacrificial meal.</body></html>
