Now he was ruddy, and with of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he....">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord said, </span>&c. — Spoke secretly by his Spirit to Samuel’s heart; for it is not probable that any audible voice was uttered. <span class="ital">Samuel anointed him in the midst of his brethren — </span>This is a perfectly literal translation of the Hebrew, confirmed by the Seventy; and the words seem evidently to imply that he was anointed publicly among his brethren. But though they saw his unction, it is probable they had no idea that he was anointed to the kingdom, but were only told by Samuel that it was to some great service, which they should be informed of hereafter. Samuel certainly was afraid to have it known at present that he was anointed to be king, and therefore would not tell it out among his brethren. And by Eliab’s treatment of David after this, (<a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm" title="And Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle.">1 Samuel 17:28</a>,) it appears that he did not know him to be the king elect of God’s people. Thus Jesse only and David understood the whole business; but his brethren would be able to bear witness to the fact of Samuel’s anointing him, which, with other collateral evidences, would be abundantly sufficient to prove David’s right to the kingdom, if need should be. Dr. Waterland proposes to translate the words, <span class="ital">from the midst, </span>instead of <span class="ital">in the midst; </span>but Houbigant approves of our reading, and thinks the anointing was made publicly, as has just been stated, but that Samuel did not signify, unless to Jesse, the purpose for which he was anointed. <span class="ital">The Spirit of the Lord came upon David, </span>&c. — That is, he was immediately endowed with extraordinary gifts of God’s Spirit, as strength, and courage, and wisdom, and other excellent qualities, which prepared him for, and excited him to, noble attempts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:6-13 It was strange that Samuel, who had been so disappointed in Saul, whose countenance and stature recommended him, should judge of another man by that rule. We can tell how men look, but God can tell what they are. He judges of men by the heart. We often form a mistaken judgment of characters; but the Lord values only the faith, fear, and love, which are planted in the heart, beyond human discernment. And God does not favour our children according to our fond partiality, but often most honours and blesses those who have been least regarded. David at length was pitched upon. He was the youngest of the sons of Jesse; his name signifies Beloved; he was a type of God's beloved Son. It should seem, David was least set by of all the sons of Jesse. But the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. His anointing was not an empty ceremony, a Divine power went with that instituted sign; he found himself advanced in wisdom and courage, with all the qualifications of a prince, though not advanced in his outward circumstances. This would satisfy him that his election was of God. The best evidence of our being predestinated to the kingdom of glory, is, our being sealed with the Spirit of promise, and experience of a work of grace in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We will not sit down ... - . literally, we will not turn round to sit at the table. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. he was ruddy, &c.&#8212;Josephus says that David was ten, while most modern commentators are of the opinion that he must have been fifteen years of age.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He was ruddy; </span> which may be referred either to the colour of his hair; or rather, to the complexion of his face. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Goodly to look to; </span> of a comely but masculine and majestic aspect. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sent and brought him in,....
