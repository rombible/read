In the first instance, all the priests were anointed (<a href="/exodus/40-15.htm" title="And you shall anoint them, as you did anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.">Exodus 40:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-3.htm" title="These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.">Numbers 3:3</a>), but afterwards anointing seems to have been reserved especially for the high priest (<a href="/exodus/29-29.htm" title="And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.">Exodus 29:29</a>). Prophets also seem occasionally to have been anointed to their holy office. Anointing, however, was the principal ceremony in the inauguration of the Hebrew kings. It belonged in so especial a manner to the royal functions that the favourite designation for the king in Israel was “the Lord’s anointed.” In the case of David, the ceremony of anointing was performed three times—(1) on this occasion by Samuel, when the boy was set apart for the service of the Lord; (2) when appointed king over Judah at Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm" title="And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.">2Samuel 2:4</a>); (3) when chosen as monarch over all Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm" title="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.">2Samuel 5:3</a>). All these official personages, the priest, the prophet, and peculiarly the king, were types of the great expected Deliverer, ever known as the “Messiah,” “the Christ,” “the Anointed One.”<p>Wordsworth curiously considers these three successive unctions of David figurative of the successive unctions of Christ: conceived by the Holy Ghost in the Virgin’s womb; then anointed publicly at his baptism; and finally, set at God’s right hand as King of the Universal Church in the heavenly Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_samuel/16-3.htm" title="And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you....">1 Samuel 16:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Call Jesse to the sacrifice — </span>To the feast upon the sacrifice, to which they might invite their neighbours and friends. <span class="ital">The elders trembled at his coming — </span>Because it was strange and unexpected to them, this being but an obscure town, and remote from Samuel, and therefore they justly thought there was some extraordinary reason for it.

Of what would he not be guilty, who durst think to kill Samuel? The elders of Bethlehem trembled at Samuel's coming. It becomes us to stand in awe of God's messengers, and to tremble at his word. His answer was, I come peaceably, for I come to sacrifice. When our Lord Jesus came into the world, though men had reason to fear that his errand was to condemn the world, yet he gave full assurance that he came peaceably, for he came to sacrifice, and he brought his offering with him; A body hast thou prepared me. Let us sanctify ourselves, and depend upon His sacrifice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was the purpose of God that David should be anointed at this time as Saul's successor, and as the ancestor and the type of His Christ. It was not the purpose of God that Samuel should stir up a civil war, by setting up David as Saul's rival. Secrecy, therefore, was a necessary part of the transaction. But secrecy and concealment are not the same as duplicity and falsehood. Concealment of a good purpose, for a good purpose, is clearly justifiable. There is therefore nothing in the least inconsistent with truth in the occurrence here related.

It is plain that such sacrifices were not unusual, or Saul would have demanded a reason for Samuel's conduct. As the ark remained so long in obscurity at Kirjath-jearim, and the solemn services of the tabernacle were not restored until Saul at some period of his reign removed it to Nob, possibly Samuel may have instituted this practice of occasionally holding sacrifices, now at one place and now at another, to keep alive a sense of religion in the hearts of the people; and probably on such occasions he taught them the great truths of the law, thus combining in his person the offices of prophet and priest. Nevertheless, <span class="cmt_word">the elders of the town trembled at his coming.</span> More literally, "went with trembling to meet him." Very probably such visitations often took place because some crime had been committed into which Samuel wished to inquire, or because the people had been negligent in some duty. And though conscious of no such fault, yet at the coming of one of such high rank their minds foreboded evil. He quiets, however, their fears and bids them <span class="cmt_word">sanctify</span> themselves; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they were to wash and purify themselves, and abstain from everything unclean, and put on their festal garments (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>; and comp. <a href="/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>).
