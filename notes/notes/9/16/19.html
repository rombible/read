The Spirit of the Lord departed from him. If God and his grace do not rule us, sin and Satan will have possession of us. The devil, by the Divine permission, troubled and terrified Saul, by the corrupt humours of his body, and passions of his mind. He grew fretful, peevish, and discontented, and at times a madman. It is a pity that music, which may be serviceable to the good temper of the mind, should ever be abused, to support vanity and luxury, and made an occasion of drawing the heart from God and serious things. That is driving away the good Spirit, not the evil spirit. Music, diversions, company, or business, have for a time often been employed to quiet the wounded conscience; but nothing can effect a real cure but the blood of Christ, applied in faith, and the sanctifying Spirit sealing the pardon, by his holy comforts. All other plans to dispel religious melancholy are sure to add to distress, either in this world or the next.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A mighty valiant man ... - David's reputation for courage, skill, discretion, and manly beauty, was already great.

As a great man might not be approached without a present (<a href="/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-4.htm">1 Samuel 10:4</a>), Jesse sends one consisting of produce from his farm.

It was not <span class="cmt_word">an ass laden with bread,</span> as in the A.V., but all three things were placed upon the animal. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David arrived, - and he was ruddy, also of beautiful eyes and good looks (&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, used to denote the reddish colour of the hair, which was regarded as a mark of beauty in southern lands, where the hair is generally black. &#1506;&#1501; is an adverb here  equals  therewith), and therefore, so far as his looks and figure were concerned, well fitted, notwithstanding his youth, for the office to which the Lord had chosen him, since corporeal beauty was one of the outward distinctions of a king, - the Lord pointed him out to the prophet as the chosen one; whereupon he anointed him in the midst of his brethren. Along with the anointing the Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward. But Samuel returned to Ramah when the sacrificial meal was over. There is nothing recorded concerning any words of Samuel to David at the time of the anointing and in explanation of its meaning, as in the case of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). In all probability Samuel said nothing at the time, since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2</a>, he had good reason for keeping the matter secret, not only on his own account, but still more for David's sake; so that even the brethren of David who were present knew nothing about the meaning and object of the anointing, but may have imagined that Samuel merely intended to consecrate David as a pupil of the prophets. At the same time, we can hardly suppose that Samuel left Jesse, and even David, in uncertainty as to the object of his mission, and of the anointing which he had performed. He may have communicated all this to both of them, without letting the other sons know. It by no means follows, that because David remained with his father and kept the sheep as before, therefore his calling to be king must have been unknown to him; but only that in the anointing which he had received he did not discern either the necessity or obligation to appear openly as the anointed of the Lord, and that after receiving the Spirit of the Lord in consequence of the anointing, he left the further development of the matter to the Lord in childlike submission, assured that He would prepare and show him the way to the throne in His own good time. </body></html>
