The vice-gerent on earth of the invisible King could be no arbitrary despot, unless he transgressed plainly and openly the “manner of the kingdom” written in a book, and laid up before the Lord by Samuel.<p>This sacred document, we may assume, contained, too, the exact details of the singular story of the choice of the first king of Israel. It was well, no doubt, thought Samuel, that coming ages should know exactly how it came to pass that he, the seer, anointed the Benjamite of Gibeah as king over the Lord’s inheritance. We may, therefore, fairly conclude that from the record laid up among the sacred archives in the sanctuary, the compiler or redactor of this “Book of Samuel” derived his intimate knowledge of every little fact connected with the Divine choice of Saul.<p>The legal portion of this writing respecting the kingdom was, of course, strictly based upon what Moses had already written on this subject in Deuteronomy (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-14.htm" title="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.">1Samuel 17:14-20</a>).<p>We find here, in this writing of Samuel, the first trace of literary composition among the Israelites since the days of Moses. The great revival in letters which began shortly after the days of Saul was due, most probably, to the influence of Samuel and those great schools of the prophets which he had established in the land.<p><span class= "bld">And laid it up before the Lord.</span>—We are not told where this was done, but the words seem to imply that the document, or roll, was placed by the side of the Ark, then in the “city of woods,” Kiriath-yearim. Josephus says this writing was preserved in the Tabernacle of the Holy of Holies, where the Book of the Law had been laid up (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-26.htm" title="Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And Samuel sent all the people away.</span>—It is noteworthy that even after the formal popular ratification of Saul’s election as king, it is <span class= "ital">Samuel </span>who dismisses the assembly. Indeed, throughout the remainder of the great seer’s life, whenever he appears on the scene, he is evidently the principal person, occupying a position above king or priest. On the other hand, after this period Samuel made but comparatively few public appearances; of his own free will he seems to have retired into privacy, and only in emergencies to have left his retirement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/10-25.htm" title="Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD.

And therefore they came in the beginning of this business, to ask one of his prophet.

So little fond was Saul now of that power, which soon after, when he possessed it, he could not think of parting with, that he hid himself. It is good to be conscious of our unworthiness and insufficiency for the services to which we are called; but men should not go into the contrary extreme, by refusing the employments to which the Lord and the church call them. The greater part of the people treated the matter with indifference. Saul modestly went home to his own house, but was attended by a band of men whose hearts God disposed to support his authority. If the heart bend at any time the right way, it is because He has touched it. One touch is enough when it is Divine. Others despised him. Thus differently are men affected to our exalted Redeemer. There is a remnant who submit to him, and follow him wherever he goes; they are those whose hearts God has touched, whom he has made willing. But there are others who despise him, who ask, How shall this man save us?

Samuel called the people together &#8230; at Mizpeh&#8212;a shaft-like hill near Hebron, five hundred feet in height. The national assemblies of the Israelites were held there. A day having been appointed for the election of a king, Samuel, after having charged the people with a rejection of God's institution and a superseding of it by one of their own, proceeded to the nomination of the new monarch. As it was of the utmost importance that the appointment should be under the divine direction and control, the determination was made by the miraculous lot, tribes, families, and individuals being successively passed until Saul was found. His concealment of himself must have been the result either of innate modesty, or a sudden nervous excitement under the circumstances. When dragged into view, he was seen to possess all those corporeal advantages which a rude people desiderate in their sovereigns; and the exhibition of which gained for the prince the favorable opinion of Samuel also. In the midst of the national enthusiasm, however, the prophet's deep piety and genuine patriotism took care to explain "the manner of the kingdom," that is, the royal rights and privileges, together with the limitations to which they were to be subjected; and in order that the constitution might be ratified with all due solemnity, the charter of this constitutional monarchy was recorded and laid up "before the Lord," that is, deposited in the custody of the priests, along with the most sacred archives of the nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The manner of the kingdom; </span> not the manner of the king, of which he had spoken before, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm" title="And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.">1 Samuel 8:11</a></span>, &c., but of the kingdom: to wit, the laws and rules by which the kingly government was to be managed, agreeable to those mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deu 17:16</a></span>, &c, which peradventure Samuel did expound and apply to their particular case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before the Lord; </span> before the ark, or in the sanctuary, where it was kept safe from depravation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom,  According to Ben Gersom, he laid before them the power a king had over his people, and the punishment he might inflict upon them, if they rebelled against him; and some think this is the same he delivered in <a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10</a> concerning the arbitrary power of their kings, and how they would be used by them; and which he here repeated, and then wrote it, that it might be a testimony against them hereafter; with which what Josephus (m) says pretty much agrees, that in the hearing of the king he foretold what would befall them, and then wrote it, and laid it up, that it might be a witness of his predictions; but that in  <p><a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-17</a>.

The latter class especially, as being the mouthpiece of Jehovah, formed a powerful check upon the development of despotic tendencies. In sketching Saul's kingly rights Samuel would be guided by <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, and would give the king his true position as the representative of Jehovah both in all matters of internal administration and of war. <span class="cmt_word">And laid it up before Jehovah.</span> Probably by the side of the ark. We are not to suppose that Samuel wrote this at Mizpah. He would fully explain to Saul and the people there what a theocratic king ought to be, and would afterwards draw up a formal document both as a memorial of what had been done, and for the use of future sovereigns, and place it within the sanctuary.
