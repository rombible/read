Yet let not an outward show of devotion, and a sudden change for the present, be too much relied on; Saul among the prophets was Saul still. His being anointed was kept private. He leaves it to God to carry on his own work by Samuel, and sits still, to see how the matter will fall.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the order of the narrative, and the mention of Saul's servant, it looks as if Saul found his uncle at the high place.

As he left Samuel early in the morning, Saul could easily reach Gibeah in one day, even if the town where he had met with Samuel was situated to the south-west of Rachel's tomb, as the distance from that tomb to Gibeah was not more than three and a half or four hours.</body></html>
