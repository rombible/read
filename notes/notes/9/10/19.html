So little fond was Saul now of that power, which soon after, when he possessed it, he could not think of parting with, that he hid himself. It is good to be conscious of our unworthiness and insufficiency for the services to which we are called; but men should not go into the contrary extreme, by refusing the employments to which the Lord and the church call them. The greater part of the people treated the matter with indifference. Saul modestly went home to his own house, but was attended by a band of men whose hearts God disposed to support his authority. If the heart bend at any time the right way, it is because He has touched it. One touch is enough when it is Divine. Others despised him. Thus differently are men affected to our exalted Redeemer. There is a remnant who submit to him, and follow him wherever he goes; they are those whose hearts God has touched, whom he has made willing. But there are others who despise him, who ask, How shall this man save us? They are offended in him, and they will be punished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the use of "thousand" as equivalent to "family," see <a href="/1_samuel/23-23.htm">1 Samuel 23:23</a>; <a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a> margin.

Samuel called the people together &#8230; at Mizpeh&#8212;a shaft-like hill near Hebron, five hundred feet in height. The national assemblies of the Israelites were held there. A day having been appointed for the election of a king, Samuel, after having charged the people with a rejection of God's institution and a superseding of it by one of their own, proceeded to the nomination of the new monarch. As it was of the utmost importance that the appointment should be under the divine direction and control, the determination was made by the miraculous lot, tribes, families, and individuals being successively passed until Saul was found. His concealment of himself must have been the result either of innate modesty, or a sudden nervous excitement under the circumstances. When dragged into view, he was seen to possess all those corporeal advantages which a rude people desiderate in their sovereigns; and the exhibition of which gained for the prince the favorable opinion of Samuel also. In the midst of the national enthusiasm, however, the prophet's deep piety and genuine patriotism took care to explain "the manner of the kingdom," that is, the royal rights and privileges, together with the limitations to which they were to be subjected; and in order that the constitution might be ratified with all due solemnity, the charter of this constitutional monarchy was recorded and laid up "before the Lord," that is, deposited in the custody of the priests, along with the most sacred archives of the nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ye have this day rejected your God; </span> you this day declare that you persist in your former act of rejecting God’s government: <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.">1 Samuel 8:7</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who himself saved you; </span> who by his own special providence took care to raise up judges and saviours for you, and to deliver you at all times, when you needed his help, and did not by your sins obstruct it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye have said unto him, </span> i.e. unto me his prophet and ambassador; and consequently unto the Lord, whom I represented, and in whose name I spake and acted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By your tribes, and by your thousands; </span> for each tribe was divided into thousands, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/10-36.htm" title="And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.">Numbers 10:36</a> <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm" title="His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.">Deu 33:17</a> <a href="/joshua/22-14.htm" title="And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.">Joshua 22:14</a>,21 Mic 5:2</span>, as in England counties are into hundreds. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ye have this day rejected your God,....

But he did not relate the words which had been spoken by Samuel concerning the monarchy, from unambitious humility (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/10-23.htm">1 Samuel 10:23</a>) and not because he was afraid of unbelief and envy, as Thenius follows Josephus in supposing. From the expression "he came to Bamah" (Eng. ver. "to the high place"), we must conclude, that not only Saul's uncle, but his father also, lived in Bamah, as we find Saul immediately afterwards in his own family circle (see <a href="/1_samuel/10-14.htm">1 Samuel 10:14</a>.). </body></html>
