For Saul's further satisfaction, Samuel gives him some signs which should come to pass the same day. The first place he directs him to, was the sepulchre of one of his ancestors; there he must be reminded of his own mortality, and now that he had a crown before him, must think of his grave, in which all his honour would be laid in the dust. From the time of Samuel there appears to have been schools, or places where pious young men were brought up in the knowledge of Divine things. Saul should find himself strongly moved to join with them, and should be turned into another man from what he had been. The Spirit of God changes men, wonderfully transforms them. Saul, by praising God in the communion of saints, became another man, but it may be questioned if he became a new man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will come upon thee - The word rendered "come," means to "come" or "pass upon," as fire does when it breaks out and spreads <a href="/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6</a>; hence, it is frequently used of the Spirit of God passing upon anyone.

It describes the change in point of mental power and energy which would result from the influx of the Spirit of the Lord <a href="/1_samuel/10-9.htm">1 Samuel 10:9</a>. In the case of Samson it was a supernatural bodily strength; in the case of Saul a capacity for ruling and leading the people of which before he was destitute, and which the Spirit worked in him.

Anointing with oil as a symbol of endowment with the Spirit of God; as the oil itself, by virtue of the strength which it gives to the vital spirits, was a symbol of the Spirit of God as the principle of divine and spiritual power (see at <a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>). Hitherto there had been no other anointing among the people of God than that of the priests and sanctuary (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>.; <a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>.). When Saul, therefore, was consecrated as king by anointing, the monarchy was inaugurated as a divine institution, standing on a par with the priesthood; through which henceforth the Lord would also bestow upon His people the gifts of His Spirit for the building up of His kingdom. As the priests were consecrated by anointing to be the media of the ethical blessings of divine grace for Israel, so the king was consecrated by anointing to be the vehicle and medium of all the blessings of grace which the Lord, as the God-king, would confer upon His people through the institution of a civil government. Through this anointing, which was performed by Samuel under the direction of God, the king was set apart from the rest of the nation as "anointed of the Lord" (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-5.htm">1 Samuel 12:5</a>, etc.), and sanctified as the &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, i.e., its captain, its leader and commander. Kissing was probably not a sign of homage or reverence towards the anointed of the Lord, so much as "a kiss of affection, with which the grace of God itself was sealed" (Seb. Schmidt).<p>(Note: The lxx and Vulgate have expanded the second half of this verse by a considerable addition, which reads as follows in the lxx: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;. And in the Vulgate: Ecce, unxit te Dominus super haereditatem suam in principem, et liberabis populum suum de manibus inimicorum ejus, qui in circuitu ejus sunt. Et hoc tibi signum, quia unxit te Deus in principem. A comparison of these two texts will show that the lxx interpolated their addition between &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, as the last clause, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, is a verbal translation of &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;. In the Vulgate, on the other hand, the first clause, ecce unxit - in principem, corresponds word for word with the Hebrew text, from which we may see that Jerome translated our present Hebrew text; and the addition, et liberabis, etc., was interpolated into the Vulgate from the Itala. The text of the Septuagint is nothing more than a gloss formed from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16-17</a>, which the translator thought necessary, partly because he could not clearly see the force of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, but more especially because he could not explain the fact that Samuel speaks to Saul of signs, without having announced them to him as such. But the author of the gloss has overlooked the fact that Samuel does not give Saul a &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, but three &#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;, and describes the object of them in <a href="/1_samuel/10-7.htm">1 Samuel 10:7</a> as being the following, namely, that Saul would learn when they took place what he had to do, for Jehovah was with him, and not that they would prove that the Lord had anointed him to be captain.) </body></html>
