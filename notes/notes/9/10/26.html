We may conclude that his fellow citizens, proud of the honour conferred on one of themselves, were among his earliest devoted attendants.

The highest prudence and sagacity marked all the early period of the reign of the first king. Slow to take offence, we shall see from the next verse how Saul and his valiant adherents busied themselves in conciliating the disaffected, and in preparing for a decisive action against the enemies who were on all sides harrying the land. An opportunity (see the history in the next chapter) soon presented itself of showing that the choice of a king had been wisely made.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm" title="And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.">1 Samuel 10:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">Saul went home to Gibeah — </span>Not being actually inaugurated into his kingdom, he thought fit to retire to his former habitation, and to live privately till he had an occasion to show himself in a more illustrious manner. <span class="ital">There went with him a band of men — </span>A company, probably, of stout, valiant men, of great resolution, who went as his guard, to afford him safe and honourable conduct to his house, although, as it appears, not to abide with him there, which would not have suited his present circumstances. <span class="ital">Whose hearts God had touched — </span>Who were moved by a divine influence to do their duty in this instance.

So little fond was Saul now of that power, which soon after, when he possessed it, he could not think of parting with, that he hid himself. It is good to be conscious of our unworthiness and insufficiency for the services to which we are called; but men should not go into the contrary extreme, by refusing the employments to which the Lord and the church call them. The greater part of the people treated the matter with indifference. Saul modestly went home to his own house, but was attended by a band of men whose hearts God disposed to support his authority. If the heart bend at any time the right way, it is because He has touched it. One touch is enough when it is Divine. Others despised him. Thus differently are men affected to our exalted Redeemer. There is a remnant who submit to him, and follow him wherever he goes; they are those whose hearts God has touched, whom he has made willing. But there are others who despise him, who ask, How shall this man save us?

These, though they did not desire a king, as the generality of the people did, yet when God had given them a king, they were most forward to pay him that reverence and obedience which they owed him; both which proceeded from the same principle, that they were in both cases guided by God’s will; which was, that they should not desire a king in their circumstances; and yet they should obey him, when God had set a king over them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Saul also went home to Gibeah,....

The Septuagint, on the contrary, strengthens it by rendering "sons of strength" and "pestilent sons." As there was a garrison in the district of Gibeah, this proceeding was likely to embroil Saul with the Philistines, and probably was so intended. They <span class="cmt_word">brought him no presents</span>. Apparently, therefore, the people did bring him presents; and as these would chiefly consist of food, they would be useful only for maintaining a body  of men. This, too, would scarcely escape the notice of so watchful an enemy, and yet until Saul smote one of their garrisons they did nothing; but then, forthwith, they invaded Israel so promptly, and with such overwhelming numbers, as seems to prove that they had been busily making preparations meanwhile to maintain their empire. <span class="cmt_word">He held his peace.</span> Literally, "was as one that is deaf." Had Saul not controlled his anger, a civil war would have been the result, and the lordly tribes of Ephraim and Judah might have refused a king chosen from the little tribe of Benjamin. In fact, Judah never does seem to have given a hearty allegiance to Saul. The Septuagint, followed by Josephus, offers a not improbable different reading, which involves but a very slight change in the Hebrew. Uniting the words with the next chapter, they translate, "And it came to pass, after about a month, that Nahash the Ammonite," etc. The Vulgate has both readings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this warning, Samuel directed the assembled Israelites to come before Jehovah (i.e., before the altar of Jehovah which stood at Mizpeh, according to <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>) according to their tribes and families (alaphim: see at <a href="/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>); "and there was taken (by lot) the tribe of Benjamin." &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;, lit. to be snatched out by Jehovah, namely, through the lot (see <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14</a>, <a href="/joshua/7-16.htm">Joshua 7:16</a>). He then directed the tribe of Benjamin to draw near according to its families, i.e., he directed the heads of the families of this tribe to come before the altar of the Lord and draw lots; and the family of Matri was taken. Lastly, when the heads of the households in this family came, and after that the different individuals in the household which had been taken, the lot fell upon Saul the son of Kish. In the words, "Saul the son of Kish was taken," the historian proceeds at once to the final result of the casting of the lots, without describing the intermediate steps any further.<p>(Note: It is true the Septuagint introduces the words &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; before &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1499;&#1491;, and this clause is also found in a very recent Hebrew MS (viz., 451 in Kennicott's dissert. gener. p. 491). But it is very evident that these words did not form an integral part of the original text, as Thenius supposes, but were nothing more than an interpolation of the Sept. translators, from the simple fact that they do not fill up the supposed gap at all completely, but only in a very partial and in fact a very mistaken manner; for the family of Matri could not come to the lot &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (man by man), but only &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (by households: <a href="/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14</a>). Before the household (beth-aboth, father's house) of Saul could be taken, it was necessary that the &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), i.e., the different heads of households, should be brought; and it was not till then that Kish, or his son Saul, could be singled out as the appointed of the Lord. Neither the author of the gloss in the lxx, nor the modern defender of the gloss, has thought of this.)<p>When the lot fell upon Saul, they sought him, and he could not be found.</body></html>
