In composing this history of the events which led to the elevation of Samuel to the judgeship, he simply puts together the materials he possessed of the records of these days, and gives us a vivid picture of the calamities of the rule of Eli. As he never spares his weakness, or attempts to veil his blind nepotism, we feel here the perfect truth of this touching incident which closed the old man’s life. He loved the Ark, because of its close connection with his God, better, after all, than his two sons. We have seen already that he could bear the stern announcement of the ruin and degradation of the fortune of his proud house, for which he toiled only too faithfully; he could bear to see another—the boy Samuel—preferred before him, the high priest and judge of Israel; he could endure to hear of the defeat and ruin of the country over which he had so long ruled, and which he loved so well; even the news of the death of his sons he could listen to with sad resignation; but when his ears caught the words “the ark of God is taken,” the old man s heart broke, and he died. The chronicler of this period, who certainly never favoured Eli, leaves upon us the impression that with all his faults and imperfections he was still a servant of God. Wordsworth quotes here <a href="/context/psalms/137-5.htm" title="If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.">Psalm 137:5-6</a> : “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <span class= "ital">her cunning. </span>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: <span class= "ital">if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.”</span>—The dying words of Archbishop Whitgift were, “<span class= "ital">Pro ecclesils Dei,”—“</span>For the church of God.”<p><span class= "bld">And he had judged Israel forty years.</span>—“When I read of Eli the priest, of the sons of Aaron, judging Israel forty years, and of Samuel, certainly a Levite, though not a priest, going circuit as a judge itinerant in Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.">1Samuel 7:16</a>), and of others of the families of Levi appointed by King David to be judges and officers, not only in all the business of the Lord, but also for the outward business of Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/15-35.htm" title="And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.">2Samuel 15:35</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-29.htm" title="Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.">1Chronicles 26:29-32</a>)—when I observe in the Church stories, ever since the world had Christian princes, how ecclesiastical persons have been employed by their sovereigns in their weightiest consultations and affairs of state, I cannot but wonder at those who inveigh against courts, power, jurisdiction, and the temporalities of bishops and other ecclesiastical persons. I speak it not to justify abuses of men, but to justify the lawfulness of the tiling.”—Bishop Sanderson, quoted by Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_samuel/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_samuel/4-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy.

So fell the crown from his head, when he had judged Israel forty years: thus did his sun set under a cloud. Thus was the wickedness of those sons of his, whom he had indulged, his ruin. Thus does God sometimes set marks of his displeasure on good men, that others may hear and fear. Yet we must observe, it was the loss of the ark that was his death, and not the slaughter of his sons. He says, in effect, Let me fall with the ark! Who can live when the ordinances of God are removed?

And when the messenger concluded his story with, The ark of God is taken, he is struck to the heart, and died immediately. A man may die miserably, yet not die eternally; may come to an untimely end, yet the end be peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A comparison of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-4.htm">2 Samuel 18:4</a>, explains exactly the meaning of the "side of the gate," and Eli's position. His seat or throne, without a back, stood with the side against the jamb of the gate, leaving the passage through the gate quite clear, but placed so that every one passing through the gate must pass in front of him.<p>Forty years - This chronological note connects this book with that of Judges. (Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>, etc.) It is an interesting question, but one very difficult to answer how near to the death of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the High Priest, Eli's forty years of judgeship bring him. It is probable that at least one high priesthood intervened. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-18. Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside&#8212;The aged priest, as a public magistrate, used, in dispensing justice, to seat himself daily in a spacious recess at the entrance gate of the city. In his intense anxiety to learn the issue of the battle, he took up his usual place as the most convenient for meeting with passers-by. His seat was an official chair, similar to those of the ancient Egyptian judges, richly carved, superbly ornamented, high, and without a back. The calamities announced to Samuel as about to fall upon the family of Eli [1Sa 2:34] were now inflicted in the death of his two sons, and after his death, by that of his daughter-in-law, whose infant son received a name that perpetuated the fallen glory of the church and nation [1Sa 4:19-22]. The public disaster was completed by the capture of the ark. Poor Eli! He was a good man, in spite of his unhappy weaknesses. So strongly were his sensibilities enlisted on the side of religion, that the news of the capture of the ark proved to him a knell of death; and yet his overindulgence, or sad neglect of his family&#8212;the main cause of all the evils that led to its fall&#8212;has been recorded, as a beacon to warn all heads of Christian families against making shipwreck on the same rock.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He fell from off the seat backward; </span> being so oppressed with grief and astonishment, that he had no strength left to support him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By the side of the gate, </span> to wit, the gate of the city, which was most convenient for the speedy understanding of all occurrences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He was an old man, and heavy; </span> old, and therefore weak, and apt to fall; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">heavy, </span> and therefore his fall more dangerous and pernicious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He had judged Israel; </span> he was their supreme governor, both in civils and spirituals. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,.... Of the taking of that, it struck him to the heart, and killed him; the rest he bore tolerably well, the flight of Israel before the Philistines, the great slaughter made of them, the death of his two sons; but the taking of the ark was so dreadful to him, that he could not support under it: <p>that he fell from off the seat backward, by the side of the gate; which confirms the sense of <a href="/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13</a> though whether it was the gate of his own house, or of the tabernacle, or of the city is not certain; the latter is most probable: it seems the seat on which he sat had no back to it, and might be placed only for present convenience: <p>and his neck brake; the back part of it, the "vertebrae" of it, which has its name in Hebrew from the several joints in it: <p>and he died; not through the breaking of his neck, for it is very probable he died directly upon hearing the ark was taken, and which was the reason of his falling backward, and that brake his neck: <p>for he was an old man, and heavy; full of flesh, a very fat man, and so fell heavy, which occasioned the breaking of his neck: <p>and he had judged Israel forty years; had governed them in the capacity both of an high priest and judge, so that he must enter on his government when fifty eight years of age; the Septuagint version has it very wrongly twenty years.

At these tidings the whole city cried out with terror, so that Eli heard the sound of the cry, and asked the reason of this loud noise (or tumult), whilst the messenger was hurrying towards him with the news. </body></html>
