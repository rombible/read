Sin, the accursed thing, was in the camp, and gave their enemies all the advantage they could wish for. They own the hand of God in their trouble; but, instead of submitting, they speak angrily, as not aware of any just provocation they had given him. The foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart frets against the Lord, Pr 19:3, and finds fault with him. They supposed that they could oblige God to appear for them, by bringing the ark into their camp. Those who have gone back in the life of religion, sometimes discover great fondness for the outward observances of it, as if those would save them; and as if the ark, God's throne, in the camp, would bring them to heaven, though the world and the flesh are on the throne in the heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_samuel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people sent - The expression is very indicative of the political state so frequently noted by the writer of the Book of Judges, "In those days there was no king in Israel." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_samuel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-9. Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us&#8212;Strange that they were so blind to the real cause of the disaster and that they did not discern, in the great and general corruption of religion and morals (1Sa 2:22-25; 7:3; Ps 78:58), the reason why the presence and aid of God were not extended to them. Their first measure for restoring the national spirit and energy ought to have been a complete reformation&#8212;a universal return to purity of worship and morals. But, instead of cherishing a spirit of deep humiliation and sincere repentance, instead of resolving on the abolition of existing abuses, and the re-establishing of the pure faith, they adopted what appeared an easier and speedier course&#8212;they put their trust in ceremonial observances, and doubted not but that the introduction of the ark into the battlefield would ensure their victory. In recommending this extraordinary step, the elders might recollect the confidence it imparted to their ancestors (Nu 10:35; 14:44), as well as what had been done at Jericho. But it is more probable that they were influenced by the heathenish ideas of their idolatrous neighbors, who carried their idol Dagon, or his sacred symbols, to their wars, believing that the power of their divinities was inseparably associated with, or residing in, their images. In short, the shout raised in the Hebrew camp, on the arrival of the ark, indicated very plainly the prevalence among the Israelites at this time of a belief in national deities&#8212;whose influence was local, and whose interest was especially exerted in behalf of the people who adored them. The joy of the Israelites was an emotion springing out of the same superstitious sentiments as the corresponding dismay of their enemies; and to afford them a convincing, though painful proof of their error, was the ulterior object of the discipline to which they were now subjected&#8212;a discipline by which God, while punishing them for their apostasy by allowing the capture of the ark, had another end in view&#8212;that of signally vindicating His supremacy over all the gods of the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_samuel/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That they might bring from thence the ark; </span> which it may seem they should not have done without asking counsel of God, which they might easily have done by Samuel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hophni and Phinehas were there; </span> either, first, in the camp; or rather, secondly, in Shiloh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With the ark; </span> attending upon it, instead of their aged father. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_samuel/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So the people sent to Shiloh,....

The idea is not that of Jehovah's habitation, but of his seat in state as Israel's King.

Levites may have carried it, and priests with the Urim and Thummim have had the charge of every detail. But there was the ill-omened conjuncture of personal immorality with superstitious reverence for mere material symbols, and thereby the presence of the ark only insured, in the moral government of God, Israel's defeat. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/1_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Thus Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground, i.e., left no word unfulfilled which He spoke through Samuel.

By this all Israel from Dan to Beersheba (see at <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>) perceived that Samuel was found trustworthy, or approved (see <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) as a prophet of Jehovah. And the Lord continued to appear at Shiloh; for He revealed himself there to Samuel "in the word of Jehovah," i.e., through a prophetic announcement of His word. These three verses form the transition from the call of Samuel to the following account of his prophetic labours in Israel. At the close of <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-21.htm">1 Samuel 3:21</a>, the lxx have appended a general remark concerning Eli and his sons, which, regarded as a deduction from the context, answers no doubt to the paraphrastic treatment of our book in that version, but in a critical aspect is utterly worthless. </body></html>
