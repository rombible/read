Ruth was pleased with what she gained by her own industry, and was careful to secure it. Let us thus take care that we lose not those things which we have wrought, which we have gained for our souls' good, 2Jo 1:8. Parents should examine their children, as Naomi did, not to frighten or discourage them, so as to make them hate home, or tempt them to tell a lie; but to commend them if they have done well, and with mildness to reprove and caution them if they have done otherwise. It is a good question for us to ask ourselves every night, Where have I gleaned to-day? What improvement have I made in knowledge and grace? What have I done that will turn to a good account? When the Lord deals bountifully with us, let us not be found in any other field, nor seeking for happiness and satisfaction in the creature. We lose Divine favours, if we slight them. Ruth dutifully observed her mother's directions. And when the harvest was ended, she kept her aged mother company at home. Dinah went out to see the daughters of the land; her vanity ended in disgrace, Ge 34. Ruth kept at home, and helped to maintain her mother, and went out on no other errand than to get provision for her; her humility and industry ended in preferment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And beat out that she had gleaned - Namely, with a stick, as the word implies (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/24-20.htm">Deuteronomy 24:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>).

"The Lord recompense thy work, and let thy reward be perfect (recalling <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>) from the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou hast come to seek refuge under His wings!" For this figurative expression, which is derived from <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, compare <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>. In these words of Boaz we see the genuine piety of a true Israelite. </body></html>
