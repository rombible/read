Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She fell on her face - With Oriental reverence (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/33-3.htm">Genesis 33:3</a>, and the marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ruth/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn&#8212;Gleaners were sometimes allowed, by kind and charitable masters, to partake of the refreshments provided for the reapers.

It was what was undermost as she bowed herself, so that the pressure of the sum-total of the body fell on it as she gracefully stooped. <span class="cmt_word">And prostrated herself to the ground.</span> Thus completing, and doubtless in no sprawling or clumsy way, her respectful obeisance.

But, with equal gratitude and felicity, she specifies not the culminating acts of kindness, but the very first step that her benefactor had taken. He began by <span class="accented">taking notice</span> of her.

It is evident from this answer of the servant who was placed over the reapers, (1) that Boaz did not prohibit any poor person from gleaning in his field; (2) that Ruth asked permission of the overseer of the reapers, and availed herself of this permission with untiring zeal from the first thing in the morning, that she might get the necessary support for her mother-in-law and herself; and (3) that her history was well known to the overseer, and also to Boaz, although Boaz saw her now for the first time. </body></html>
