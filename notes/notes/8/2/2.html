She does not hesitate to face the hard work necessary on her mother-in-law’s account; nor is she too proud to condescend to a work which might perhaps seem humiliating. Nor does one hanker after her old home in the land of Moab and the plenty there. Energy, honesty of purpose, and loyalty are alike evinced here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ruth/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ruth/2-2.htm" title="And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace.

When Providence had made her poor, she cheerfully stoops to her lot. High spirits will rather starve than stoop; not so Ruth. Nay, it is her own proposal. She speaks humbly in her expectation of leave to glean. We may not demand kindness as a debt, but ask, and take it as a favour, though in a small matter. Ruth also was an example of industry. She loved not to eat the bread of idleness. This is an example to young people. Diligence promises well, both for this world and the other. We must not be shy of any honest employment. No labour is a reproach. Sin is a thing below us, but we must not think any thing else so, to which Providence call us. She was an example of regard to her mother, and of trust in Providence. God wisely orders what seem to us small events; and those that appear altogether uncertain, still are directed to serve his own glory, and the good of his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A kinsman - More literally "an acquaintance"; here (and in the feminine, <a href="/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2</a>) denoting the person with whom one is intimately acquainted, one's near relation.

After they had been some little time at Bethlehem, and not long; for they came at the beginning of barley harvest, and as yet it was not over, nor perhaps for some time after this; and knowing and considering the circumstances they were in, and unwilling to live an idle life, and ready to do any thing for the support of her life, and of her ancient mother-in-law; which was very commendable, and showed her to be an industrious virtuous woman: she addressed her, and said: <p>let me now go to the field; she did not choose to go any where, nor do anything, without her advice and consent; so dutiful and obedient was she to her, and so high an opinion had she of her wisdom and goodness; she desired to go to the field which belonged to Bethlehem, which seems to have been an open field, not enclosed, where each inhabitant had his part, as Boaz, <a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a> though Jarchi interprets it of one of the fields of the men of the city; hither she asked leave to go, not with any ill intent, nor was she in any danger of being exposed, since it being harvest time the field was full of people: her end in going thither is expressed in the next clause: <p>and glean ears of corn after him, in whose sight I shall find grace; or "in" or "among the ears of corn" (o); between the ears of corn bound up into sheaves, and there pick up the loose ears that were dropped and left. This she proposed to do with the leave of the owner of the field, or of the reapers, whom she followed; she might be ignorant that it was allowed by the law of God that widows and strangers might glean in the field, <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a> or if she had been acquainted with it by Naomi, which is not improbable, such was her modesty and humility, that she did not choose to make use of this privilege without leave; lest, as Jarchi says, she should be chided or reproved, and it is certain she did entreat the favour to glean, <a href="/ruth/2-7.htm">Ruth 2:7</a>. <p>and she said unto her, go, my daughter; which shows the necessitous circumstances Naomi was in; though perhaps she might give this leave and direction under an impulse of the Spirit of God, in order to bring about an event of the greatest moment and importance, whereby she became the ancestor of our blessed Lord. <p>(o)  , Sept.

Permission to glean in the harvest field was allowed to the poor, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow; naturally it depended on the goodwill of the owner; see <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm" title="When you cut down your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>, <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.">Leviticus 19:9</a> f., <a href="/leviticus/23-22.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not make clean riddance of the corners of your field when you reap, neither shall you gather any gleaning of your harvest: you shall leave them to the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 23:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me go, I pray thee, to the cornfields, that I may glean among the ears after whosoever shall show me favor.</span> In modern style one would not, in referring, at this stage of the narrative, to Ruth, deem it in the least degree necessary or advantageous to repeat the designation "the Moabitess." The repetition is antique, and calls to mind the redundant particularization of legal phraseology - "the aforesaid Ruth, the Moabitess." She was willing and wishful to avail herself of an Israelitish privilege accorded to the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-22.htm">Leviticus 23:22</a>: <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>). Such gleaning was a humiliation to those who had been accustomed to give rather than to get. But Ruth saw, in the pinched features of her mother-in-law, that there was now a serious difficulty in keeping the wolf outside the door. And hence, although there would be temptation in the step, as well as humiliation, she resolved to avail herself of the harvest season to gather as large a store as possible of those nutritious cereals which form the staff of life, and which they would grind for themselves in their little handmill or quern. She said, with beautiful courtesy. "<span class="accented">Let</span> me go I, pray, thee;" or, "<span class="accented">I</span> wish to go, if you will please to allow me." Such is the force of the peculiar Hebrew idiom. "<span class="accented">There is</span> no place," says Lawson, "where our tongues ought to be better governed than in our own houses." <span class="cmt_word">To the cornfields.</span> Very literally, "<span class="accented">to</span> the field." It is the language of townspeople, when referring to the land round about the town that was kept under tillage. It was not customary to separate cornfield from  cornfield by means of walls and hedges. A simple furrow, with perhaps a stone here and there, or a small collection of stones, sufficed, as in Switzerland at the present day, to distinguish the patches or portions that belonged to different proprietors. Hence the singular word <span class="accented">field</span>, as comprehending the sum-total of the adjoining unenclosed ground that had been laid down in grain. "Though the gardens and vineyards," says Horatio B. Hackett, "are usually surrounded by a stone wall or hedge of prickly pear, the grain-fields, on the contrary, though they belong to different proprietors, are not separated by any enclosure from each other. The boundary between them is indicated by heaps of small stones, or sometimes by single upright stones, placed at intervals of a rod or more from each other. This is the ancient landmark of which we read in the Old Testament" ('Illustrations of Scripture,' p. 110). The <span class="accented">word field in</span> Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, denotes radically, not so much <span class="accented">plain</span>, as <span class="accented">ploughed</span> land (see Raabe's 'Glosser'). In English there is a slightly varied though corresponding idiom lying at the base of the Teutonic term in use. A <span class="accented">field</span> (German <span class="accented">Fold</span>) is a <span class="accented">clearance</span>, a place where the trees of the original forest have been <span class="accented">felled</span>. The expression, <span class="cmt_word">that I may glean 'among' the ears,</span> proceeds on the assumption that Ruth did not expect that she would "make a clean sweep" of all the straggled ears. There might likely be other gleaners besides herself, and even though there should not, she could not expect to gather all. <span class="cmt_word">After whosoever shall show me favor.</span> A peculiarly antique kind of structure in the original: "after whom I shall find favor in his eyes." Ruth speaks as if she thought only of one reaper, and he the proprietor. She, as it were, instinctively conceives of the laborers as "hands." <span class="cmt_word">And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</span> Naomi yielded; no doubt at first reluctantly, yet no doubt also in a spirit of grateful admiration of her daughter-in-law, who, when she could hot lift up her circumstances to her mind, brought down her mind to her circumstances <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As she insisted strongly upon going with her (&#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1509;, to stiffen one's self firmly upon a thing), Naomi gave up persuading her any more to return. </body></html>
