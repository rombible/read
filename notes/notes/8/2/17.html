Ruth was pleased with what she gained by her own industry, and was careful to secure it. Let us thus take care that we lose not those things which we have wrought, which we have gained for our souls' good, 2Jo 1:8. Parents should examine their children, as Naomi did, not to frighten or discourage them, so as to make them hate home, or tempt them to tell a lie; but to commend them if they have done well, and with mildness to reprove and caution them if they have done otherwise. It is a good question for us to ask ourselves every night, Where have I gleaned to-day? What improvement have I made in knowledge and grace? What have I done that will turn to a good account? When the Lord deals bountifully with us, let us not be found in any other field, nor seeking for happiness and satisfaction in the creature. We lose Divine favours, if we slight them. Ruth dutifully observed her mother's directions. And when the harvest was ended, she kept her aged mother company at home. Dinah went out to see the daughters of the land; her vanity ended in disgrace, Ge 34. Ruth kept at home, and helped to maintain her mother, and went out on no other errand than to get provision for her; her humility and industry ended in preferment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And beat out that she had gleaned - Namely, with a stick, as the word implies (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/24-20.htm">Deuteronomy 24:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>).

An instance of her great diligence and industry, attending to this mean employment constantly from morning tonight: <p>and beat out that she had gleaned: she did not bind up her gleanings in a bundle, and carry it home on her head, as gleaners with us do, but she beat it out with a staff in the field, where she gleaned it, and winnowed it, very probably in the threshingfloor of Boaz; by which means what she had gleaned was brought into a lesser size and weight, and was a lighter burden to carry home: <p>and it was an ephah of barley; or three seahs of barley, as the Targum; which, according to Bishop Cumberland (i), was six gallons, and three pints, and three solid inches: an omer is said to be the tenth part of an ephah, and, made into bread, was as much as a man could eat in one day, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>, so that Ruth got enough in one day, for herself and her mother-in-law, which would last five days at least. This was a great deal for one woman to pick up, ear by ear, in one day; and must be accounted for, not only by her diligence and industry, but by the favour shown her by the reapers, under the direction of Boaz, who suffered her to glean among the sheaves, and let fall handfuls for her to pick up. <p>(i) Of Scripture Weights and Measures, ch. 3. p. 64. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ruth/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">she beat out</span>] Cf. <a href="/judges/6-11.htm" title="And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.">Jdg 6:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an ephah</span>] Approximately equivalent to our bushel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she gleaned in the field until the evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</span> Gathering together her various sheaves, lots, or bundles (see ver. 7), she threshed them with some suitable rod or simple 'flail' (<span class="accented">flagellum</span>), which she had either brought with her in the morning, as part of her equipment as a gleaner, or had obtained at the hut; or perhaps, like many others, she would make use of a convenient stone. Speaking of the village of Huj, near Gaza, Robinson says, "We found the lazy inhabitants still engaged in treading out the barley harvest, which their neighbors had completed long before. <span class="accented">Several women were beating out with a stick handfuls of the grain which they seemed to have gleaned</span>. One female was grinding with a hand mill, turning the mill with one hand, and occasionally dropping in the grain with the other" ('Researches,' vol. 2. p. 385). "In the evening," says Dr. W. M. Thomson, "you might see some poor woman or maiden, that had been permitted to glean on her own account, sitting by the roadside, and beating out with a stick or a stone what she had gathered, as Ruth did. I have often watched this process in various parts of the country" ('The Land and the, Book,' p. 647). The diligent gleaner on Boaz's field found, after threshing, that she had nearly an ephah of barley. It would be a considerable load for a female to curry - about a bushel. Josephus mentions incidentally, in his ' Antiquities' (15:9, 2), that the Hebrew <span class="accented">cot</span> or <span class="accented">homer</span> was equivalent to ten Attic <span class="accented">me>dimnoi</span>. But as the ephah was exactly the tenth part of a cor or homer, it follows that the Hebrew  ephah was equivalent to the Attic <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Moreover, just as the ephah was the tenth part of a homer, so the omer was the tenth part of an ephah (<a href="/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>); and thus, if an omer of barley would be somewhat equivalent for nutritive purposes to an omer of manna, it would be a sufficient daily allowance for a man (see <a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>). Hence Ruth would take home with her what would suffice for several days' sustenance to Naomi and herself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:18-23. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Boaz replied, "Everything has been told me that thou hast done to (&#1488;&#1514;, prep. as in <a href="/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-17.htm">2 Samuel 16:17</a>) thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband, that thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and thy kindred, and hast come to a people that thou knewest not heretofore" (hast therefore done what God commanded Abraham to do, <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). "The Lord recompense thy work, and let thy reward be perfect (recalling <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>) from the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou hast come to seek refuge under His wings!"

In these words of Boaz we see the genuine piety of a true Israelite. </body></html>
