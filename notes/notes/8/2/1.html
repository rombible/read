When Providence had made her poor, she cheerfully stoops to her lot. High spirits will rather starve than stoop; not so Ruth. Nay, it is her own proposal. She speaks humbly in her expectation of leave to glean. We may not demand kindness as a debt, but ask, and take it as a favour, though in a small matter. Ruth also was an example of industry. She loved not to eat the bread of idleness. This is an example to young people. Diligence promises well, both for this world and the other. We must not be shy of any honest employment. No labour is a reproach. Sin is a thing below us, but we must not think any thing else so, to which Providence call us. She was an example of regard to her mother, and of trust in Providence. God wisely orders what seem to us small events; and those that appear altogether uncertain, still are directed to serve his own glory, and the good of his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A kinsman - More literally "an acquaintance"; here (and in the feminine, <a href="/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2</a>) denoting the person with whom one is intimately acquainted, one's near relation.

That was her kinsman by her husband's side, who now lived at Bethlehem; and yet it does not appear that Naomi made any application to him for assistance in her circumstances, though well known to her, as the word used signifies; which might arise from her modesty, and being loath to be troublesome to him, especially as he was a relation, not of her own family, but of her husband's; but, what is more strange, that this kinsman had taken no notice of her, nor sent to her, who yet was a very generous and liberal man, and had knowledge of her coming, for he had heard of the character of Ruth, <a href="/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a> but perhaps he was not acquainted with their indigent circumstances: <p>a mighty man of wealth; a man of great wealth and riches, and of great power and authority, which riches give and raise a man to, and also of great virtue and honour, all which the word "wealth" signifies; to which may be added the paraphrase the Targumist gives, that he was mighty in the law; in the Scriptures, in the word of God, a truly religious man, which completes his character: <p>of the family of Elimelech; the husband of Naomi; some say that his father was Elimelech's brother; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2</a>, <p>and his name was Boaz; which signifies, "in him is strength", strength of riches, power, virtue, and grace; it is the name of one of the pillars in Solomon's temple, so called from its strength. This man is commonly said by the Jews to be the same with Ibzan, a judge of Israel, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/12-8.htm">Judges 12:8</a>, he was the grandson of Nahshon, prince of the tribe of Judah, who first offered at the dedication of the altar, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>, his father's name was Salmon, and his mother was Rahab, the harlot of Jericho, <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>.

But <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;</span> is ambiguous in import. It primarily means <span class="accented">known</span>, <span class="accented">well-known</span>, <span class="accented">acquainted</span>, <span class="accented">an acquaintance</span> (see <a href="/job/19-14.htm">Job 19:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-13.htm">Psalm 55:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-8.htm">Psalm 88:8, 18</a>). But as intimate acquaintances, especially in a primitive and comparatively unwelded state of society, are generally found within the circle of kinsfolk, the word may be used, and is here used, in reference to a <span class="accented">kinsman</span>. The Vulgate translates it <span class="accented">consanguineus</span>. The translation is interpretatively correct; but the original term is less definite, and hence, in virtue of the ambiguity, there is not absolute redundancy in the appended clause, <span class="accented">of the family</span> or <span class="accented">elan of Elimelech</span>. This friend of Naomi on her husband s side is said, in King James's version, to be <span class="cmt_word">a mighty man of wealth.</span> But the expression so rendered has, in the very numerous passages in which it occurs, a conventional import that stretches out in a different and nobler direction. It is the expression that is so frequently translated "<span class="accented">a</span> mighty man of valor (see <a href="/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>; <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>, etc.). In only one other passage is it rendered as it is by King James's translators in the passage before us, viz., in <a href="/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>. There it is correctly so translated, interpretatively. Here there seems to be a leaning in the same direction, and yet it is not strongly pronounced. Cassel, however, takes the other cue, and translates "a valiant hero "Probably," says he "he had distinguished himself in the conflicts of Israel with their enemies." The expression originally means "strong in strength" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">Sept</span>.), but is ambiguous in consequence of the many-sided import of the latter word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which means originally, either <span class="accented">strength</span>, and then <span class="accented">valor</span>; or, <span class="accented">clannish following</span> (see Raabe), and then <span class="accented">military host</span>, or <span class="accented">force</span>, or <span class="accented">forces</span>; also, <span class="accented">faculty</span> or <span class="accented">ability</span>, and then, as so often "answering all things," <span class="accented">riches</span> or <span class="accented">wealth</span>. The idea the writer seems to be that the friend of the widow's husband <span class="accented">was a strong and substantial yeoman</span>. He was <span class="cmt_word">of the family or clan of Elimelech.</span> The word <span class="accented">family</span> is conventionally too narrow, and the word <span class="accented">elan</span> too broad, to represent the import of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> as here used. The idea intended lies somewhere between. <span class="cmt_word">And his name was Boaz.</span> The root of this name is not found, apparently, in Hebrew, as was supposed by the older philologists, and hence its essential idea is as yet undetermined. Raabe finds its original form in the Sanscrit <span class="accented">bhuvanti</span>, which yields the idea of <span class="accented">prosperousness</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To the repeated entreaty of Naomi that she would follow her sister-in-law and return to her people and her God, Ruth replied: "Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return away behind thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou stayest, I will stay; thy people is my people, and thy God my God! where thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more also (lit. and so may He add to do)! Death alone shall divide between me and thee." The words &#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; ... &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; are a frequently recurring formula in connection with an oath (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>, etc.), by which the person searing called down upon himself a severe punishment in case he should not keep his word or carry out his resolution. The following &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is not a particle used in swearing instead of &#1488;&#1501; in the sense of "if," equivalent to "surely not," as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a>, in the oath which precedes the formula, but answer to &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; in the sense of quod introducing the declaration, as in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>, etc., signifying, I swear that death, and nothing else than death, shall separate us. Naomi was certainly serious in her intentions, and sincere in the advice which she gave to Ruth, and did not speak in this way merely to try her and put the state of her heart to the proof, "that it might be made manifest whether she would adhere stedfastly to the God of Israel and to herself, despising temporal things and the hope of temporal possessions' (Seb. Schmidt). She had simply the earthly prosperity of her daughter-in-law in her mind, as she herself had been shaken in her faith in the wonderful ways and gracious guidance of the faithful covenant God by the bitter experience of her own life.<p>(Note: "She thought of earthly things alone; and as at that time the Jews almost universally were growing lax in the worship of God, so she, having spent ten years among the Moabites, though it of little consequence whether they adhered to the religion of their fathers, to which they had been accustomed from their infancy or went over to the Jewish religion." - Carpzov.)<p>With Ruth, however, it was evidently not merely strong affection and attachment by which she felt herself so drawn to her mother-in-law that she wished to live and die with her, but a leaning of her heart towards the God of Israel and His laws, of which she herself was probably not yet fully conscious, but which she had acquired so strongly in her conjugal relation and her intercourse with her Israelitish connections, that it was her earnest wish never to be separated from this people and its God (cf. <a href="/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a>). </body></html>
