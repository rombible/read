When Providence had made her poor, she cheerfully stoops to her lot. High spirits will rather starve than stoop; not so Ruth. Nay, it is her own proposal. She speaks humbly in her expectation of leave to glean. We may not demand kindness as a debt, but ask, and take it as a favour, though in a small matter. Ruth also was an example of industry. She loved not to eat the bread of idleness. This is an example to young people. Diligence promises well, both for this world and the other. We must not be shy of any honest employment. No labour is a reproach. Sin is a thing below us, but we must not think any thing else so, to which Providence call us. She was an example of regard to her mother, and of trust in Providence. God wisely orders what seem to us small events; and those that appear altogether uncertain, still are directed to serve his own glory, and the good of his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A kinsman - More literally "an acquaintance"; here (and in the feminine, <a href="/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2</a>) denoting the person with whom one is intimately acquainted, one's near relation.

"There are some," says Lawson, "whose virtue and industry lie only in their tongues. They say, and do not. But Ruth was no less diligent in business than wise in resolution." The later Jews had a set of fantastic bylaws concerning gleaning, detailed by Maimonides. One of them was, that if only one or two stalks fell from the sickle or hand of the reaper, these should be left lying for the gleaners; but if <span class="accented">three stalks</span> fell, then the whole of them belonged to the proprietor (see Carpzov's 'Collegium Rabbinico-Biblicum,' p. 242). Happily for Ruth, her steps were so ordered that the field which she entered as a gleaner belonged to Elimelech's kinsman, Boaz. <span class="cmt_word">And it so happened, runs the story, that it was the portion of the fields that belonged to Boas, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived, the whole town was in commotion on their account (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, imperf. Niph. of &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-45.htm">1 Kings 1:45</a>). They said, "Is this Naomi?" The subject to &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; is the inhabitants of the town, but chiefly the female portion of the inhabitants, who were the most excited at Naomi's return. This is the simplest way of explaining the use of the feminine in the verbs &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;. In these words there was an expression of amazement, not so much at the fact that Naomi was still alive, and had come back again, as at her returning in so mournful a condition, as a solitary widow, without either husband or sons; for she replied (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>), "Call me not Naomi (i.e., gracious), but Marah" (the bitter one), i.e., one who has experienced bitterness, "for the Almighty has made it very bitter to me. I, I went away full, and Jehovah has made me come back again empty. Why do ye call me Naomi, since Jehovah testifies against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me? "Full," i.e., rich, not in money and property, but in the possession of a husband and two sons; a rich mother, but now deprived of all that makes a mother's heart rich, bereft of both husband and sons. "Testified against me," by word and deed (as in <a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-16.htm">2 Samuel 1:16</a>). The rendering "He hath humbled me" (lxx, Vulg., Bertheau, etc.) is incorrect, as &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; with &#1489;&#1468; and the construct state simply means to trouble one's self with anything (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>), which is altogether unsuitable here. - With <a href="/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a> the account of the return of Naomi and her daughter-in-law is brought to a close, and the statement that "they came to Bethlehem in the time of the barley harvest" opens at the same time the way for the further course of the history. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; is pointed as a third pers. perf. with the article in a relative sense, as in <a href="/ruth/2-6.htm">Ruth 2:6</a> and <a href="/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3</a>. Here and at <a href="/ruth/2-6.htm">Ruth 2:6</a> it applies to Ruth; but in <a href="/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3</a> to Naomi. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, the masculine, is used here, as it frequently is, for the feminine &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, as being the more common gender. The harvest, as a whole, commenced with the barley harvest (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>). </body></html>
