The true courtesy of Boaz’s character shows itself in the mention of the maidens. He will not have the stranger even run the chance of rudeness, by being away from the company of her own sex. As the next verse shows, he had already given orders to his men on the subject.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ruth/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/ruth/2-8.htm" title="Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hear you not, my daughter?

Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The grammatical forms of the verbs "go hence" and "abide," are unique and Chaldaic.

The same division of harvest labor obtains in Syria still. Boaz not only granted to Ruth the full privilege of gleaning after his reapers, but provided for her personal comfort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not by the young men, to avoid both occasion of sin and matter of scandal.

Having heard what the servant said concerning her, he turned himself to her, and addressed her in the following manner: <p>hearest thou not, my daughter? meaning not what the servant had said, but hereby exciting her to hearken to what he was about to say to her. Noldius (w) takes the particle to signify beseeching and entreating, and renders the words, "hear, I pray thee, my daughter". Some from hence conclude that Boaz was a man in years, and Ruth much younger than he, and therefore calls her his daughter: <p>go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence; which she might be inclined to, lest she should be thought to be too troublesome to be always in one man's field; but Boaz taking a liking to her, and willing to do her some favour, chose she should not go elsewhere: <p>but abide here fast by my maidens; not maidens that gleaned also as she did, poor maidens he permitted to glean; or that gleaned for the poor, and much less that gleaned for him; a person so rich and liberal as he was would never employ such for his advantage, and to the detriment of the poor; nor would it be admitted of it being contrary to the law as it should seem, and certain it is to the later traditions of the elders; for it is said (x),"a man may not hire a workman on this condition, that his son should glean after him; he who does not suffer the poor to glean, or who suffers one and not another, or who helps any one of them, robs the poor.''But these maidens were such, who either gathered the handfuls, cut and laid down by the reapers, and bound them up in sheaves, or else they also reaped, as it seems from the following verse; and it was very probably customary in those times for women to reap, as it is now with us. <p>(w) Ebr.

He entered into conversation with her, and, among other things, said to her, <span class="cmt_word">Hearest thou not, my daughter!</span> A grave antique way of drawing special attention to what is about to follow. "<span class="accented">My</span> daughter" is a fatherly expression, appropriate on the part of an elderly person when addressing a young woman. <span class="cmt_word">Do not go to glean in the other field.</span> Pointing, no doubt, as he spoke, to a parcel of adjoining fields, belonging to a neighbor proprietor. Boaz's interest and sympathy went out strong, all at once, toward the daughter-in-law of his deceased relative. His heart was smitten with admiration for the modest and fascinating widow. He said further to her, as he walked on along with her in the direction of the reapers, <span class="cmt_word">and also do not pass on hence.</span> The expression is not a redundant repetition of the preceding utterance. It was intended, apparently, to direct Ruth to a particular line of gleaning-ground, probably right behind the sheaf-binders, which it would be advantageous for her to occupy. He would point it out with his hand. <span class="cmt_word">And so keep close by my young women.</span> Their proximity would give the stranger a feeling of security, and her nearness to them in their work would be manifestly for her benefit. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ruth wished to go to the field and glean at (among) the ears, i.e., whatever ears were left lying upon the harvest field (cf. <a href="/ruth/2-7.htm">Ruth 2:7</a>), &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, behind him in whose eyes she should find favour. The Mosaic law (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/23-22.htm">Leviticus 23:22</a>, compared with <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>) did indeed expressly secure to the poor the right to glean in the harvest fields, and prohibited the owners from gleaning themselves; but hard-hearted farmers and reapers threw obstacles in the way of the poor, and even forbade their gleaning altogether. Hence Ruth proposed to glean after him who should generously allow it. She carried out this intention with the consent of Naomi, and chance led her to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, a relation of Elimelech, without her knowing the owner of the field, or being at all aware of his connection with Elimelech. &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, lit., "her chance chanced to hit upon the field."</body></html>
