The reason of the custom, as Bishop Patrick observes, is plain enough, “it being a natural signification that the man resigned his interest in the land by giving to the person redeeming his shoe wherewith he used to walk in it, to the end that he might enter into it, and take possession of it himself.” Or it might signify that as he pulled off, and divested himself of his shoe, so he divested himself of that which he was about to surrender. “It is now the custom with us,” says Rabbi Jarchi, “that a handkerchief or veil be given, instead of a shoe, when we purchase any thing.” <span class="ital">This was a testimony in Israel — </span>This was admitted for sufficient evidence in all such cases.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/ruth/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-8 This matter depended on the laws given by Moses about inheritances, and doubtless the whole was settled in the regular and legal manner. This kinsman, when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it. In like manner many are shy of the great redemption; they are not willing to espouse religion; they have heard well of it, and have nothing to say against it; they will give it their good word, but they are willing to part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring their own inheritance in this world. The right was resigned to Boaz. Fair and open dealing in all matters of contract and trade, is what all must make conscience of, who would approve themselves true Israelites, without guile.

It is a custom, and not a law, that seems here referred to, when an estate was bought and sold; not the law in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>, though that respects the redemption of an estate by a near kinsman, yet no such manner was enjoined as here practised afterwards, made mention of; nor the law in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a> which does not concern the redemption of estates, nor a kinsman's marrying the widow of a deceased kinsman, but a brother's marrying the widow of a deceased brother, and the rites and ceremonies there enjoined upon refusal are different from those here used; though Josephus (i) is express for it, that the law is here referred to; but this is not only concerning purchase of estates, but "concerning changing" also one field for another as Aben Ezra interprets it: "for to confirm all things"; the following custom was observed for the confirmation of any bargain whatever, whether by sale or barter, and where there was no marriage in the case: <p>a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour; signifying thereby, that he yielded his right to him in the thing sold or bartered; the Targum says, he plucked off the glove of his right hand, which perhaps was then in use, when the Targumist wrote, and answered the same purpose; and, according to Jarchi, it was a linen cloth, vail, or handkerchief, that was used, and delivered by the one to the other; and of this way of buying writes Elias (k); at this day, says he, we purchase by a linen cloth or handkerchief called "sudar", which is a garment; and this two witnesses take, and explain before them the words of their agreement, and each of the witnesses stretches out the skirt of the garment, and those that take upon them to confirm every matter, touch the skirt of their garments; and this is called purchasing by "sudar", or the linen cloth: <p>and this was a testimony in Israel; a witness to, or a confirmation of the bargain made; but who gave the shoe, whether the kinsman or Boaz, is not certain from the text; and about which the Jewish writers are divided, as Jarchi observes. <p>(i) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 9. sect. 4.

When <span class="ital">property was transferred</span>, as in the present case, to take off the sandal and hand it to the person in whose favour the transfer is made, gave a symbolic attestation to the act and invested it with legal validity (Driver, <span class="ital">Deut.</span>, p. 283). The same symbolism was used on other occasions, and with varying significance. Thus, when a deceased husband’s brother declined to contract a levirate marriage, the widow loosed his sandal from off his foot in token that he <span class="ital">renounced his right</span> to make her his wife, <a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm" title="Then shall his brother's wife come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done to that man that will not build up his brother's house.">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>; cf. the Arabic form of divorce, ‘she was my slipper and I have cast her off’ (Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Kinship</span> etc., p. 269); the action implied at the same time a feeling of contempt, which is probably denoted by the expression in <a href="/psalms/60-8.htm" title="Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph you because of me.">Psalm 60:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/108-9.htm" title="Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.">Psalm 108:9</a>[5]. The drawing off of the sandal also symbolized among the later Arabs the <span class="ital">renunciation of an oath of fealty</span> to a sovereign: his authority was withdrawn as the sandal from the foot (Goldziher, <span class="ital">Abhandl. z.

Philologie</span>, i. p. 47).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[5] Cf. the story told by Burton, <span class="ital">Land of Midian</span>, ii, p. 196 f.: a man who owned 2000 date-palms was asked by the leader of a band of robbers to sell them; and when he suggested that an offer should be made, the robber, taking off his sandal, exclaimed ‘with this!’ For the Jewish practice of <span class="ital">Chalîtzah</span>, i.e. ‘removal’ of the shoe, see Oesterley and Box, <span class="ital">Rel. and Worship of the Synagogue</span> (1907), p. 294 f.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this was formerly a custom in Israel, on occasion of surrendering rights of kinship, or of selling and buying land, in order to confirm any matter; a man drew off his shoe and gave it to the other contracting party. This was attestation in Israel.</span> We give a free translation. The custom was significant enough. He who sold land, or surrendered his right to act as a kinsman in buying land, intimated by the symbolical act of taking off his shoe, and handing it to his friend, that he freely gave up his right to walk upon the soil, in favor of the person who had acquired the possession. Corresponding symbolical acts, in connection with the transfer of lands, have been common, and probably still are, in many countries. No doubt the shoe, after being received, would be immediately returned. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Boaz had gone up to the gate, and had sat down there." This circumstantial clause introduces the account of the further development of the affair. The gate, i.e., the open space before the city gate, was the forum of the city, the place where the public affairs of the city were discussed. The expression "went up" is not to be understood as signifying that Boaz went up from the threshing-floor where he had slept tot the city, which was situated upon higher ground, for, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>, he had already gone to the city before he went up to the gate; but it is to be explained as referring to the place of justice as an ideal eminence to which a man went up (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>). The redeemer, of whom Boaz had spoken - that is to say, the nearer relation of Elimelech - then went past, and Boaz requested him to come near and sit down. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>, etc.: "Sit down here, such a one." &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;, any one, a certain person, whose name is either unknown or not thought worth mentioning (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/21-3.htm">1 Samuel 21:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8</a>). Boaz would certainly call him by his name; but the historian had either not heard the name, or did not think it necessary to give it.</body></html>
