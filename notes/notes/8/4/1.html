No preliminaries were necessary in summoning one before the public assemblage; no writings and no delay were required.

In the middle of the day, as Josephus (d) says, to the gate of the city, where people were continually passing and repassing to and from the country, and where he was most likely to meet with the person he wanted to see and converse with, and where courts of judicature were usually held, and where it was proper to call one to determine the affair he had in hand; so the Targum,"and Boaz went up to the gate of the house of judgment of the sanhedrim:'' <p>and set him down there; waiting for the person or persons passing by, with whom be chose to speak: <p>and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; the kinsman that was nearer than he, of whom he had spoke to Ruth, that if he would not redeem her, he would; a "behold" is prefixed to this, to observe the providence of God that ordered it so, that he should come that way just at the time Boaz was sitting there, and waiting for him; who perhaps was going into his field to look after his threshers and winnowers, as Boaz had been: <p>unto whom he said, ho, such an one; calling him by his name, though it is not expressed; which the writer of this history might not know, or, if he did, thought it not material to give it, some have been of opinion that it is purposely concealed, as a just retaliation to him, that as he chose not to raise up seed to his kinsman, to perpetuate his name, so his own is buried in oblivion; though it might be done in his favour, that his name might not be known, and lie under disgrace, for refusing to act the part he ought according to the law to have done; hence the plucking off the shoe, and spitting in his face, were done to such an one by way of contempt and reproach. The words are "peloni almoni", words used by the Hebrews of persons and places, whose names they either could not, or did not choose to mention, which two words are contracted into "palmoni" in <a href="/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>. The name of this man was "Tob" or "Tobias", according to some Jewish writers; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>, to him Boaz said, <p>turn aside, and sit down here; and he turned aside, and sat down; instead of going right forward, as he intended, about his business, he turned on one side as he was desired, and sat down by Boaz. <p>(d) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 9. sect. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ruth/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then went Boaz up to the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.

"And sat there," on one of the stones, or stone benches, that were set for the accommodation of the townsfolk. The gateway in the East often corresponded, as a place of meeting, to the forum, or the market-place, in the West. Boaz had reason to believe that his kinsman would be either passing out to his fields, or passing in from his threshing-floor, through the one gate of the city. <span class="cmt_word">And lo, the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken was passing; and he said, Ho, such a one I turn hither and sit here.</span> And he turned and sat down. Boaz called his kinsman by his name; but the writer does not name him, either because he could not, or because he would not. The phrase "such a one," or "so and so," is a purely idiomatic English equivalent for the purely idiomatic Hebrew phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>.

" Ruth's earlier or first love was the love she had shown to her deceased husband and her mother-in-law (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a>, where Boaz praises this love); the later love she had shown in the fact, that as a young widow she had not sought to win the affections of young men, as young women generally do, that she might have a youthful husband, but had turned trustfully to the older man, that he might find a successor to her deceased husband, through a marriage with him, in accordance with family custom (vid., <a href="/ruth/4-10.htm">Ruth 4:10</a>). "And now," added Boaz (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>), "my daughter, fear not; for all that thou sayest I will do to thee: for the whole gate of my people (i.e., all my city, the whole population of Bethlehem, who go in and out at the gate: see <a href="/genesis/34-24.htm">Genesis 34:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-2.htm">Deuteronomy 17:2</a>) knoweth that thou art a virtuous woman." Consequently Boaz saw nothing wrong in the fact that Ruth had come to him, but regarded her request that he would marry her as redeemer as perfectly natural and right, and was ready to carry out her wish as soon as the circumstances would legally allow it. He promised her this (vv. 12, 13), saying, "And now truly I am a redeemer; but there is a nearer redeemer than I. Stay here this night (or as it reads at the end of v. 13, 'lie till the morning'), and in the morning, if he will redeem thee, well, let him redeem; but if it does not please him to redeem thee, I will redeem thee, as truly as Jehovah liveth." &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (Kethibh, v. 12), after a strong assurance, as after the formula used in an oath, "God do so to me," etc., <a href="/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a> (Kethibh), and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>, is to be explained from the use of this particle in the sense of nisi, except that,  equals  only: "only I am redeemer," equivalent to, assuredly I am redeemer (cf. Ewald, 356, b.). Consequently there is no reason whatever for removing the &#1488;&#1501; from the text, as the Masorites have done (in the Keri).<p>(Note: What the &#1500; maju sc., in &#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; signifies, is uncertain. According to the smaller Masora, it was only found among the eastern (i.e., Palestinian) Jews. Consequently Hiller (in his Arcanum Keri et Ctibh, p. 163) conjectures that they used it to point out a various reading, viz., that &#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; should be the reading here. But this is hardly correct.)<p>Ruth was to lie till morning, because she could not easily return to the city in the dark at midnight; but, as is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-14.htm">Ruth 3:14</a>, she did not stay till actual daybreak, but "before one could know another, she rose up, and he said (i.e., as Boaz had said), It must not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor." For this would have injured the reputation not only of Ruth, but also of Boaz himself. </body></html>
