She was a witness for God to the Gentile world, that he had not utterly forsaken them, but that in due time they should become one with his chosen people, and partake of his salvation. Prayer to God attended the marriage, and praise to him attended the birth of the child. What a pity it is that pious language should not be more used among Christians, or that it should be let fall into formality! Here is the descent of David from Ruth. And the period came when Bethlehem-Judah displayed greater wonders than those in the history of Ruth, when the outcast babe of another forlorn female of the same race appeared, controlling the counsels of the Roman master of the world, and drawing princes and wise men from the east, with treasures of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh to his feet. His name shall endure for ever, and all nations shall call Him blessed.

There is something of a poetical turn in this speech of the elders, and something prophetic in the blessing pronounced by them. It is unique and obscure. The Greek Version (lxx) is unintelligible. Jerome seems to have had a slightly different reading, since he applies both clauses to Ruth. "May she be a pattern of virtue in Ephratah, and have a name famous in Bethlehem." The meaning of "be famous" seems to be, Get thyself a name which shall be celebrated in Bethlehem, as the head of a powerful and illustrious house: literally it is, "proclaim a name," i. e. cause others to proclaim thy name, as in <a href="/ruth/4-14.htm">Ruth 4:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ruth/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ru 4:13-18.

This early custom is described in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7</a>, and there its application to the case before us is mentioned afterwards. "Now this was (took place) formerly in Israel in redeeming and exchanging, to confirm every transaction: A man took off his shoe and gave it to another, and this was a testimony in Israel." From the expression "formerly," and also from the description given of the custom in question, it follows that it had gone out of use at the time when our book was composed. The custom itself, which existed among the Indians and the ancient Germans, arose from the fact that fixed property was taken possession of by treading upon the soil, and hence taking off the shoe and handing it to another was a symbol of the transfer of a possession or right of ownership (see the remarks on <a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a> and my Bibl. Archol. ii. p. 66). The Piel &#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is rarely met with in Hebrew; in the present instance it was probably taken from the old legal phraseology. The only other places in which it occurs are <a href="/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-28.htm">Psalm 119:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/119-106.htm">Psalm 119:106</a>, and the book of Esther, where it is used more frequently as a Chaldaism.</body></html>
