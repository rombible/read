She was a witness for God to the Gentile world, that he had not utterly forsaken them, but that in due time they should become one with his chosen people, and partake of his salvation. Prayer to God attended the marriage, and praise to him attended the birth of the child. What a pity it is that pious language should not be more used among Christians, or that it should be let fall into formality! Here is the descent of David from Ruth. And the period came when Bethlehem-Judah displayed greater wonders than those in the history of Ruth, when the outcast babe of another forlorn female of the same race appeared, controlling the counsels of the Roman master of the world, and drawing princes and wise men from the east, with treasures of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh to his feet.

This appendix shows that the special object contemplated by the inspired author of this little book was to preserve the memory of an interesting domestic episode, and to trace the genealogy of David. There was an interval of three hundred eighty years between Salmon and David. It is evident that whole generations are omitted; the leading personages only are named, and grandfathers are said, in Scripture language, to beget their grandchildren, without specifying the intermediate links.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ruth/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now these are the generations of Pharez,....

As such it is incorporated entire in the two tables that are contained respectively in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew, and the third of the Gospel according to Luke. Some of the names are somewhat Grecised and otherwise modified in those New Testament tables. Instead of Hezron we have Esrom; instead of Ram we have Aram; instead of Nahshon we have Naason; instead of Boaz we have Boos; in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-11.htm">1 Chronicles 2:11</a> we have Salma instead of Salmon. It has been keenly debated by chronologists and genealogists whether we should regard the list of David's lineal ancestors, given here and in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-10.htm">1 Chronicles 2:10-12</a>, as also in <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3-5</a>, and <a href="/luke/3-31.htm">Luke 3:31-33</a>, as complete. It is a thorny question to handle, and one not ready to be finally settled till the whole Old Testament chronology be adjusted. It is certain that in the larger tables of our Lord's genealogy there was, apparently for mnemonic purposes (<a href="/matthew/1-17.htm">Matthew 1:17</a>), the mergence of certain inconspicuous links (see <a href="/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8</a>); and it would not need to be matter of wonder or concern if in that section of these tables which contains the genealogy of King David there should be a similar lifting up into the light, on the one hand, of the more prominent ancestors, and a shading off into the dark, on the other, of some who were less conspicuous. It lies on the surface of the genealogy that the loving-kindness and tender mercies of Yahveh stretch far beyond the confines of the Hebrews, highly favored though that people was. "Is he," asks St. Paul, "<span class="accented">the</span> God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes," the same apostle answers, "<span class="accented">of</span> the Gentiles also" (<a href="/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"May thy house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah" (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>). It was from Perez that the ancestors of Boaz, enumerated in <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18</a>. and <a href="/1_chronicles/2-5.htm">1 Chronicles 2:5</a>., were descended. As from Perez, so also from the seed which Jehovah would give to Boaz through Ruth, there should grow up a numerous posterity. </body></html>
