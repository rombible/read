Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tell Ruth what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption, and what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order to accomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct of Boaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantage of Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, nor suspect her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as a virtuous woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived, sent her away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made his promise conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whom the right of redemption belonged.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Spread thy skirt ... - The phrase indicates receiving and acknowledging her as a wife. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ruth/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

To spread a skirt over one is, in the East, a symbolical action denoting protection. To this day in many parts of the East, to say of anyone that he put his skirt over a woman, is synonymous with saying that he married her; and at all the marriages of the modern Jews and Hindus, one part of the ceremony is for the bridegroom to put a silken or cotton cloak around his bride.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Spread thy skirt over thine hand-maid, </span> i.e. take me to be thy wife, and perform the duty of an husband to me.

So Jarchi,"spread the skirt of thy garments to cover me with thy talith, and this is expressive of marriage;''and Aben Ezra says, it intimates taking her to him for wife; though as the word signifies a wing, the allusion may be to the wings of birds spread over their young, to cherish and protect them, which are acts to be done by a man to his wife: <p>for thou art a near kinsman; as she had been informed by Naomi, to whom the right of redemption of her husband's estate belonged, and in whom it lay to marry her, and raise up seed to his kinsman, her former husband. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ruth/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said, Who art thou?

The custom prevailed among the early Arabs; a good illustration is given in Ṭabarî’s commentary on the Koran (Sura 4:23, forbidding men to ‘inherit women against their will’): ‘In the Jâhilîya, when a man’s father or brother or son died and left a widow, the dead man’s heir, if he came at once and threw his garment over her, had the right to marry her under the dowry of [i.e. already paid by] her [deceased] lord, or to give her in marriage and take her dowry. But if she anticipated him and went off to her own people, then the disposal of her hand belonged to herself’; Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Kinship</span> etc., p. 87. See also Sale’s translation of the Koran (Warne & Co.), p. 56 and note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a near kinsman</span>] The primary meaning of the Hebr. <span class="ital">go’el</span> is ‘one who enforces a claim’ which has lapsed; so ‘one who re-claims’ or ‘re-vindicates.’ Hence the verb is used of <span class="ital">redeeming</span> a house or field after it has been sold, or an Israelite who has been obliged to sell himself as a slave (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm" title="If your brother be waxen poor, and has sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.">Leviticus 25:25</a> ff., <a href="/leviticus/25-47.htm" title="And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by you, and your brother that dwells by him wax poor, and sell himself to the stranger or sojourner by you, or to the stock of the stranger's family:">Leviticus 25:47</a> ff.), or something which has been vowed to Jehovah; in the expression <span class="ital">go’el had-dâm</span>, ‘the avenger of blood,’ <a href="/deuteronomy/19-6.htm" title="Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-12.htm" title="Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.">Deuteronomy 19:12</a> etc., it denotes ‘one who vindicates the rights of the murdered man;’ see Driver in loc. But since a man was not as a rule able himself to <span class="ital">redeem</span> a right which had lapsed, the duty fell upon his family and more particularly upon his nearest relative; in this way <span class="ital">go’el</span> came to mean ‘the next of kin.’ Boaz, however, was not the nearest relative (<span class="ital"><a href="/ruth/3-12.htm" title="And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.">Ruth 3:12</a></span>), so he could not act unless the next of kin declined; nor did the Pentatenchal law require the <span class="ital">go’el</span> to marry the widow of the deceased in addition to redeeming his property, though custom sanctioned the marriage. Hence Ruth’s appeal to the generosity of Boaz.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Who art thou? And she said, I am Ruth, thy handmaid; and thou hast spread thy wings over thy handmaid, for thou art kinsman.</span> The Syriac translator spoils the question of Boaz by metamorphosing it from "<span class="accented">Who</span> art thou?" into "<span class="accented">What</span> is thy message?" Tremulous would be the voice of Ruth as she replied,  "I am Ruth, thy handmaid." What she said in continuance has been very generally, and by Driver, among others ('Hebrew Tenses,' p. 135), misapprehended. Not by Raabe, however. It has been regarded as a petition presented to Boaz - "Spread thy wings (or, <span class="accented">thy wing</span>) over thy handmaid, for thou art kinsman." The literal translation, however, and far the more delicate idea, as also far the more effective representation, is, "And thou hast spread thy wings over thy handmaid, for thou art kinsman." Ruth explains her position under Boaz's coverlet as if it were his own deliberate act. Such is her felicitous way of putting the case. It is as if she had said, "The position in which thy handmaid actually is exhibits the true relation in which thou standest to thy handmaid. She is under thy wings. Thou hast benignantly spread them over her, for thou art kinsman." The Masorites have correctly regarded <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e0;&#x5e4;</span> as a <span class="accented">scriptio defectiva</span> for the dual of the noun, and hence have punctuated it <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, "thy wings." The majority of interpreters, however, have assumed that the word is singular, and have hence translated it as if it had been punctuated <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>. The dual reading is to be preferred. Boaz himself had represented Ruth as having come trustfully under the wings of Yahveh (see <a href="/ruth/2-12.htm">Ruth 2:12</a>). She accepted the representation. It was beautifully true. But, as she was well aware that God often works through human agency, she now recognized the Divine hand in the kindness of Boaz. "<span class="accented">Thou hast spread thy wings</span> over thine handmaid." She was under his wings because she had come under the wings of Yahveh. She felt like a little timid chicken; but she had found a refuge. It is the wings of tender, gentle, sheltering care that are referred to. There is only indirect allusion to the typical coverlet under which she lay. <span class="cmt_word">For thou art kinsman</span> (see <a href="/ruth/2-20.htm">Ruth 2:20</a>). The native modesty of Ruth led her to account for her position by a reference to the law of kinship. She had rights, and she stood upon them. She conceived that Boaz had correlative duties to discharge; but we may be sure that she would never have made the least reference to her rights, or to the correlative duties which she regarded as devolving on Boaz, had she not known that his heart was already hers. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Wash and anoint thyself (&#1505;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;  equals  &#1504;&#1505;&#1498;), and put on thy clothes (thy best clothes), and go down (from Bethlehem, which stood upon the ridge of a hill) to the threshing-floor; let not thyself be noticed by the man (Boaz) till he has finished eating and drinking. And when he lies down, mark the place where he will sleep, and go (when he has fallen asleep) and uncover the place of his feet, and lay thyself down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do."</body></html>
