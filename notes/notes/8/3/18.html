Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would be sure to manage it well. Much more reason have true believers to cast their care on God, because he has promised to care for them. Our strength is to sit still, Isa 30:7. This narrative may encourage us to lay ourselves by faith at the feet of Christ: He is our near Kinsman; having taken our nature upon him. He has the right to redeem. Let us seek to receive from him his directions: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Ac 9:6. He will never blame us as doing this unseasonably. And let us earnestly desire and seek the same rest for our children and friends, that it may be well with them also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who art thou, my daughter? - In the dim twilight <a href="/ruth/3-14.htm">Ruth 3:14</a> her mother was not sure at first who the young woman was, who sought admittance into the house. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ruth/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. six measures of barley&#8212;Hebrew, "six seahs," a seah contained about two gallons and a half, six of which must have been rather a heavy load for a woman.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ruth/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then, said she, sit still, my daughter,....

" Ruth's earlier or first love was the love she had shown to her deceased husband and her mother-in-law (comp. <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a>, where Boaz praises this love); the later love she had shown in the fact, that as a young widow she had not sought to win the affections of young men, as young women generally do, that she might have a youthful husband, but had turned trustfully to the older man, that he might find a successor to her deceased husband, through a marriage with him, in accordance with family custom (vid., <a href="/ruth/4-10.htm">Ruth 4:10</a>). "And now," added Boaz (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>), "my daughter, fear not; for all that thou sayest I will do to thee: for the whole gate of my people (i.e., all my city, the whole population of Bethlehem, who go in and out at the gate: see <a href="/genesis/34-24.htm">Genesis 34:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-2.htm">Deuteronomy 17:2</a>) knoweth that thou art a virtuous woman." Consequently Boaz saw nothing wrong in the fact that Ruth had come to him, but regarded her request that he would marry her as redeemer as perfectly natural and right, and was ready to carry out her wish as soon as the circumstances would legally allow it. He promised her this (vv. 12, 13), saying, "And now truly I am a redeemer; but there is a nearer redeemer than I. Stay here this night (or as it reads at the end of v. 13, 'lie till the morning'), and in the morning, if he will redeem thee, well, let him redeem; but if it does not please him to redeem thee, I will redeem thee, as truly as Jehovah liveth." &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (Kethibh, v. 12), after a strong assurance, as after the formula used in an oath, "God do so to me," etc., <a href="/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a> (Kethibh), and <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>, is to be explained from the use of this particle in the sense of nisi, except that,  equals  only: "only I am redeemer," equivalent to, assuredly I am redeemer (cf. Ewald, 356, b.). Consequently there is no reason whatever for removing the &#1488;&#1501; from the text, as the Masorites have done (in the Keri).<p>(Note: What the &#1500; maju sc., in &#1500;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; signifies, is uncertain. According to the smaller Masora, it was only found among the eastern (i.e., Palestinian) Jews. Consequently Hiller (in his Arcanum Keri et Ctibh, p. 163) conjectures that they used it to point out a various reading, viz., that &#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497; should be the reading here. But this is hardly correct.)<p>Ruth was to lie till morning, because she could not easily return to the city in the dark at midnight; but, as is shown in <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/3-14.htm">Ruth 3:14</a>, she did not stay till actual daybreak, but "before one could know another, she rose up, and he said (i.e., as Boaz had said), It must not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor." For this would have injured the reputation not only of Ruth, but also of Boaz himself. </body></html>
