Therefore it should be engaged in with great seriousness, with earnest prayers for direction, for the blessing of God, and with regard to his precepts. Parents should carefully advise their children in this important concern, that it may be well with them as to their souls. Be it always remembered, That is best for us which is best for our souls. The course Naomi advised appears strange to us; but it was according to the laws and usages of Israel. If the proposed measure had borne the appearance of evil, Naomi would not have advised it. Law and custom gave Ruth, who was now proselyted to the true religion, a legal claim upon Boaz. It was customary for widows to assert this claim, De 25:5-10. But this is not recorded for imitation in other times, and is not to be judged by modern rules. And if there had been any evil in it, Ruth was a woman of too much virtue and too much sense to have listened to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed be he of the Lord ... - We may gather from Naomi's allusion to the dead that both her husband and son had been faithful servants of Jehovah, the God of Israel.

This interrogation carries in it the force of a strong affirmation, may suggest that she judged it to be her duty, and that she was determined to seek out such a rest for her; and the Targum makes her way of speaking stronger still, for that is,"by an oath I will not rest, until the time that I have sought a rest for thee.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ruth/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</span><p>(a) Meaning that she would provide her with a husband, with whom she might live peacefully.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. 3. <span class="ital">Ruth appeals to Boaz to do the kinsman’s part<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span><span class="bld">1</span><span class="ital">.</span> <span class="ital">seek rest</span>] <span class="bld">a resting place</span> marg.; see on <a href="/ruth/1-9.htm" title="The LORD grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.

Naomi was quick to note the varying '<span class="accented">nuances</span> of feeling, and said "<span class="accented">My</span> daughter, shall I not seek out for thee a rest?" The expression <span class="accented">rest</span>, or <span class="accented">resting-place</span>, though in itself of generic import, was, when used in such circumstances as environed Ruth, quite specific in application, and would be at once understood. It was <span class="accented">a home</span> to which Naomi pointed, a home for her daughter's heart. In such a home, if warm and pure, there would be repose for the affections. "That it may be well with thee," or, "which shall (or may) be good for thee." Either translation is warrantable and excellent. The latter is the most simple, and is given by Carpzov and Rosenm&uuml;ller; but the former is in accordance with a frequent idiomatic use of the expression, in which there is a change <span class="accented">from the relative in result to the relative in aim</span>, so that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (see <a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3, 18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-11.htm">Deuteronomy 10:11</a>, 25, 28). Naomi did not distinguish between <span class="accented">rests</span> that would be 'good, ' and other <span class="accented">rests</span> which would not be 'good.' Nor did she moralize on the idea of a <span class="accented">rest</span>, and affirm that it would be 'good' for her widowed daughter-in-law. She assumed that <span class="accented">every</span> true <span class="accented">rest</span> was 'good,' and, on the basis of that assumption, she sought out one for her devoted Ruth. Hence the superiority of the rendering that expresses <span class="accented">aim</span> to that which expresses the mere prediction of <span class="accented">result</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This she brought to her mother-in-law in the city, and "drew out (sc., from her pocket, as the Chaldee has correctly supplied) what she had left from her sufficiency," i.e., of the parched corn which Boaz had reached her (<a href="/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>).</body></html>
