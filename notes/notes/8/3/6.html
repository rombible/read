Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tell Ruth what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption, and what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order to accomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct of Boaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantage of Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, nor suspect her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as a virtuous woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived, sent her away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made his promise conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whom the right of redemption belonged.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Uncover his feet - Rather, "the place of his feet;" the foot of his bed, as we should say.

In ordinary circumstances these would have seemed indecorous to the world; but in the case of Ruth, it was a method, doubtless conformable to prevailing usage, of reminding Boaz of the duty which devolved on him as the kinsman of her deceased husband. Boaz probably slept upon a mat or skin; Ruth lay crosswise at his feet&#8212;a position in which Eastern servants frequently sleep in the same chamber or tent with their master; and if they want a covering, custom allows them that benefit from part of the covering on their master's bed. Resting, as the Orientals do at night, in the same clothes they wear during the day, there was no indelicacy in a stranger, or even a woman, putting the extremity of this cover over her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ruth/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she went down unto the floor,.... From the city of Bethlehem, from her mother-in-law's house there, to the threshingfloor of Boaz, which was at some distance from it, and lower: <p>and did according to all that her mother in law bade her; both before she went, and after: she washed and anointed herself, and put on her best clothes before she went down, and when she was there took care not to make herself known to any, especially to Boaz, and marked the place where he lay down after he had supped. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ruth/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law had enjoined. And Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was comfortable; and he went to lie down at the end of the heap; and she came softly, and uncovered the parts about his feet, and laid herself down.</span> The translation in King James's version, "and his heart was <span class="accented">merry</span>," is perhaps stronger than there is any occasion for. The word rendered "was <span class="accented">merry</span>," - viz., <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> - is literally "was <span class="accented">good</span>."

It was <span class="accented">good</span> to him. Hence he ate and drank to his heart's content, enjoying with grateful spirit the bounties of a gracious Providence. By and by he retired to rest, amid visions perchance of a brightened home, which just helped to reflect on his consciousness a stronger resolution than he had ever formed before to make known his affection At length he slept. The Syriac translate adds interpretatively, "<span class="accented">in</span> a sweet sleep or the floor." Ruth then stepped cautiously forth to play her delicate part. She stole softly to the sheltered spot where he lay. She gently uncovered the margin of the cloak, which lay over the place where his feet were laid. She laid herself down noiselessly. The Arabic translator adds, "and slept beside him" - a most unhappy interpretation. Nothing but sin would be so far away as sleep from the eyes, and mind, and heart of the anxious suitor. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this Ruth kept with the maidens of Boaz during the whole of the barley and wheat harvests gleaning ears of corn, and lived with her mother-in-law, sc., when she returned in the evening from the field. In this last remark there is a tacit allusion to the fact that a change took place for Ruth when the harvest was over. </body></html>
