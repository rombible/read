The land of Moab seems to have been of exceptional richness and fertility, as allusions in the threats of Isaiah 16 Jeremiah 38, indicate. It was divided from the land of Israel by the. Dead Sea, and on the north by the river Arnon, the old boundary between Moab and the Amorites (<a href="/numbers/21-13.htm" title="From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.">Numbers 21:13</a>). The journey of the family from Bethlehem would probably first lead them near Jericho, and so across the fords of the Jordan into the territory of the tribe of Reuben. Through the hilly country of this tribe, another long journey would bring them to the Arnon, the frontier river.<p>How far Elimelech was justified in fleeing, even under the pressure of the famine, from the land of Jehovah to a land where Chemosh was worshipped and the abominations practised of Baal-peor, may well be doubted, even though God overruled it all for good. It was disobeying the spirit of God’s law, and holding of little value the blessings of the land of promise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/ruth/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/ruth/1-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.

And the removal ended in the wasting of his family. It is folly to think of escaping that cross, which, being laid in our way, we ought to take up. Changing our place seldom is mending it. Those who bring young people into bad acquaintance, and take them out of the way of public ordinances, thought they may think them well-principled, and armed against temptation, know not what will be the end. It does not appear that the women the sons of Elimelech married, were proselyted to the Jewish religion. Earthly trials or enjoyments are of short continuance. Death continually removes those of every age and situation, and mars all our outward comforts: we cannot too strongly prefer those advantages which shall last for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the days when the Judges ruled - "Judged."

So that it appears that this history is of time and things after the affair of Micah, and of the concubine of the Levite, and of the war between Israel and Benjamin; for in those times there was no king nor judge in Israel; but to what time of the judges, and which government of theirs it belongs to, is not agreed on. Josephus (o) places it in the government of Eli, but that is too late for Boaz, the grandfather of Jesse, the father of David, to live. Some Jewish writers, as Jarchi, say it was in the times of Ibzan, who they say (p) is the same with Boaz, but without proof, and which times are too late also for this history. The Jewish chronology (q) comes nearer the truth, which carries it up as high as the times of Eglon, king of Moab, when Ehud was judge; and with which Dr. Lightfoot (r) pretty much agrees, who puts this history between the third and fourth chapters of Judges, and so must belong to the times of Ehud or Shamgar. Junius refers it to the times of Deborah and Barak; and others (s), on account of the famine, think it began in the times the Midianites oppressed Israel, and carried off the fruits of the earth, which caused it, when Gideon was raised up to be their judge; Alting (t) places it in the time of Jephthah; such is the uncertainty about the time referred to: <p>that there was a famine in the land; the land of Canaan, that very fruitful country. The Targum says this was the sixth famine that had been in the world, and it was in the days of Boaz, who is called Ibzan the just, and who was of Bethlehemjudah; but it is more probable that it was in the days of Gideon, as before observed, than in the days of Ibzan <p>and a certain man of Bethlehemjudah; so called to distinguish it from another Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulun, <a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a> which had its name from the fruitfulness of the place, and the plenty of bread in it, and yet the famine was here; hence this man with his family removed from it: <p>and went to sojourn in the country of Moab; where there was plenty; not to dwell there, but to sojourn for a time, until the famine was over: <p>he and his wife, and his two sons; the names of each of them are next given. <p>par (o) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 9. sect. 1.((p) T.

In this also it is described how Jesus Christ, who according to the flesh came from David, proceeded by Ruth, of whom the Lord Jesus promised to come, nonetheless she was a Moabite of base condition, and a stranger to the people of God; declaring to us by it that the Gentiles would be sanctified by him, and joined with his people, and that there would be one sheepfold, and one shepherd.

The "And" is somewhat remarkable, standing at the commencement of the Book. But as it is also found at the commencement of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Ezekiel, Esther, and Ezra, its use, though inartistic, must be amenable to some literary law. The Books specified, even including Ezekiel, are historical They are parcels of history, each narrating events that had their genesis in more or less significant antecedent occurrences. This historical genesis, so very different from an "absolute commencement" of things, is indicated, though probably in unreflective spontaneity, by the copulative "And." <span class="cmt_word">In the days when the judges ruled.</span> Or, more literally, "when the judges judged." In primitive times there was no function that was more important for society than that of judiciously settling disputes between man and man. Every such settlement, besides conferring a benefit on society, and in particular on the individuals at variance, would increase the moral influence and social elevation of the judge. By and by his moral and social superiority would, in favorable circumstances, grow into authority, specifically judicial on the one hand, and generically political, or semi-political, on the other. When military prowess and skill in strategy were added, a ruler, champion, or leader would be the result. Many such leaders rose up among the Hebrews ere yet society was compactly organized. They were vanously endowed; but most of them were only very partially equipped for the judicious administration of the affairs of the commonwealth. All, however, were called <span class="accented">judges</span>; and the discharge of their high duties was denominated <span class="accented">judging</span>, even when it was entirely inconspicuous as regards judicial ability or judicious determinations. The Hebrew word for <span class="accented">judge</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;</span> <span class="accented">shofet</span>; and it is an interesting evidence of the very close kinship of Hebrew and Phoenician, that in Carthage the chief magistrate, as we learn from Livy and other Roman writers, was called <span class="accented">sufes</span> (originally, as we see from the inflection, <span class="accented">sufet</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>That there was a famine.</span> An admirable though free rendering. In the original the structure of the whole statement is exceedingly primitive and "agglutinative" - <span class="accented">And</span> (<span class="accented">it</span>) <span class="accented">was in the days of the judging of the judges</span>, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">there</span>) <span class="accented">was a famine</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>In the land.</span> Namely, of Israel. The non-specification of the particular country referred to is evidence that the writer was living in it, as one at home. Josephus says that it was under the judgeship of Eli, the high priest, that the famine spoken of occurred ('Antiquities,' 5:9, 1). But here the historian speaks "without book," and without any particular plausibility. Several expositors, such as Bishop Patrick, have antedated, by a very long way, the calculation of Josephus They would assign the famine to the period when the Midianites and Amalekites came up, "as grasshoppers for multitude, to destroy the land," so that Israel was greatly impoverished (see <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>.). But it is in vain to multiply guesses. The date of the famine is not given, and it is futile to make inquisition for it. <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man.</span> The interpolation of the individualizing word "<span class="accented">certain"</span> is quite uncalled for, and now quite archaic. The simplicity of the original is sufficient, "And a man. <span class="cmt_word">Of Bethlehem</span>-<span class="cmt_word">judah.</span> Or, as it might be still more literally represented, "of Bethlehem, Judah." Them is no such single name as Bethlehem-judah.  There is only the apposition, for discrimination's sake, of one geographical name to another, just as we may say, in English, <span class="accented">Boston</span>, <span class="accented">Lincolnshire</span>, or <span class="accented">Alexandria</span>, <span class="accented">Dumbartonshire</span>. The localization of the main name is thus effectually indicated. There is another Alexandria in Egypt; there is another Boston in the United States of America; and there was in Palestine another Bethlehem, namely, in the canton of Zebulun (see <a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). Bethlehem, Judah, lies about six miles to the south of Jerusalem. "Its appearance," says Dr. Porter, "is striking. It is situated on a narrow ridge, which projects eastward from the central mountain range, and breaks down in abrupt terraced slopes to deep valleys on the north, east, and south. The terraces, admirably kept, and covered with rows of olives, intermixed with the fig and the vine, sweep in graceful curves round the ridge, regular as stairs" ('Syria and Palestine,' D. 199). The valleys below are exceptionally fertile, and have been so from time immemorial. Hence indeed the name <span class="accented">Beth-lehem</span>, or <span class="accented">Bread-house</span>. Its modern name is <span class="accented">Beit-lahm</span>, or <span class="accented">Flesh-house</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Went to sojourn in the land of Moab.</span> We have no word in English that exactly, corresponds to the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> rendered <span class="accented">sojourn</span>. The cognate noun is uniformly translated, in King James's version, <span class="accented">stranger</span>, and means <span class="accented">foreigner</span>. The verb means <span class="accented">to dwell as a foreigner</span>, but its root-idea is yet undetermined. The Latin <span class="accented">peregrinari</span> admirably corresponds. The man of Bethlehem, Judah, went forth from his own country to "peregrinate" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) "in the land of Moab;" literally, "in the fields of Moab," that is, "in the pastoral parts of the territory of Moab." It was not a very great way off, this land of his "peregrination." Its blue mountains, rising up luridly beyond the silver thread of the Jordan and the gleaming expanse of the Dead Sea, are distinctly visible from the Mount of Olives and the heights about Bethlehem. <span class="cmt_word">He, and his wife, and his two sons.</span> The resumptive he is employed for the purpose of linking on to him, in his "peregrination, the other members of the little household. He emigrated "along with his wife and two sons." He had fought hard to keep the wolf of hunger from his door, but was like to be beaten.
