The fault of settling on a heathen soil begun by the father is carried on by the sons in marrying heathen women, for such we cannot doubt they must have been in the first instance. The Targum (or ancient Chaldee paraphrase) says: “They transgressed against the decree of the Word of the Lord, and took to themselves strange wives.” This act was to incur a further risk of being involved in idolatry, as King Solomon found.<p><span class= "bld">Ruth.</span>—This name will mean either “comeliness” or “companion.” according to the spelling of which we suppose the present name to be a contraction.

And the removal ended in the wasting of his family. It is folly to think of escaping that cross, which, being laid in our way, we ought to take up. Changing our place seldom is mending it. Those who bring young people into bad acquaintance, and take them out of the way of public ordinances, thought they may think them well-principled, and armed against temptation, know not what will be the end. It does not appear that the women the sons of Elimelech married, were proselyted to the Jewish religion. Earthly trials or enjoyments are of short continuance. Death continually removes those of every age and situation, and mars all our outward comforts: we cannot too strongly prefer those advantages which shall last for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Marriages of Israelites with women of Ammon or Moab are nowhere in the Law expressly forbidden, as were marriages with the women of Canaan <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-3</a>.

This was a violation of the Mosaic law (De 7:3; 23:3; Ezr 9:2; Ne 13:23); and Jewish writers say that the early deaths of both the young men were divine judgments inflicted on them for those unlawful connections.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the women of Moab; </span> either these were proselytes when they married them, which may well be doubted, from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/ruth/1-15.htm" title="And she said, Behold, your sister in law is gone back to her people, and to her gods: return you after your sister in law.">Ruth 1:15</a></span>, or they sinned in marrying them, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm" title="Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.">Deu 7:3</a> 23:3 <a href="/ezra/9-1.htm" title="Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.">Ezra 9:1</a>,2 Ne 13:23</span>, and therefore were punished with short life and want of issue, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/ruth/1-5.htm" title="And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.">Ruth 1:5</a>,19,21</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">About ten years; </span> as long as the famine lasted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ruth/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they took them wives of the women of Moab,....

The Midrash Rabbah on this Book explains that <span class="ital">Orpah</span> was so called ‘because she turned her <span class="ital">neck</span> (<span class="ital">‘oreph</span>) on her mother in law’; possibly the name may=‘obstinacy’ (cf. <span class="ital">stiffnecked</span>, <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:">Exodus 32:9</a> etc.).

Josephus, reproducing the narrative from memory, represents the event as occurring in the father's lifetime, and as brought about by his arrangement. He says of Elimelech, "Coming into the territory of Moab, he sojourns there, and, things pros-paring according to his mind, he gives in marriage to his sons (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) Moabitish wives." Theological critics have here again raised the question, Was it sinful in these emigrant Hebrews to take in marriage daughters of the land? The Chaldee Targumist did not hesitate in his decision. He begins his paraphrase of the verse, thus - "And they transgressed the edict of the word of the Lord, and took to themselves alien wives of the daughters of Mesh." Dr. Thomas Fuller represents Naomi as passionately remonstrating with her sons. He says of himself, "<span class="accented">My</span> mouth denieth to be the orator of an unjust action." "Nothing can be brought," he adds, "for the defense of these matches. Something may be said for the excuse of them, but that fetched not from piety, but from policy." It is note worthy, however, that in the text itself, and throughout the entire Book, there is nothing of the nature of condemnation, not the least hint of blame. There was a law, indeed, which laid an interdict upon marriages with Canaanites (see <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>). But these Canaanites occupied a peculiar relation to the Hebrews. They were within the line of that Canaan which had become the land of Israel. Israelites and Canaanites were thus living within the same borders as rival claimants of the same territory. It was no wonder that the Canaanites' claim was not  to be recognized by the Hebrews. The Moabites, however, living within the lines or "coasts" of their own distinct territory, stood in quite a different relation. And while, for purity's sake, great restrictions were to be laid upon all overtures for naturalization (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>), yet the law could never he intended to apply to the families of Hebrews who were settlers in Moab, or to Moabitish females living in their own land, and rather awarding than seeking the prerogatives' of natives. <span class="cmt_word">The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth.</span> No doubt native Moabitish names. Much ingenuity has been expended on that of the more interesting person. Some have unwarrantably assumed that <span class="accented">Ruth</span> is a contraction of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span> meaning a <span class="accented">female companion</span> or <span class="accented">friend</span>. Still more unwarrantable, though more captivating to the aesthetic imagination, is the signification which is given to the word by Weruer and Eadie, namely, <span class="accented">beauty</span>. It is founded on an impossible derivation from the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Still more aesthetically captivating is the conjecture of Cassel, that the name is the ancient Semitic form of the Indo-European word <span class="accented">rodon</span> or <span class="accented">rose</span>. "At all events," says he, "the thought of Ruth <span class="accented">as the Rose of Moab</span> is in itself too attractive not to be proposed as a conjecture." It is certainly, most attractive and most admirable as a <span class="accented">jeu d'esprit</span>, but too imaginative to be vindicated on grounds of comparative philology. <span class="cmt_word">And they dwelt there.</span> Or, "settled themselves there; literally, "sat them."
