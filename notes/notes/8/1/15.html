Orpah was loth to part from her; yet she did not love her well enough to leave Moab for her sake. Thus, many have a value and affection for Christ, yet come short of salvation by him, because they will not forsake other things for him. They love him, yet leave him, because they do not love him enough, but love other things better. Ruth is an example of the grace of God, inclining the soul to choose the better part. Naomi could desire no more than the solemn declaration Ruth made. See the power of resolution; it silences temptation. Those that go in religious ways without a stedfast mind, stand like a door half open, which invites a thief; but resolution shuts and bolts the door, resists the devil and forces him to flee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The kiss at parting as well as at meeting is the customary friendly and respectful salutation in the East. The difference between mere kindness of manner and self-sacrificing love is most vividly depicted in the words and conduct of the two women. Ruth's determination is stedfast to cast in her lot with the people of the Lord (compare the marginal references and <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22-28</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/ruth/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the hand of the Lord is gone out against me&#8212;that is, I am not only not in a condition to provide you with other husbands, but so reduced in circumstances that I cannot think of your being subjected to privations with me. The arguments of Naomi prevailed with Orpah, who returned to her people and her gods. But Ruth clave unto her; and even in the pages of Sterne, that great master of pathos, there is nothing which so calls forth the sensibilities of the reader as the simple effusion he has borrowed from Scripture&#8212;of Ruth to her mother-in-law [Chalmers].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto her people, and unto her gods; </span> which she saith, partly, to try Ruth’s sincerity and constancy; partly, that by upbraiding Orpah with her idolatry she might consequently turn her from it; and partly, that she might intimate to her, that if she went with her, she must embrace the true God and religion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/ruth/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she said,.... That is, Naomi to Ruth, after Orpah was gone: <p>behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods; meaning Orpah, who was the wife of her husband's brother, as the word used signifies; she was not only on the road turning back to her own country and people, but to the gods thereof, Baalpeor or Priapus, and Chemosh, <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> from whence Aben Ezra concludes, that she had been a proselyte to the true religion, and had renounced the gods of her nation, and retained the same profession while her husband lived, and unto this time, and now apostatized, since she is said to go back to her gods; and in this he is followed by some Christian interpreters (g), and not without reason: <p>return thou after thy sister in law: this she said, not that in good earnest she desired her to return, at least to her former religion, only relates, though not as approving of, the conduct of her sister, rather as upbraiding it; but to try her sincerity and steadfastness, when such an instance and example was before her. <p>(g) Clericus &amp; Rambachius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ruth/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> return thou after thy sister in law.</span><p>(g) No persuasion can convince them to turn back from God, if he has chosen them to be his.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">unto her people, and unto her god</span>] i.e. Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm" title="Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:29</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-33.htm" title="Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.">1 Kings 11:33</a>. The ancient belief here receives its simplest expression: each land and people had its own Deity inseparably connected with it; outside lay the territory of another god. The Israelites, at any rate the popular religion in Israel, did not deny the divinity of the gods of the neighbouring lands, though for themselves Jehovah was the only God; cf. <a href="/judges/11-24.htm" title="Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?

If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1 Samuel 26:19</a>. So when Orpah goes back to Moab she goes back to her native god; similarly, when Ruth determines to make her home in Judah, she declares her intention of adopting the religion of her new country, <span class="ital"><a href="/ruth/1-16.htm" title="And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:">Ruth 1:16</a></span>. See <span class="ital"><a href="/ruth/1-8.htm" title="And Naomi said to her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.">Ruth 1:8</a></span> <span class="ital">n</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.</span> The expression that stands in King James's version thus, "and to her gods," is rendered by Dr. Cassel "<span class="accented">and</span> to her God." The same interpretation, it is noteworthy, is given in the Targum of Jonathan, who renders the expression,  "and to her Fear" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>). Such a translation assumes that the Moabites were not only theists, but monotheists. And yet  in the mythology, or primitive theology, of Moab, we read both of Baal-Peor and of Chemosh. As to the former, see <a href="/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8, 5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-3.htm">Deuteronomy 4:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>. As to the latter, see <a href="/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7, 33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7, 13</a>. In Numbers, moreover, 21:29, and in <a href="/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a>, the Moabites are called the <span class="accented">people of Chemosh</span>, and frequently is their national god called Chemosh in the inscription of King Mesha on <span class="accented">the Moabitish Stone</span>, so recently discovered and deciphered. It is supposed, not without reason, that the two names belonged to one deity, Chemosh being the old native name. Nevertheless, the translation "to her god" is an interpretation, not a literal rendering, and, on the other hand, the translation "to her gods" would, on the hypothesis of the monotheism of the Moabites, be unidiomatic. The original expression, "to her Elohim," does not tell anything, and was not intended by Naomi to tell anything, or to hint anything, of a numerical character concerning the object or objects of the Moabitish worship. <span class="accented">It was an expression equally appropriate whether there was</span>, <span class="accented">or was not</span>, <span class="accented">a plurality of objects worshipped</span>. It might be liberally rendered, <span class="accented">and to her own forms of religious worship</span>. The word <span class="accented">elohim</span> was a survival of ancient polytheistic theology and worship, when a plurality of powers were held in awe. "<span class="accented">For</span>," says Fuller, "the heathen, supposing that the whole world, with all the creatures therein, was too great a diocese to be daily visited by one and the same deity, they therefore assigned sundry gods to several creatures." The time arrived, however, when the great idea flashed into the Hebrew mind, <span class="accented">The Powers are One</span> and hence the plural noun, with its subtended conception of unity, became construed with verbs and adjectives in the singular number. It was so construed when applied to the one living God; but it readily retained its original applicability to a plurality of deifies, and hence, in such a passage as the one before us, where there is neither adjective nor verb to indicate the number, the word is quite incapable of exact rendering into English. <span class="cmt_word">Orpah had returned to her people and her Elohim.</span> Return thou after thy sister-in-law. Are we then to suppose that Naomi desired Ruth to return to her Moabitish faith? Is it with a slight degree of criticism that she referred to Orpah's palinode? Would she desire that Ruth should, in this matter, follow in her sister-in-law's wake? We touch on tender topics. Not unlikely she had all along suspected or seen that Orpah would not have insuperable religious scruples. And not unlikely, too, she would herself be free from narrow religious bigotry, at least to the extent of dimly admitting that the true worship of the heart could reach the true God, even when offensive names, and forms, and symbolisms were present in the outer courts of the creed. Nevertheless, when she said to Ruth, "Return thou after thy sister-in-law," she no doubt was rather putting her daughter-in-law to a final test, and leading her to thorough self-sifting, than encouraging her to go back to her ancestral forms of worship. "God," says Fuller, "<span class="accented">wrestled</span> with Jacob with desire to be conquered; so Naomi no doubt opposed Ruth, hoping and wishing that she herself might be foiled." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"On the way," i.e., when they had gone a part of the way, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each one to her mother's house," - not her father's, though, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a>, Ruth's father at any rate was still living, but her mother's, because maternal love knows best how to comfort a daughter in her affliction. "Jehovah grant you that ye may find a resting-place, each one in the house of her husband," i.e., that ye may both be happily married again. She then kissed them, to take leave of them (vid., <a href="/genesis/31-28.htm">Genesis 31:28</a>). The daughters-in-law, however, began to weep aloud, and said, "We will return with thee to thy people" &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before a direct statement serves to strengthen it, and is almost equivalent to a positive assurance. </body></html>
