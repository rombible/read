When death comes into a family, it ought to reform what is amiss there. Earth is made bitter to us, that heaven may be made dear. Naomi seems to have been a person of faith and piety. She dismissed her daughters-in-law with prayer. It is very proper for friends, when they part, to part with them thus part in love. Did Naomi do well, to discourage her daughters from going with her, when she might save them from the idolatry of Moab, and bring them to the faith and worship of the God of Israel? Naomi, no doubt, desired to do that; but if they went with her, she would not have them to go upon her account. Those that take upon them a profession of religion only to oblige their friends, or for the sake of company, will be converts of small value. If they did come with her, she would have them make it their deliberate choice, and sit down first and count the cost, as it concerns those to do who make a profession of religion. And more desire rest in the house of a husband, or some wordly settlement or earthly satisfaction, than the rest to which Christ invites our souls; therefore when tried they will depart from Christ, though perhaps with some sorrow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See marginal references and notes.

The arguments of Naomi prevailed with Orpah, who returned to her people and her gods. But Ruth clave unto her; and even in the pages of Sterne, that great master of pathos, there is nothing which so calls forth the sensibilities of the reader as the simple effusion he has borrowed from Scripture&#8212;of Ruth to her mother-in-law [Chalmers].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Would ye stay for them from having husbands?</span> it is unreasonable for me to expect it, or for you to perform it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For your sakes; </span> that you are left without the comfort of husbands or children; that I must part with such dear and affectionate daughters; and that my circumstances are such that I cannot invite nor encourage you to go along with me.

It is not to be thought that they would tarry till she was married and had children, and then till these infants were grown up to men's estate, and be marriageable; for though Tamar tarried for Shelah, yet he was born, and of some years of age, though not a grown man, <a href="/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>. <p>would ye stay for them from having husbands? they were young widows, and it was fit they should marry again; and it could not be imagined that they would deny themselves having husbands, in expectation of any sons of her's: <p>nay, my daughters; I am well satisfied you will never tarry for them, nor deprive yourselves of such a benefit; it is unreasonable to suppose it: <p>for it grieveth me much for your sakes; that she could be of no manner of service to them, either to give them husbands, or to support and maintain them, should they go with her; or "I have exceedingly more bitterness than you" (d); her condition and circumstances were much worse than theirs; for though they had lost their husbands, she had lost both husband and children: or it was more bitter and grievous to her to be separated from them, than it was for them to be separated from her; her affection to them was as strong, or stronger than theirs to her; or they had friends in their own country that would be kind to them, but as for her, she was in deep poverty and distress, and when she came into her own country, knew not that she had any friends left to take any notice of her: <p>that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me; in taking away her husband and children, and reducing her to a low estate, penniless and friendless; so poor, as it appears, that her daughter-in-law, when come to the land of Canaan, was obliged to glean for the livelihood of them both, as in the next chapter. <p>(d)    "amaritudo mihi (est) valde prae nobis", Montanus, Rambachius; so Pagninus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Drusius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/ruth/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">would ye therefore tarry till they were grown?</span>] The narrative in Genesis 38. shews that the custom of levirate marriage was presupposed for the patriarchal age, but in a more primitive form than that of the modified law in Deuteronomy 25. According to Genesis 38. a son, though not of marriageable age, is bound by a positive requirement of the divine will to marry his brother’s widow, and she must remain a widow <span class="ital">till he be grown up</span> (ib. <span class="ital"><a href="/ruth/1-11.htm" title="And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?">Ruth 1:11</a></span>). The identity of the latter expression with that in the present verse seems to imply a reminiscence of the patriarchal narrative. But Naomi’s imaginary sons, the offspring of an impossible second marriage, would be half-brothers to Mahlon and Chilion; and there is nothing to shew that a levirate marriage was customary in such a case. Moreover, the object of this kind of marriage was to prevent the extinction of a family and the transference of the family property into the hands of strangers. As a matter of fact, however, Naomi is not thinking of this at all; she is not lamenting that her sons died without children, but that Ruth and Orpah have lost their husbands; her one anxiety is for the future welfare of her daughters in law. Hence, though her language is coloured by a reference to a well-known social institution, the reference is not exact, not intended to be taken literally.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is noticeable that several words in this verse point to the post-exilic date of the writer: <span class="ital">therefore</span> is represented by a pure Aramaic word, <a href="/daniel/2-6.htm" title="But if you show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.">Daniel 2:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-9.htm" title="But if you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof.">Daniel 2:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-27.htm" title="Why, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility.">Daniel 4:27</a> [Aram. 24]; <span class="ital">tarry</span>, again in <a href="/esther/9-1.htm" title="Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)">Esther 9:1</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-166.htm" title="LORD, I have hoped for your salvation, and done your commandments.">Psalm 119:166</a> (‘hoped’); <span class="ital">stay</span>, lit. <span class="ital">be restrained, shut up</span>, only here in the O.

The rendering in the marg. means, ‘You can go back and marry again; a worse lot is in store for me, I must remain a solitary.’ The rendering of the text is to be preferred as more in accordance with Naomi’s unselfish feeling.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the loss of her husband and her two sons, Naomi rose up out of the fields of Moab to return into the land of Judah, as she had heard that Jehovah had visited His people, i.e., had turned His favour towards them again to give them bread. From the place where she had lived Naomi went forth, along with her two daughters-in-law. These three went on the way to return to the land of Judah. The expression "to return," if taken strictly, only applies to Naomi, who really returned to Judah, whilst her daughters-in-law simply wished to accompany her thither. </body></html>
