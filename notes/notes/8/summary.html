In the providential plan of God Ruth meets and marries Boaz, a godly man from the tribe of Judah, which couple will later become the great grandparents of King David himself.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">HOW ON EARTH DID A PAGAN WIDOW GET A BOOK IN THE BIBLE NAMED AFTER HER?<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Here is the thrilling story.

The others are Tamar (Mt. 1:3), Rahab (1:5), and Bathsheba (1:6). Ruth can also be looked upon as the third of three Old Testament women who foreshadow Christ and his church in the New Testament. The first two are Eve (Gen. 2), and Rebekah (Gen. 24).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Ruth provides a marvelous illustration of redemption. The law made provision for women who, due to the death of their husband, were left without heirs and faced with the loss of their property. Both heirs (Deut. 25:5-10) and property (Lev. 25:25-28) were to be secured by a “close relative,” or “kinsman redeemer” (Hebrew <i>goel,</i> 2:20; 3:9, 12-13; 4:1, 3, 6, 8, 14). This law sanctioned the ancient custom of <i>levirate</i> or “brother-in-law” marriage. Gen. 38:1-10 records an incident in which the custom was disregarded; the story of Ruth illustrates its proper application. The kinsman redeemer had to meet three qualifications:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> He had to be a blood relative.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> He had to be willing to redeem.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> He had to be able to pay the redemption price. The kinsman redeemer is a beautiful picture of Christ, who met all these qualifications (Gal. 4:4-5; Eph. 1:7; Heb. 2:14-15; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> This story records the first of five all-important trips to the little city of Bethlehem. The <i>first</i> resulted in the marriage of Ruth to Boaz. The <i>second</i> occurred when Samuel went to Bethlehem to anoint David as king (2 Sam. 16:1-3). The <i>third</i> took place when Joseph and Mary left Nazareth for Bethlehem (Lk. 2:1-7). The <i>fourth</i> and <i>fifth</i> transpired at the visit of some shepherds and wise men (Lk. 2:15-16; Mt. 2:8-11).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> Some of the Scripture’s most beautiful words of love and devotion are found in Ruth: <i>“And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me”</i> (1:16-17).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> Even though the events in Ruth occur during the Judges period, it is in stark contrast to that depressing and depraved era. It is, in fact, like a pure lily gloating on a stagnant pond.<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> Instead of bloody battlefields, we read of blooming harvest fields. In place of the soldier’s shout there is the farmer’s song. The story progresses from a famine, to a funeral, to a field, and finally, to a firstborn.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>Genesis:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Genesis, like Ruth, contains examples of God’s providence. What at first seems to be coincidence often turns out to be God’s plan. Joseph happened to be in the right place at the right time in Egypt, as did the servant of Abraham in Gen. 24.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Jacob’s statement of despair in Genesis can be compared to that of Naomi’s in Ruth. Note: <u>Jacob’s </u>statement: <i>“All these things are against me”</i> (Gen. 42:36). <u>Naomi’s</u> statement: <i>“The hand of the Lord is gone out against me”</i> (Ruth 1:13).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>Matthew:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The book of Ruth closes with a genealogy, while the book of Matthew opens with one.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both genealogies refer to Ruth, her husband Boaz, her son Obed, grandson Jesse, and great grandson David (Ruth 4:21, 22; Mt. 1:5-6).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Titles for and Types of Jesus</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> The Almighty (1:21)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Kinsman Redeemer (2:1)<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> The Lord God of Israel (2:12)<p class="spc"></p></body></html>
