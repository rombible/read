It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blow ye the trumpet - The trumpet was accustomed to sound in Zion, only for religious uses; to call together the congregations for holy meetings, to usher in the beginnings of their months and their solemn days with festival gladness. Now in Zion itself, the stronghold of the kingdom, the Holy City, the place which God chose to put His Name there, which He had promised to establish, the trumpet was to be used, only for sounds of alarm and fear. Alarm could not penetrate there, without having pervaded the whole land. With it, the whole human hope of Judah was gone.<p>Sound an alarm in My holy mountain - He repeats the warning in varied expressions, in order the more to impress people's hearts and to stir them to repentance. Even "the holy mountain" of God was to echo with alarms; the holiness, once bestowed upon it, was to be no security against the judgments of God; yea, in it rather were those judgments to begin. So Peter saith, "The time is come, that judgment must begin at the house of God" <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>. The alarm being blown in Zion, terror was to spread to all the inhabitants of the land, who were, in fear, to repent. The Church of Christ is foretold in prophecy under the names of "Zion" and of the holy "mountain." It is the "stone cut out without hands, which became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth" <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34-35</a>. Of it, it is said, "Come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob!" <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>. And Paul says, "ye are come unto mount Zion and unto the city of the living God" <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>. The words then are a rule for all times. The judgments predicted by Joel represent all judgments unto the end; the conduct, prescribed on their approach, is a pattern to the Church at all times. : "In this mountain we must wail, considering the failure of the faithful, in which, "iniquity abounding, charity waxeth cold." For now (1450 a.d.) the state of the Church is so sunken, and you may see so great misery in her from the most evil conversation of many, that one who burns with zeal for God, and truly loveth his brethren, must say with Jeremiah, "Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach" <a href="/jeremiah/14-17.htm">Jeremiah 14:17</a>.<p>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble - o: "We should be troubled when we hear the words of God, rebuking, threatening, avenging, as Jeremiah saith, 'my heart within me is broken, all my bones shake, because of the Lord and because of the words of His holiness' <a href="/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>. Good is the trouble which people, weighing their sins, are shaken with fear and trembling, and repent."<p>For the Day of the Lord is at hand - "The Day of the Lord" is any day in which He avengeth sin, any day of Judgment, in the course of His Providence or at the end; the day of Jerusalem from the Chaldees or Romans, the day of antichrist, the day of general or particular judgment, of which James says, "The coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Behold the Judge standeth before the door" <a href="//biblehub.com/james/5-8.htm">James 5:8-9</a>. : "Well is that called "the day of the Lord," in that, by the divine appointment, it avengeth the wrongs done to the Lord through the disobedience of His people." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Joe 2:1-32.

The <span class="accented">shophar</span>, or far-sounding horn, and probably the <span class="accented">chatsoterah</span>, the <span class="accented">hazar</span> or silver trumpet, were called into requisition. The priests are urged with great vehemence, as <span class="accented">tiqu shophar</span> and <span class="accented">hariu</span> imply, to apprise the people that the day of Jehovah's terrible judgment was near at hand, and to prepare for it. This alarm was to be sounded from Zion, the dry or sunny hill, the holy moun-rain. The noun <span class="accented">qadosh</span> like <span class="accented">tsadiq</span>, is applied to persons, therefore the noun <span class="accented">qodshe</span> is used. It rose to an elevation of 2539 feet above the level of the Mediterranean Sea. It was the place of the ark in David's day, and so of the visible symbol of the Divine presence, and therefore the holy mountain, though subsequently Moriah was chosen as the temple-hill<span class="cmt_word">. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand.</span> The effect here precedes the cause, as if what is upper. most in the heart comes first to the lips; while the abruptness may, perhaps, express the excitement and intensity of feeling. But how could the Lord's day be said to have come (<span class="accented">ba</span> is perfect), and yet to be near at hand? Hengstenberg replies that, in the intuition of the prophet, it had already come, though in reality it was only drawing near. Keil's solution of the difficulty is more satisfactory: every particular judgment that takes place in the history of God's kingdom is the day of the Lord, and yet only approaching as far as the complete fulfilment was concerned. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From these judgments Israel and Judah will not be set free, until in their distress they seek their God. This thought is expanded in the next strophe (<a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-11.htm">Hosea 5:11-15</a>). <a href="/hosea/5-11.htm">Hosea 5:11</a>. "Ephraim is oppressed, broken in pieces by the judgment; for it has wished, has gone according to statute." By the participles &#8219;a&#770;shu&#772;q and ra&#770;tsu&#772;ts, the calamity is represented as a lasting condition, which the prophet saw in the spirit as having already begun. The two words are connected together even in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, to indicate the complete subjection of Israel to the power and oppression of its foes, as a punishment for falling away from the Lord. Retsuts mishpa&#770;t does not mean "of broken right," or "injured in its right" (Ewald and Hitzig), but "broken in pieces by the judgment" (of God), with a genitivum efficientis, like mukke&#772;h Elo&#772;h&#305;&#772;m in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>. For it liked to walk according to statute. For &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; compare <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a> and <a href="/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>. Tsav is a human statute; it stands both here and in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm">Isaiah 28:13</a>, the only other passages in which it occurs, as an antithesis to the word or commandment of God. The statute intended is the one which the kingdom of Israel upheld from beginning to end, viz., the worship of the calves, that root of all the sins, which brought about the dissolution and ruin of the kingdom. </body></html>
