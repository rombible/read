St. Peter’s quotation and application of it in the Acts is its commentary. “Afterward “—LXX., after these things becomes in the apostle’s mouth—“in the last days”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the Christian dispensation, when, after the punishment of the Jews by the heathen, their king came—“my Spirit”—St. Peter renders “of my spirit,” after the LXX., indicating the gifts and influences of the Holy Ghost—“upon all flesh”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> without distinction of race or person—“they of the circumcision were astonished because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.” The outward manifestation of these gifts, as shown on the Day of Pentecost, in accordance with this prediction, was gradually withdrawn from the Church; the reality remains.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/joel/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:...">Joel 2:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">And it shall come to pass afterward </span>— Some versions begin the third chapter with this verse; and indeed the subject which is begun here is of so different a nature from what goes before, that it seems evident a new chapter ought to be begun here. The Jewish Rabbi Kimchi says here, that the expression <span class="ital">afterward </span>signifies the same as <span class="ital">in the latter days, </span><a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>, and that whenever the words occur, they denote the times of the Messiah; and therefore he refers this prophecy to his days, and makes it descriptive of the event which is foretold <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm" title="They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Isaiah 11:9</a>, <span class="ital">The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord. </span>This is unquestionably the true meaning of it, and thus it is explained by St. Peter, <a href="/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>. “And though the things here prophesied of were not to happen till several ages afterward, yet was the prophecy highly proper to encourage the minds of the pious Jews; as it was an assurance to them that, let them be brought ever so low by this or any other calamity, yet God would preserve them a people, till all the promises made to their forefathers should be actually accomplished; and especially till the Messiah should come, under whom the knowledge of God should spread itself among all the nations of the earth, and the gifts of the Spirit of God should be poured out in a much more abundant manner than ever they were before:” see Chandler. <span class="ital">I will pour out my Spirit — </span>In extraordinary gifts on the first preachers of the gospel, and in various graces on all believers; <span class="ital">upon all flesh — </span>Upon believing Gentiles, as well as believing Jews. In former times those gifts were confined to one particular nation, but now they shall be extended to those of all nations that will apply unto God for them through faith in the Messiah. The plentiful effusion of the Holy Spirit is often represented by the prophets as the peculiar character of the gospel state, and is elsewhere compared to the pouring out of waters upon the thirsty ground, and thereby rendering it fruitful: see the passages referred to in the margin, and compare them with <a href="/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>. That this prophecy was in a great measure fulfilled in the days of the apostles and first messengers of the Lord Jesus, we have abundant proof from the Acts of the Apostles and the epistles of the New Testament. We need not, however, confine this prophecy to those early times, but, since many prophecies have gradual completions, we may understand this as implying that there shall be another remarkable effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the Jews, in order to their conversion in the latter times of the world. This exposition, which is favoured by some expressions in this prophecy, renders its connection with the contents of the following chapter more manifest. <span class="ital">And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy — </span>The gift of prophecy was bestowed upon some women under the Old Testament, as upon Miriam, <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>; upon Deborah, <a href="/judges/4-14.htm" title="And Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand: is not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.">Jdg 4:14</a>; and Huldah, <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2 Kings 22:14</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But this gift was more frequently conferred upon that sex in the times of the New Testament. Thus we read of four daughters of Philip the Evangelist who prophesied, <a href="/acts/21-9.htm" title="And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.">Acts 21:9</a>; and church history affords us several other instances; such as Perpetua and Felicitas, who were martyrs for the Christian faith; Potamiena, mentioned by Eusebius, lib. 4. cap. 5, and others. <span class="ital">Your old men shall dream dreams — </span>Divine dreams, either imparting unto them the knowledge of future events, or discovering to them the will of God in other respects. By this method God often made known his will to the patriarchs and prophets, impressing their minds, while they were asleep, with the things he intended to communicate; sometimes directly, without any parabolical representation, which was a pure dream; as to Solomon and others: sometimes under representations and images, which might be a vision and dream mixed, as in the case of Pharaoh, Joseph, Daniel, and others. <span class="ital">Your young men shall see visions — </span>In <span class="ital">visions, </span>distinguished from dreams, the inspired person was awake, but his external senses being bound up, and, as it were, laid in a trance, (see <a href="/numbers/24-4.htm" title="He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:">Numbers 24:4</a>,) he had a distinct knowledge of the things revealed to him, and that sometimes accompanied with external representations: such was that vision of St. Peter’s, mentioned <a href="/acts/10-11.htm" title="And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:">Acts 10:11</a>. And in this way St. John seems to have received all his revelations. From <span class="ital">visions </span>being applied to <span class="ital">young men, </span>and <span class="ital">dreams </span>to old men, some have observed that the imagination is stronger in those that are young than in the old; so that their senses need not be bound up with sleep, in order to make them capable of receiving heavenly visions. <span class="ital">Also upon the servants and upon the handmaids — </span>Even persons of the lowest condition shall be made partakers of the saving graces of the Holy Spirit, and in many instances also of his extraordinary gifts. The poor have the gospel preached to them, and all the blessings of the gospel, whether ordinary or extraordinary, are as free for the poor as the rich, and are more commonly desired and received by them than by the rich.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:28-32 The promise began to be fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out, and it was continued in the converting grace and miraculous gifts conferred on both Jews and Gentiles. The judgments of God upon a sinful world, only go before the judgment of the world in the last day. Calling on God supposes knowledge of him, faith in him, desire toward him, dependence on him, and, as evidence of the sincerity of all this, conscientious obedience to him. Those only shall be delivered in the great day, who are now effectually called from sin to God, from self to Christ, from things below to things above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it shall come to pass afterward - After the punishment of the Jews through the Pagan, and their deliverance; after the Coming of the Teacher of righteousness, was to follow the outpouring of the Spirit of God.<p>I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh - o: "This which He says, "on all flesh," admits of no exception of nations or persons. For before Jesus was glorified, He had poured His Spirit only on the sons of Zion, and out of that nation only were there prophets and wise men. But after He was glorified by His Resurrection and Ascension, He made no difference of Jews and Gentiles, but willed that remission of sins should be preached to all alike."<p>All flesh - is the name of all mankind. So in the time of the flood, it is said "all flesh had corrupted his way: the end of all flesh is come before Me." Moses asks, "who of all flesh hath heard the voice of the Lord God, as we have, and lived?" So in Job; "in whose Hand is the breath of all flesh of man." If He set His heart upon man, if He gather to Himself his spirit and his breath, all flesh shall perish together.

As "all" were to be "one in Christ Jesus" <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, so on all was to be poured the Holy Spirit, the Bond who was to bind all in one. He names our nature from that which is the lowest in it, "the flesh," with the same condescension with which it is said, "The Word was made flesh" , from where we speak of the "Incarnation" of our Blessed Lord, i. e., "His taking on Him our Flesh." He humbled Himself to take our flesh; He came, as our Physician, to heal our flesh, the seat of our concupisceuce. So also God the Holy Spirit vouchsafes to dwell in our flesh, to sanctify it and to heal it. He, whom God saith He will pour out on all flesh, is the Spirit of God, and God. He does not say that He will pour out graces, or gifts, ordinary or extraordinary, influences, communications, or the like.<p>He says, "I will pour out My Spirit;" as Paul says, "know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>. "Ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His" <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9-10</a>. It is said indeed, "on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit," but the gift of the Holy Spirit was the Holy Spirit Himself, as it had been just said, "the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word" <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-45</a>. It is said, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given us" <a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>; but the "Holy Spirit" is first "given," and He poureth out into the soul "the love of God." As God the Word, when He took human nature, came into it personally, so that "the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily in it" <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>; so, really, although not personally, "doth the Holy Spirit, and so the whole Trinity, enter into our mind by sanctification, and dwelleth in it as in His throne."<p>No created being, no Angel, nor Archangel could dwell in the soul. : "God Alone can be poured out into the soul, so as to possess it, enlighten it, teach, kindle, bend, move it as He wills," sanctify, satiate, fill it. And "as God is really present with the blessed, when He sheweth to them His Essence by the beatific vision and light of glory, and communicates it to them, to enjoy and possess; so He, the Same, is also in the holy soul, and thus diffuseth it in His grace, love, and other divine gifts." At the moment of justification, "the Holy Spirit and so the whole Holy Trinity entereth the soul at His temple, sanctifying and as it were dedicating and consecrating it to Himself, and at the same moment of time, although in the order of nature subsequently, He communicates to it His love and grace. Such is the meaning of, "We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him." This is the highest union of God with the holy soul; and greater than this can none be given to any creature, for by it we become "partakers of the divine Nature," as Peter saith <a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>. See here, O Christian, the dignity of the holiness whereunto thou art called and with all zeal follow after, preserve, enlarge it.<p>This His Spirit, God says, "I will pour," i. e., give largely, as though He would empty out Him who is Infinite, so that there should be no measure of His giving, save our capacity of receiving. So He says of converted Israel, "I have poured out My Spirit upon the house of Israel" <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-29.htm">Ezekiel 39:29</a>, and, "I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication" <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>.<p>And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy - This cannot limit what he has said, that God would pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. He gives instances of that out-pouring, in those miraculous gifts, which were at the first to be the tokens and evidence of His inward presence. These gifts were at the first bestowed on the Jews only. The highest were reserved altogether for them. Jews only were employed as Apostles and Evangelists; Jews only wrote, by inspiration of God, the "oracles of God," as the source of the faith of the whole world. : "The Apostles were sons of Israel; the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the other women who abode at the same time and prayed with the Apostles, were daughters. Luke mentions, "All these were persevering with one accord in prayer with the women and Mary the Mother of Jesus, and His brethren." These sons and daughters of the Sons of Zion, having received the Spirit, prophesied, i. e., in divers tongues they spoke of the heavenly mysteries."<p>In the narrower sense of  "foretelling the future, the Apostles, the Blessed Virgin <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>, Zacharias (<a href="/luke/1-67.htm">Luke 1:67</a> ff), and Anna <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-38.htm">Luke 2:38</a>, Elizabeth <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/1-42.htm">Luke 1:42-45</a>, the virgin daughters of Philip <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>, Agabus <a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10-11</a>, John in the Apocalypse," Simeon <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/2-27.htm">Luke 2:27-35</a>, and Paul also oftentimes <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/3-4.htm">2 Timothy 3:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a> prophesied. At Antioch, there were certain "prophets" <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; and "the Holy Spirit in every city witnessed, saying, that bonds and afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem" <a href="/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>. "But it is superfluous," adds Theodoret  after giving some instances, "to set myself to prove the truth of the prophecy. For down to our times also hath this gift been preserved, and there are among the saints, people who have the eye of the mind clear, who foreknow and foretell many of the things which are about to be." So the death of Julian the Apostate, who fell, as it seemed, by a chance wound in war with the Persians was foreseen and foretold ; and Cyprian foretold the day of his own martyrdom and the close of Decian persecution, which ended through the death of the Emperor in a rash advance over a morass, when victory was gained . The stream of prophecy has been traced down through more than four centuries from the Birth of the Redeemer. One of the Bishops of the Council of Nice was gifted with a prophetic spirit .<p>Your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions - "God often attempers Himself and His oracles to the condition of people, and appears to each, as suits his state" <a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10-11</a>. It may then be, that to old men while sleeping by reason of age, He appeared most commonly in dreams; to young men, while watching, in visions. But it is so common in Hebrew, that each part of the verse should be filled up from the other, that perhaps the prophet only means, that their old and young should have dreams and see visions, and both from God. Nor are these the highest of God's revelations; as He says, that to the prophet He would "make" Himself known in a vision and would "speak in a dream," but to Moses "mouth to mouth; even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>.<p>The Apostles also saw waking visions, as Peter at Joppa (<a href="/acts/10-10.htm">Acts 10:10</a> ff; <a href="/acts/11-5.htm">Acts 11:5</a> ff); (and that so frequently, that when the Angel delivered him, he thought that it was one of his accustomed visions <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/12-9.htm">Acts 12:9</a>,) and Paul after his conversion, and calling him to Macedonia; and the Lord appeared unto him in vision at Corinth, revealing to him the conversions which should be worked there, and at Jerusalem foretelling to him the witness he should bear to Him at Rome. In the ship, the Angel of the Lord foretold to him his own safety, and that God had given him all who sailed with him <a href="/acts/9-12.htm">Acts 9:12</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-7</a>, <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>; <a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>; <a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>. Ananias <a href="/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a> and Cornelius <a href="/acts/10-3.htm">Acts 10:3</a> also received revelations through visions. But all these were only revelations of single truths or facts. Of a higher sort seems to be that revelation, whereby our Lord revealed to Paul Himself and His Gospel which Paul was to preach, and "the wisdom of God," and the glories of the world to come, and the conversion of the Gentiles; and when he was "caught up to the third heaven, and abundance of revelations were vouchsafed to him" <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. afterward&#8212;"in the last days" (Isa 2:2) under Messiah after the invasion and deliverance of Israel from the northern army. Having heretofore stated the outward blessings, he now raises their minds to the expectation of extraordinary spiritual blessings, which constitute the true restoration of God's people (Isa 44:3). Fulfilled in earnest (Ac 2:17) on Pentecost; among the Jews and the subsequent election of a people among the Gentiles; hereafter more fully at the restoration of Israel (Isa 54:13; Jer 31:9, 34; Eze 39:29; Zec 12:10) and the consequent conversion of the whole world (Isa 2:2; 11:9; 66:18-23; Mic 5:7; Ro 11:12, 15). As the Jews have been the seedmen of the elect Church gathered out of Jews and Gentiles, the first Gospel preachers being Jews from Jerusalem, so they shall be the harvest men of the coming world-wide Church, to be set up at Messiah's appearing. That the promise is not restricted to the first Pentecost appears from Peter's own words: "The promise is (not only) unto you and to your children, (but also) to all that are afar off (both in space and in time), even as many as the Lord our God shall call" (Ac 2:39). So here "upon all flesh."<p>I will pour out&#8212;under the new covenant: not merely, let fall drops, as under the Old Testament (Joh 7:39).<p>my spirit&#8212;the Spirit "proceeding from the Father and the Son," and at the same time one with the Father and the Son (compare Isa 11:2).<p>sons &#8230; daughters &#8230; old &#8230; young&#8212;not merely on a privileged few (Nu 11:29) as the prophets of the Old Testament, but men of all ages and ranks. See Ac 21:9; 1Co 11:5, as to "daughters," that is, women, prophesying.<p>dreams &#8230; visions&#8212;(Ac 9:10; 16:9). The "dreams" are attributed to the "old men," as more in accordance with their years; "visions" to the "young men," as adapted to their more lively minds. The three modes whereby God revealed His will under the Old Testament (Nu 12:6), "prophecy, dreams, and visions," are here made the symbol of the full manifestation of Himself to all His people, not only in miraculous gifts to some, but by His indwelling Spirit to all in the New Testament (Joh 14:21, 23; 15:15). In Ac 16:9; 18:9, the term used is "vision," though in the night, not a dream. No other dream is mentioned in the New Testament save those given to Joseph in the very beginning of the New Testament, before the full Gospel had come; and to the wife of Pilate, a Gentile (Mt 1:20; 2:13; 27:19). "Prophesying" in the New Testament is applied to all speaking under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, and not merely to foretelling events. All true Christians are "priests" and "ministers" of our God (Isa 61:6), and have the Spirit (Eze 36:26, 27). Besides this, probably, a special gift of prophecy and miracle-working is to be given at or before Messiah's coming again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It shall come to pass, </span> most certainly this shall be done, afterward; in the latter days, after the return out of Babylonish captivity, after the various troubles and salvations by which they may know that I am the Lord, their God in the midst of them, when those wondrous works shall be seconded by the most wonderful of all, the sending the Messiah, in his day and under his kingdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will pour out my Spirit; </span> in large abundant measures will I give my Holy Spirit, which the Messiah exalted shall send, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a></span>; in extraordinary power and gifts in the apostles and first preachers of the gospel, and in ordinary measure and graces to all believers, <span class="bld"><a href="/context/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men....">Ephesians 4:8-11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon all flesh; </span> before these gifts were confined to a few people, to one particular nation, to a very small people; but now they shall be enlarged to all nations, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a> 10:45</span>, to all that believe, all that are regenerate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy:</span> this was in part fulfilled according to the letter in the first days of the gospel; but this promise is rather of a comparative meaning, thus, By pouring out of the Holy Spirit on your sons and your daughters, they shall have as clear and full knowledge of the deep mysteries of God’s law as prophets beforetime had.

This intimates the <span class="accented">time</span> when the promised blessing is to be bestowed, and must be read in the light of New Testament exposition; for Peter, in quoting the words (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>, etc.), varies the prophet's note of time by substituting an explanatory phrase, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in the last days" - an expression which, as is acknowledged, refers to the days of the Messiah or the last days of the old dispensation. The apostle thus defines more closely the somewhat indefinite expression of the Hebrew. After this specification of the time, he proceeds to state the <span class="accented">blessing</span> to be bestowed. <span class="cmt_word">I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh</span>. The word <span class="accented">shaphak</span>, employed by the prophet to express the outpouring of the Spirit, implies the bestowal of the gift in great abundance, as Calvin clearly pointed out: "For <span class="accented">shaphak</span>," he says, "does not mean merely to give in drops, but to pour out in great abundance. But God did net pour out the Holy Spirit so abundantly or copiously under the Law, as he has since the manifestation of Christ." The Spirit was indeed communicated in Old Testament times, but that communication was restricted in two ways in quantity, and in the number of recipients; the former was comparatively scanty and the latter few, whereas the word here applied to its communication implies a rich supply, like a copious rainfall. After the specification of the <span class="accented">time</span>, and the mention of the <span class="accented">blessing</span>, with its implied <span class="accented">plentifulness</span>, comes its <span class="accented">wide diffusion</span>, or general distribution - "all flesh," or "all mankind," as the Hebrew expression denotes; and that without regard to age, or sex, or state. <span class="cmt_word">And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit</span>. Sons and daughters without distinction of sex; old men and young men without reference to age; servants and handmaids without regard to social position. Thus it is with the Spirit of God as with the Son of God, of whom the apostle says, "There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uucircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all." The blessing of salvation through the Son of God and by the Spirit of God is wide as the world in its offer, and free to all who accept it - without national distinction, for there is neither Jew nor Greek; without  social distinction, for there is neither bond nor free; without sexual distinction, for there is neither male nor female; without ceremonial distinction, for there is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision; without intellectual or educational distinction, for the barbarian and even the Scythian, the lowest type of barbarian, are free to share the blessing. The <span class="accented">regain</span> before the "servants" and "handmaids," rendered in the citation by Peter, not as in the LXX. by a simple <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, but by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>, and in the Authorized Version "and also," is an emphatic addition to the previous enumeration, equivalent to "nay more" and implying something extraordinary and unexpected, that not only the weaker sex, but the meanest of both sexes, were to participate in the blessing. "Not a single case," says Keil, "occurs in the whole of the Old Testament of a slave receiving the gift of prophecy." The mode in which spiritual commmunication is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> according to some is that of visions to the young, whose fancy is more vigorous; that of dreams to the old, in the decadence of their mental powers; while to the <span class="accented">sons</span> and daughters the gift is prophesying. Others more correctly <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> understand prophecy as the general term for speaking under the Spirit's influence or instructing by Divine inspiration; while the two forms of prophetic revelation are dreams when the mental "faculties are suspended by natural causes," and visions or trances when "suspended by supernatural causes," the communication in either case being supernatural. This prediction began to be fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Ephraim has become like a simple dove without understanding; they have called Egypt, they are gone to Asshur. <a href="/hosea/7-12.htm">Hosea 7:12</a>. As they go, I spread my net over them; I bring them down like fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, according to the tidings to their assembly." The perfects in <a href="/hosea/7-1.htm">Hosea 7:1</a> describe the conduct of Israel as an accomplished fact, and this is represented by &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; as the necessary consequence of its obstinate impenitence. The point of comparison between Israel and the simple dove, is not that the dove misses its proper dwelling and resting-place, and therefore goes fluttering about (Ewald); nor that, in trying to escape from the hawk, it flies into the net of the bird-catcher (Hitzig); but that when flying about in search of food, it does not observe the net that is spread for it (Rosenmller). &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489; is to be taken as a predicate to Ephraim in spite of the accents, and not to yo&#772;na&#770;h pho&#772;tha&#770;h (a simple dove), since pho&#772;tha&#770;h does not require either strengthening or explaining. Thus does Ephraim seek help from Egypt and Assyria. These words do not refer to the fact that there were two parties in the nation - an Assyrian and an Egyptian. Nor do they mean that the whole nation applied at one time to Egypt to get rid of Asshur, and at another time to Asshur to escape from Egypt. "The situation is rather this: the people being sorely pressed by Asshur, at one time seek help from Egypt against Asshur; whilst at another they try to secure the friendship of the latter" (Hengstenberg, Christology, i. p. 164 transl.). For what threatened Israel was the burden of the "king of princes" (<a href="/hosea/8-10.htm">Hosea 8:10</a>), i.e., the king of Asshur. And this they tried to avert partly by their coquettish arts (<a href="/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a>), and partly by appealing to the help of Egypt; and while doing so, they did not observe that they had fallen into the net of destruction, viz., the power of Assyria. In this net will the Lord entangle them as a punishment. As they go thither, God will spread His net over them like a bird-catcher, and bring them down to the earth like flying birds, i.e., bring them down from the open air, that is to say, from freedom, into the net of captivity, or exile. &#1488;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;, a rare hiphil formation with Yod mobile, as in <a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25</a> (see Ewald, 131, c). "According to the tidings (announcement) to their assembly:" i.e., in accordance with the threatening already contained in the law (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>.; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>.), and repeatedly uttered to the congregation by the prophets, of the judgments that should fall upon the rebellious, which threatening would now be fulfilled upon Ephraim. </body></html>
