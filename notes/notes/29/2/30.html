It principally and evidently refers to the destruction of the city and temple of Jerusalem, and the desolation of Judea by the Romans; a judgment justly inflicted upon the Jewish nation for their rejecting and crucifying their Messiah, resisting the Holy Spirit, contemning the gospel and the means of grace connected therewith, and persecuting the apostles and God’s other messengers. Thus Malachi, after he had foretold the coming of the Messiah, preceded by that of his forerunner John the Baptist, (chap. <a href="/joel/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,">Joel 3:1</a>,) immediately adds, that his coming should be attended with terrible judgments upon the disobedient, <a href="/context/joel/3-2.htm" title="I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land....">Joel 3:2-5</a>, and chap. 4:1. The prophet in the next clause predicts also the extraordinary signs which were to be forerunners of that destruction, by <span class="ital">blood, </span>and <span class="ital">fire, </span>and <span class="ital">pillars of smoke, </span>meaning probably the great slaughter which should be made of men, and the burning of the towns and cities of Judea, events which preceded that last and finishing stroke of the divine vengeance, the destruction of Jerusalem. He may also refer, perhaps, in the last expression, to the comet which hung over their city, and the fearful sights seen in the air some time before, which are mentioned by Josephus, and were foretold by Christ, <a href="/luke/21-11.htm" title="And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.">Luke 21:11</a>; and of which the reader may see an account in the note on <a href="/isaiah/66-6.htm" title="A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that renders recompense to his enemies.">Isaiah 66:6</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:28-32 The promise began to be fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out, and it was continued in the converting grace and miraculous gifts conferred on both Jews and Gentiles. The judgments of God upon a sinful world, only go before the judgment of the world in the last day. Calling on God supposes knowledge of him, faith in him, desire toward him, dependence on him, and, as evidence of the sincerity of all this, conscientious obedience to him. Those only shall be delivered in the great day, who are now effectually called from sin to God, from self to Christ, from things below to things above.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will shew wonders - Each revelation of God prepares the way for another, until that last revelation of His love and of His wrath in the Great Day. In delivering His people from Egypt, "the Lord shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt <a href="/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>. Here, in allusion to it, He says, in the same words, of the new revelation, "I will shew," or "give, wonders, or wondrous signs," (as the word includes both) wonders beyond the course and order of nature, and portending other dispensations of God, of joy to His faithful, terror to His enemies. As when Israel came out of Egypt, "the pillar of the cloud was a cloud and darkness to the camp of the Egyptians," but "gave light by night" to the "camp of Israel" <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-20</a>, so all God's workings are light and darkness at once, according as people are, who see them or to whom they come. These wonders in heaven and earth "began in" the First Coming and "Passion of Christ, grew in the destruction of Jerusalem, but shall be perfectly fulfilled toward the end of the world, before the final Judgment, and the destruction of the Universe." At the birth of Christ, there was "the star" which appeared unto the wise men, "and the multitude of the heavenly host," whom the shepherds saw. At His Atoning Death, "the sun was darkened," there was the three hours' darkness over the whole land; and on earth "the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened" <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44-45</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51-52</a> : and the Blood and water issued from the Saviour's side. After His Resurrection, there was the vision of Angels, terrible to the soldiers who watched the sepulchre, comforting to the women who sought to honor Jesus. His Resurrection was a sign on earth, His Ascension in earth and heaven. But our Lord speaks of signs both in earth and heaven, as well before the destruction of Jerusalem, as before His second Coming.<p>With regard to the details, it seems probable that this is an instance of what we may call an inverted parallelism, that having mentioned generally that God would give "signs in (1) heaven and (2) earth," the prophet first instances the "signs in earth," and then those "in heaven." A very intellectual Jewish expositor  has suggested this, and certainly it is frequent enough to be, in conciser forms, one of the idioms of the sacred language. In such case, "the blood and fire and pillars of smoke, will be signs in earth; the turning of the sun into darkness and the moon into blood will be signs in heaven." When fortelling the destruction of Jerusalem, the Day of vengeance, which fell with such accumulated horror on the devoted city, and has for these 1800 years dispersed the people of Israel to the four winds, our Lord mentions first the signs on earth, then those in heaven. "Nation shall arise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/21-10.htm">Luke 21:10-11</a>. Before the Day of Judgment our Lord also speaks of both <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25-26</a>;<p>(1) "there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars;<p>(2) and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; people's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken."<p>The Jewish historian relates signs both in heaven and in earth, before the destruction of Jerusalem. : "A star stood like a sword over Jerusalem;" "a light which, when the people were assembled at the Passover at 9 at night, shone so brightly around the altar and the temple, that it seemed like bright day, and this for half an hour; the eastern door of the temple, which 20 men scarcely shut at eventide, stayed with iron-bound bars and very deep bolts let down into the threshhold of one solid stone, was seen at 6 o'clock at night to open of its own accord; chariots and armed troops were seen along the whole country, coursing through the clouds, encircling the cities; at the feast of Pentecost, the priests entering the temple by night, as their wont was for worship, first perceived a great movement and sound, and then a multitudinous voice, 'Let us depart hence.'" These signs were authenticated by the multitude or character of those who witnessed them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30, 31. As Messiah's manifestation is full of joy to believers, so it has an aspect of wrath to unbelievers, which is represented here. Thus when the Jews received Him not in His coming of grace, He came in judgment on Jerusalem. Physical prodigies, massacres, and conflagrations preceded its destruction [Josephus, Wars of the Jews]. To these the language here may allude; but the figures chiefly symbolize political revolutions and changes in the ruling powers of the world, prognosticated by previous disasters (Am 8:9; Mt 24:29; Lu 21:25-27), and convulsions such as preceded the overthrow of the Jewish polity. Such shall probably occur in a more appalling degree before the final destruction of the ungodly world ("the great and terrible day of Jehovah," compare Mal 4:5), of which Jerusalem's overthrow is the type and earnest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I will show wonders; </span> as he promiseth such grace to believers, so he warneth them that they should not be surprised with those alarming prodigies which in those days God would show, which would usher in the hard times that should be chastisement to the best, and destruction to the worst: whoso will read and observe what historians and naturalists report of those times will see this fulfilled in the very letter, and <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/24-7.htm" title="For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.">Matthew 24:7</a>,29 Mr 13:24 <a href="/luke/21-11.htm" title="And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.">Luke 21:11</a>,25</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the heavens and in the earth; </span> above men, and under their feet; all which signs are particularly named, and first the signs on the earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Blood; </span> possibly eruption of blood, as some fountains have been reported to have run with blood, and these prefiguring the great effusion of blood by the sword and wars following, or by antichristian persecutions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fire; </span> either breaking out of the earth, or else unusual lightnings, and unparalleled flashes of lightnings in the lower region of the air, setting many things on fire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Pillars of smoke; </span> from those burning things fired by lightnings, or by extraordinary flashes, a smoke shall go up like a pillar.

Along with the wonderful distribution of gifts and graces at the Day of Pentecost, attention is directed to portents of destructive visitation; after a dispensation of mercy follows a dispensation of wrath; mercy and judgment thus succeed each other in the providence of God. The visitation of mercy may, by way of contrast, suggest that of judgment; or the connection of this and the following verses with the preceding may be the plague of the locusts, the mind passing on from that visitation to the visitation at the destruction of Jerusalem, as also to that which shall take place at the judgment of the last day. Our Lord, in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, seems to mingle the portents which were to precede the destruction of Jerusalem with those that shall usher in the judgment-day. There may Be some doubt whether the expressions before us are to Be understood literally or figuratively. In either case coming events were casting their shadows before; and the appearances enumerated, whether taken in a literal or figurative sense, were symbolical of great revolutionary changes. The expressions themselves reflect the miracles of Egypt. Of the wonders on earth which the prophet first mentions, the <span class="accented">blood</span> brings to mind the changing of the Nile-water into blood; the <span class="accented">fire</span> reminds us of the fire that ran along upon the ground, mingled with the hail; while the <span class="accented">smoke</span> carries back our thoughts to the wonderful events of the wilderness and of the encampment at Sinai, when, as Jehovah descended upon the mount, "Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Woe to them! for they have flown from me; devastation to them! for they have fallen away from me. I would redeem them, but they speak lies concerning me. <a href="/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>. They did not cry to me in their heart, but howl upon their beds; they crowd together for corn and new wine, and depart against me." The Lord, thinking of the chastisement, exclaims, Woe to them, because they have fled from Him! Na&#770;dad, which is applied to the flying of birds, points back to the figures employed in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>, <a href="/hosea/7-12.htm">Hosea 7:12</a>. Sho&#772;d, used as an exclamation, gives the literal explanation of 'o&#772;i (woe). The imperfect 'ephde&#772;m cannot be taken as referring to the redemption out of Egypt, because it does not stand for the preterite. It is rather voluntative or optative. "I would (should like to) redeem them (still); but they say I cannot and will not do it." These are the lies which they utter concerning Jehovah, partly with their mouths and partly by their actions, namely, in the fact that they do not seek help from Him, as is explained in <a href="/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>. They cry to the Lord; yet it does not come from the heart, but (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; after &#1500;&#1488;) they howl (&#1497;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, cf. Ges. 70, 2, note) upon their beds, in unbelieving despair at the distress that has come upon them. What follows points to this. Hithgo&#772;re&#772;r, to assemble, to crowd together (<a href="/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-4.htm">Psalm 59:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-15.htm">Isaiah 54:15</a>); here to gather in troops or crowd together for corn and new wine, because their only desire is to fill their belly. Thus they depart from God. The construction of &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with &#1489;, instead of with &#1502;&#1503; or &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;, is a pregnant one: to depart and turn against God. </body></html>
