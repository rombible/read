It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And rend your hearts and not your garments - that is, "not your garments only" (see the note at <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). The rending of the clothes was an expression of extraordinary uncontrollable emotion, chiefly of grief, of terror, or of horror. At least, in Holy Scripture it is not mentioned as a part of ordinary mourning, but only upon some sudden overpowering grief, whether public or private . It was not used on occasion of death, unless there were something very grievous about its circumstances. At times it was used as an outward expression, one of deep grief, as when the leper was commanded to keep his clothes rent <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>, or when David, to express his abhorrence at the murder of Abner, commanded "all the people with him, rend your clothes;" Ahab used it, with fasting and haircloth, on God's sentence by Elijah and obtained a mitigation of the temporal punishment of his sin; Jeremiah marvels that neither "the king," Jehoiakim, "nor any of his servants, rent their garments" <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-24.htm">Jeremiah 36:24</a>, on reading the roll containing the woes which God had by him pronounced against Judah. The holy garments of the priests were on no occasion to be rent <a href="/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; (probably because the wholeness was a symbol of perfection, from where care was to be taken that the ephod should not accidentally be torn <a href="/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-23.htm">Exodus 39:23</a>) so that the act of Caiaphas was the greater hypocrisy <a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>; <a href="/mark/14-63.htm">Mark 14:63</a>.<p>He used it probably to impress his own blasphemous accusation on the people, as for a good end, the Apostles Paul and Barnabas rent their <a href="/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a> clothes, when they heard that, after the cure of the impotent man, the priest of Jupiter with the people would have done sacrifice unto them. Since then apostles used this act, Joel plainly doth not forbid the use of such outward behavior, by which their repentance might be expressed, but only requires that it be done not in outward show only, but accompanied with the inward affections. : "The Jews are bidden then to rend their hearts rather than their garments, and to set the truth of repentance in what is inward, rather than in what is outward." But since the rending of the garments was the outward sign of very vehement grief, it was no commonplace superficial sorrow, which the prophet enjoined, but one which should pierce and rend the inmost soul, and empty it of its sins and its love for sin. : Any very grieving thing is said to cut one's heart, to "cut him to the heart."<p>A truly penitent heart is called a "broken and a contrite heart." Such a penitent rends and "rips up by a narrow search the recesses of the heart, to discover the abominations thereof," and pours out before God "the diseased and perilous stuff" pent up and festering there, "expels the evil thoughts lodged in it, and opens it in all things to the reception of divine grace. This rending is no other than the spiritual circumcision to which Moses exhorts. Whence of the Jews, not thus rent in heart, it is written in Jeremiah, 'All the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart' <a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>. This rending then is the casting out of the sins and passions."<p>And turn unto the Lord your God - God owns Himself as still their God, although they had turned and were gone from Him in sin and were alienated from Him. To Him, the true, Unchangeable God, if they returned, they would find Him still "their God." "Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding," God saith by Jeremiah; "Behold, Israel answers, we come unto Thee, for Thou art the Lord our God" <a href="/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a>.<p>For He is very gracious and very merciful - Both these words are intensive. All the words, "very gracious, very merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness," are the same and in the same order as in that revelation to Moses, when, on the renewal of the two tables of the law, "the Lord descended in the cloud and proclaimed the name of the Lord" <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5-6</a>). The words are frequently repeated, showing how deeply that revelation sunk in the pious minds of Israel. They are, in part, pleaded to God by Moses himself <a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; David, at one time, pleaded them all to God <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/85-1.htm">Psalm 85:1-13</a> :15; elsewhere he repeats them of God, as in this place <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-8.htm">Psalm 145:8</a>. Nehemiah, in praising God for His forgiving mercies, prefixes the title, "God of pardons" <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>, and adds, "and Thou forsakedst them not;" as Joel, for the special object here, adds, "and repenteth Him of the evil." A Psalmist, and Hezekiah in his message to Isaiah, and Nehemiah in the course of that same prayer, repeat the two words of intense mercy, "very gracious and very merciful" <a href="/psalms/111-4.htm">Psalm 111:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-9.htm">2 Chronicles 30:9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-31.htm">Nehemiah 9:31</a>, which are used of God only, except once by that same Psalmist <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>, with the express object of showing how the good man conformeth himself to God. The word "very gracious" expresses God's free love, whereby He sheweth Himself good to us; "very merciful" expresses the tender yearning of His love over our miseries (see the note at <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>); "great kindness," expresses God's tender love, as love.<p>He first says, that God is "slow to anger" or "long-suffering," enduring long the wickedness and rebellion of man, and waiting patiently for the conversion and repentance of sinners. Then he adds, that God is "abundant in kindness," having manifold resources and expedients of His tender love, whereby to win them to repentance. Lastly He is "repentant of the evil." The evil which lie foretells, and at last inflicts, is (so to speak) against His Will, "Who willeth not that any should perish," and, therefore, on the first tokens of repentance "He repenteth Him of the evil," and doeth it not.<p>The words rendered, "of great kindness," are better rendered elsewhere, "abundant, plenteous in goodness, mercy" <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>. Although the mercy of God is in itself one and simple, yet it is called abundant on account of its divers effects. For God knoweth how in a thousand ways to succor His own. Whence the Psalmist prays, "According to the multitude of Thy mercies, turn Thou unto me" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/25-16.htm">Psalm 25:16</a>.

Which latter used to be done in times of distress, either private or public, and as a token of grief and sorrow, <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; nor was it criminal or unlawful, the apostles themselves used it, <a href="/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a>; nor is it absolutely forbidden here, only comparatively, that they should rend their hearts rather than their garments; or not their garments only, but their hearts also; in like sense as the words in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; are to be taken as rending garments was only an external token of sorrow and might be done hypocritically. Where no true repentance was, the Lord calls for that, rather than the other; and that they would show contrition of heart and brokenness of spirit under a sense of sin, and in the view of pardoning grace and mercy; which is here held forth, to influence godly sorrow and evangelical repentance; the acts of which, flowing from faith in Christ are much more acceptable to the Lord than any outward expressions of grief; see <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>.

The evil meant is that which He has threatened to bring upon an individual or a nation. The implicit condition of Jehovah’s repentance is, of course, the prior repentance of the individual or nation concerned, and their unreserved abandonment of their evil way: see <a href="/context/jeremiah/18-5.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Jeremiah 18:5-12</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm" title="And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did it not.">Jonah 3:10</a>.

Where there is real contrition of spirit because of sin, outward manifestations are both suitable and proper, though not by way of display or for sake of ostentation. But they were reminded, on the other hand, that mere outward manifestations avail nothing unless there also exist the deep inward feelings which are in harmony with and naturally underlie those manifestations. Out of such inward feelings those outward expressions properly originate; hence, after the exhortation to fasting and weeping and mourning, it is added, "Rend your heart, and not your garments." To rend the garments, among the Jews, was a token of great grief, and imported that the individual who did so was overwhelmed with excessive sorrow, or had encountered some terrible calamity. Thus we read of Jacob, on receiving his son Joseph's coat of many colours, rending his clothes, putting sackcloth on his loins, and mourning for his son many days (comp. also <a href="/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a>). In these instances the sorrow was deep and genuine and bitter. It was possible, however, to exhibit the external signs of grief without any such corresponding inward feeling of sorrow; just as it is still possible for men to draw near to God with their lips while the heart is far from him. To prevent such hypocritical pretence they are commanded to rend their hearts, and not their garments only. There was no impropriety in rending their garments in token of great grief for sin and of great indignation against themselves for their folly, but the command imports that they were not to rest in the  outward sign without the reality of the thing signified<span class="cmt_word">. For he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</span> To the exhortation he subjoins the encouraging manifestation of the Divine character with which God, ages before, had favoured Moses, substituting for "truth" the trait of character best suited to the present emergency. He is not an absolute God or an inexorable God, but their covenant God and Father who invites them even to himself, against whom they had so heinously sinned and whom they had so grievously offended. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet cites a few examples in proof of this faithlessness in the two following verses. <a href="/hosea/6-8.htm">Hosea 6:8</a>. "Gilead is a city of evil-doers, trodden with blood. <a href="/hosea/6-9.htm">Hosea 6:9</a>. And like the lurking of the men of the gangs is the covenant of the priests; along the way they murder even to Sichem: yea, they have committed infamy." Gilead is not a city, for no such city is mentioned in the Old Testament, and its existence cannot be proved from <a href="/judges/12-7.htm">Judges 12:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>, any more than from <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-48.htm">Genesis 31:48-49</a>,<p>(Note: The statement of the Onomast. (s.v. &#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;), that there is also a city called Galaad, situated in the mountain which Galaad the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, took for the Amorite, and that of Jerome, "from which mountain the city built in it derived its name, viz., that which was taken," etc., furnish no proof of the existence of a city called Gilead in the time of the Israelites; since Eusebius and Jerome have merely inferred the existence of such a city from statements in the Old Testament, more especially from the passage quoted by them just before, viz., <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a>, Galaad tu mihi initium Libani, taken in connection with <a href="/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39</a> -43, as the words "which Gilead took" clearly prove. And with regard to the ruined cities Jelaad and Jelaud, which are situated, according to Burckhardt (pp. 599, 600), upon the mountain called Jebel Jelaad or Jelaud, it is not known that they date from antiquity at all. Burckhardt gives no description of them, and does not even appear to have visited the ruins.)<p>but it is the name of a district, as it is everywhere else; and here in all probability it stands, as it very frequently does, for the whole of the land of Israel to the east of the Jordan. Hosea calls Gilead a city of evil-doers, as being a rendezvous for wicked men, to express the thought that the whole land was as full of evil-doers as a city is of men. &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;: a denom. of &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, a footstep, signifying marked with traces, full of traces of blood, which are certainly not to be understood as referring to idolatrous sacrifices, as Schmieder imagines, but which point to murder and bloodshed. It is quite as arbitrary, however, on the part of Hitzig to connect it with the murder of Zechariah, or a massacre associated with it, as it is on the part of Jerome and others to refer it to the deeds of blood by which Jehu secured the throne. The bloody deeds of Jehu took place in Jezreel and Samaria (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9-10</a>), and it was only by a false interpretation of the epithet applied to Shallum, viz., Ben-ya&#770;bhe&#772;sh, as signifying citizens of Jabesh, that Hitzig was able to trace a connection between it and Gilead. </body></html>
