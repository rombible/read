Cyril says of them, that while they are breaking their food with their teeth, the noise is like that of flame driven about by the wind. See Bochart on the place. The Baron de Tott, quoted by Harmer, speaking of the clouds of locusts coming from Tartary toward Constantinople, observes, “To the noise of their flight succeeds that of their devouring activity; it resembles the rattling of hailstones, but its consequences are infinitely more destructive. Fire itself eats not so fast, nor is there a vestige of vegetation to be found, when they again take their flight, and go elsewhere to produce like disasters.” <span class="ital">As a strong people set in battle array — </span>Their noise is like that of the shouts of an army going to be engaged.

It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The appearance of them, is as the appearance of horses - "If you carefully consider the head of the locust," says Theodoret, a Bishop in Syria, "you will find it exceedingly like that of a horse." Whence the Arabs, of old  and to this day , say; "In the locust, slight as it is, is the nature of ten of the larger animals, the face of a horse, the eyes of an elephant, the neck of abull, the horns of a deer, the chest of a lion, the belly of a scorpion, the wings of an eagle, the thighs of a camel, the feet of an ostrich, the tail of a serpent." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. appearance &#8230; of horses&#8212;(Re 9:7). Not literal, but figurative locusts. The fifth trumpet, or first woe, in the parallel passage (Re 9:1-11), cannot be literal: for in Re 9:11 it is said, "they had a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit"&#8212;in the Hebrew, Abaddon ("destroyer"), but in the Greek, Apollyon&#8212;and (Re 9:7) "on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men." Compare Joe 2:11, "the day of the Lord &#8230; great and very terrible"; implying their ultimate reference to be connected with Messiah's second coming in judgment. The locust's head is so like that of a horse that the Italians call it cavalette.

Bochart (h) has shown, from various writers, that the head of a locust is in shape like that of a horse; and Theodoret on the text observes, that whoever thoroughly examines the head of a locust will easily perceive that it is very like the head of a horse; see <a href="/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7</a>. The Chaldeans are often represented as strong and mighty, fierce and furious, and riding on horses exceeding swift, <a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <p>and as horsemen, so shall they run; with great agility and swiftness. The particle "as" is observed by some, against those interpreters that apply this wholly to the enemies of the Jews, and not the locusts; and it seems indeed best to favour them; but Theodoret observes, that the "as" here may be taken, not as a note of similitude, but as used for the increase and vehemency of the expression. <p>(h) Hierozoic. par. 2. l. 4. c. 5. p. 474, 475. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">as the appearance of horses</span>, &c.] partly on account of their speed and compact array, but chiefly on account of a resemblance which has been often observed between the head of a locust and the head of a horse (hence the Italian name <span class="ital">cavalletta</span>, and the German name <span class="ital">Heupferd</span>). Theodoret says, “If you observe attentively the head of a locust, you will find it exceedingly like the head of a horse.” And an Arabic poet, quoted by Bochart, <span class="ital">Hieroz</span>. Pt. II., L. iv., c. 4, writes, “They have the thigh of a camel, the legs of an ostrich, the wings of an eagle, the breast of a lion, a tail like a viper’s; and the appearance of a horse adorns them about the head and mouth.” C. Niebuhr heard a similar description in Bagdâd (<span class="ital">Beschreibung von Arabien</span>, 1772, p. 173). “To this day the same metaphor is familiar in every Arab camp” (Tristram, <span class="ital">N.H.B</span>[36] p. 314).

Further description of the march of the locusts. They move on like some mighty host: the noise of their approach is heard from afar; they spread terror before them; their advance is irresistible; the keenest weapons, the strongest walls, are alike powerless to arrest their progress.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - These verses describe the appearance of the locusts and the alarm which their presence causes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses</span>. They arc said to resemble horses in the <span class="accented">shape of the head</span>; hence the Germans call them <span class="accented">Heupferde</span>, or hay-horses, and the Italians <span class="accented">cavalette.</span> This resemblance had been noticed long ago by Theodoret, who says, "If any one should examine accurately the head of the locust, he <span class="cmt_word">will find it exceedingly like that of a horse." And</span> as horsemen, so shall they run. In <span class="accented">rapidity</span> of motion they resembled running horses (<span class="accented">parashim</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap</span>. This is the next circumstance noticed about them, viz. the <span class="accented">noise</span> of their motion. Their motion was peculiar; it was springing or leaping, and, when they sprang or leaped, the noise they made resembled the rattling of a jerky two-wheeled war-chariot over a rough mountain-road. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>No help is to be expected from Assyria, because the Lord will punish His people. <a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>.

"I go, return to my place, till they repent and shall seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me early." For the figure of the lion, which seizes its prey, and tears it in pieces without deliverance, see <a href="/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; denotes the carrying away of booty, as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a>.

The first clause of <a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a> is still to be interpreted from the figure of the lion. As the lion withdraws into its cave, so will the Lord withdraw into His own place, viz., heaven, and deprive the Israelites of His gracious, helpful presence, until they repent, i.e., not only feel themselves guilty, but feel the guilt by bearing the punishment. Suffering punishment awakens the need of mercy, and impels them to seek the face of the Lord. The expression, "in the distress to them," recals &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; &#1500;&#1498; in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>.
