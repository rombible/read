The dumb animals had groaned in distress for food, but now they too have cause to rejoice, and are here called on to do so; and the suitable cause in their case is also specified. It is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">For the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength</span>. He thus specifies the ground of gladness in their case also, pointing to the fresh green of the pastures and the fruit hanging in rich abundance and variety on the trees. The fruits of vines and fig trees are net, it is true, the food of the beasts of the fields; but the revival of vegetation in trees, the higher and larger growths, the chief factor in which is moisture, comprehends the revival of the smaller growths of herbs, grasses, and plants, the proper sustenance of cattle. Kimchi's explanation is that "as the tree bears its fruit in the inhabited part of the world, so in the wilderness the places of pasture grow green." Aben Ezra, who never loses an opportunity of directing attention to contrasts wherever they exist, contrasts "Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field," in this verse with "the beasts of the field cry also unto thee" at the close of the preceding chapter; also "the pastures of the wilderness do spring" with "the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness;" likewise "the tree beareth her fruit" with "all the trees of the field are withered." It has been observed that all plants, even shrubs and trees, spring up at the first as the fresh  young juicy green of plants, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>; then they develop into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, grass: into herb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>; and into tree, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> is not the plural for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, but singular, after the analogy of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (<a href="/psalms/96-12.htm">Psalm 96:12</a>). <span class="accented">Nasaperi</span>, equivalent to "lift up, bear," is more poetical than <span class="accented">asah peri</span>, equivalent to "make fruit;" so in Latin, <span class="accented">surgunt fruges.</span> The expression, "yield their strength," puts the cause for the effect; the strength of the tree produces the fruit and centres in it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Both king and princes are addicted to debauchery (<a href="/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>). "The day of our king" is either the king's birthday, or the day when he ascended the throne, on either of which he probably gave a feast to his nobles. &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is taken most simply as an adverbial accus. loci. On this particular day the princes drink to such an extent, that they become ill with the heat of the wine. &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, generally to make ill, here to make one's self ill. Hitzig follows the ancient versions, in deriving it from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, and taking it as equivalent to &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; ot , "they begin," which gives a very insipid meaning. The difficult expression &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;, "he draws his hand with the scoffers," can hardly be understood in any other way than that suggested by Gesenius (Lex.), "the king goes about with scoffers," i.e., makes himself familiar with them, so that we may compare &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1506;&#1501; (<a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>). The scoffers are drunkards, just as in <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> wine is directly called a scoffer. In <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7-6.htm">Hosea 7:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a>, the thought of the fourth verse is carried out still further. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the explanation and ground of the simile of the furnace; for <a href="/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a> is subordinate to the main thought, and to be taken as a parenthetical remark. The words from &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; to &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1501; ot &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; form one sentence. &#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is construed with &#1489; loci, as in <a href="/judges/19-13.htm">Judges 19:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10</a> : they have brought their heart near, brought them into their craftiness. "Like a furnace" (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) contains an abridged simile. But it is not their heart itself which is here compared to a furnace (their heart  equals  themselves), in the sense of "burning like a flaming furnace with base desires," as Gesenius supposes; for the idea of bringing a furnace into an 'o&#772;rebh would be unsuitable and unintelligible. "The furnace is rather 'orba&#770;m (their ambush), that which they have in common, that which keeps them together; whilst the fuel is libba&#770;m, their own disposition" (Hitzig). Their baker is the machinator doli, who kindles the fire in them, i.e., in actual fact, not some person or other who instigates a conspiracy, but the passion of idolatry. This sleeps through the night, i.e., it only rests till the opportunity and time have arrived for carrying out the evil thoughts of their heart, or until the evil thoughts of the heart have become ripe for execution. This time is described in harmony with the figure, as the morning, in which the furnace burns up into bright flames (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; points to the more remote tannu&#772;r as the subject). In <a href="/hosea/7-7.htm">Hosea 7:7</a> the figure is carried back to the literal fact. With the words, "they are all hot as a furnace," the expression in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7-4.htm">Hosea 7:4</a>, "adulterous like a furnace," is resumed; and now the fruit of this conduct is mentioned, viz., "they devour their judges, cast down their kings." By the judges we are not to understand the sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m of <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>, who are mentioned along with the king as the supreme guardians of the law; but the kings themselves are intended, as the administrators of justice, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>, where sho&#772;phet&#305;&#772;m is also used as synonymous with &#1502;&#1500;&#1498;, and embraces both king and princes. The clause, "all their kings are fallen," adds no new feature to what precedes, and does not affirm that kings have also fallen in addition to or along with the judges; but it sums up what has been stated already, for the purpose of linking on the remark, that no one calls to the Lord concerning the fall of the kings. The suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; does not refer to the fallen kings, but to the nation in its entirety, i.e., to those who have devoured their judges. The thought is this: in the passion with which all are inflamed for idolatry, and with which the princes revel with the kings, they give no such heed to the inevitable consequences of their ungodly conduct, as that any one reflects upon the fall of the kings, or perceives that Israel has forsaken the way which leads to salvation, and is plunging headlong into the abyss of destruction, so as to return to the Lord, who alone can help and save. The prophet has here the times after Jeroboam II in his mind, when Zechariah was overthrown by Shallum, Shallum by Menahem, and Menahem the son of Pekahiah by Pekah, and that in the most rapid succession (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14</a>, <a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>), together with the eleven years' anarchy between Zechariah and Shallum (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8-12</a>). At the same time, the expression, "all their kings have fallen," shows clearly, not only that the words are not to be limited to these events, but embrace all the earlier revolutions, but also and still more clearly, that there is no foundation whatever for the widespread historical interpretation of these verses, as relating to a conspiracy against the then reigning king Zechariah, or Shallum, or Pakahiah, according to which the baker is either Menahem (Hitzig) or Pekah (Schmidt). </body></html>
