Still more was this to be fulfilled to Christians, in whose heart He dwells by love and grace, and of whom He says, "Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there will I be in the midst of them." In the highest sense, "God was in the midst of them," in that  "God the Son, equal to God the Father as touching His Godhead, did, in the truth of human nature, take our flesh. This to see and know, is glory and bliss ineffable. Therefore He repeats, and by repeating, confirms, what he had said, "And My people shall never be ashamed." Yea, glorious, magnified, honored, shall be the people, to whom such a Son was promised, and of whom He was born.

As they go, I spread my net over them; I bring them down like fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, according to the tidings to their assembly." The perfects in <a href="/hosea/7-1.htm">Hosea 7:1</a> describe the conduct of Israel as an accomplished fact, and this is represented by &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; as the necessary consequence of its obstinate impenitence. The point of comparison between Israel and the simple dove, is not that the dove misses its proper dwelling and resting-place, and therefore goes fluttering about (Ewald); nor that, in trying to escape from the hawk, it flies into the net of the bird-catcher (Hitzig); but that when flying about in search of food, it does not observe the net that is spread for it (Rosenmller). &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489; is to be taken as a predicate to Ephraim in spite of the accents, and not to yo&#772;na&#770;h pho&#772;tha&#770;h (a simple dove), since pho&#772;tha&#770;h does not require either strengthening or explaining. Thus does Ephraim seek help from Egypt and Assyria. These words do not refer to the fact that there were two parties in the nation - an Assyrian and an Egyptian. Nor do they mean that the whole nation applied at one time to Egypt to get rid of Asshur, and at another time to Asshur to escape from Egypt. "The situation is rather this: the people being sorely pressed by Asshur, at one time seek help from Egypt against Asshur; whilst at another they try to secure the friendship of the latter" (Hengstenberg, Christology, i. p. 164 transl.). For what threatened Israel was the burden of the "king of princes" (<a href="/hosea/8-10.htm">Hosea 8:10</a>), i.e., the king of Asshur. And this they tried to avert partly by their coquettish arts (<a href="/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a>), and partly by appealing to the help of Egypt; and while doing so, they did not observe that they had fallen into the net of destruction, viz., the power of Assyria. In this net will the Lord entangle them as a punishment. As they go thither, God will spread His net over them like a bird-catcher, and bring them down to the earth like flying birds, i.e., bring them down from the open air, that is to say, from freedom, into the net of captivity, or exile. &#1488;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1501;, a rare hiphil formation with Yod mobile, as in <a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25</a> (see Ewald, 131, c).
