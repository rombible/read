Some translate it “withdraw their ruddiness,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> grow pale; others, “draw into themselves their colour;” others, “contract a livid character.” The alternative rendering in the margin, “pot,” which is that of the LXX., the Vulg., and of Luther’s translation, is obtained from the similarity of the Hebrew words for “ruddiness” and “pot.” The comparison is in this case between the faces growing black under the influence of fear, and of pots under the action of fire. The prophet Nahum uses the same expression (<a href="/joel/2-10.htm" title="The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:">Joel 2:10</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-14 The priests were to alarm the people with the near approach of the Divine judgments. It is the work of ministers to warn of the fatal consequences of sin, and to reveal the wrath from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The striking description which follows, shows what would attend the devastations of locusts, but may also describe the effects from the ravaging of the land by the Chaldeans. If the alarm of temporal judgments is given to offending nations, how much more should sinners be warned to seek deliverance from the wrath to come! Our business therefore on earth must especially be, to secure an interest in our Lord Jesus Christ; and we should seek to be weaned from objects which will soon be torn from all who now make idols of them. There must be outward expressions of sorrow and shame, fasting, weeping, and mourning; tears for trouble must be turned into tears for the sin that caused it. But rending the garments would be vain, except their hearts were rent by abasement and self-abhorrence; by sorrow for their sins, and separation from them. There is no question but that if we truly repent of our sins, God will forgive them; but whether he will remove affliction is not promised, yet the probability of it should encourage us to repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before their face the people shall be much pained - The locust being such a scourge of God, good reason have men to be terrified at their approach; and those are most terrified who have most felt the affliction. In Abyssinia, some province of which was desolated every year, one relates , "When the locusts travel, the people know of it a day before, not because they see them, but they see the sun yellow and the ground yellow, through the shadow which they cast on it (their wings being yellow) and immediately the people become as dead, saying, 'we are lost, for the Ambadas (so they call them) are coming.' I will say what I have seen three times; the first was at Barva. During three years that we were in this land, we often heard them say, 'such a realm, such a land, is destroyed by locusts:' and when it was so, we saw this sign, the sun was yellow, and the shadow on the earth the same, and the whole people became as dead." "The Captain of the place called Coiberia came to me with men, Clerks, and Brothers (Monks) to ask me, for the love God, to help them, that they were all lost through the locusts." : "There were men, women, children, sitting among these locusts, the young brood, as stupefied. I said to them 'why do you stay there, dying? Why do you not kill these animals, and avenge you of the evil which their parents have done you? and at least when dead, they will do you no more evil.' They answered, that they had no courage to resist a plague which God gave them for their sins. We found the roads full of men, women, and children, (some of these on foot, some in arms) their bundles of clothes on their heads, removing to some land where they might find provisions. It was pitiful to see them."<p>Burkhardt relates of South Arabia , "The Bedouins who occupy the peninsula of Sinai are frequently driven to despair by the multitudes of locusts, which constitute a land-plague. They remain there generally for forty or fifty days, and then disappear for the rest of the year." Pliny describes their approach , "they overshadow the sun, the nations looking up with anxiety, lest they should cover their lands. For their strength suffices, and as if it were too little to have passed seas, they traverse immense tracts, and overspread them with a cloud, fatal to the harvest."<p>All faces shall gather blackness - Others, of high-authority, have rendered, shall "withdraw (their) beauty" . But the word signifies to collect together, in order that what is so collected should be present, not absent ; and so is very different from another saying, the stars shall withdraw their shining <a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>. The "their" had also needed to be expressed.) He expresses how the faces contract a livid color from anxiety and fear, as Jeremiah says of the Nazarites, "Their visage is darker than blackness" (<a href="//biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>, see Margin). : "The faces are clothed with lurid hue of coming death; hence they not only grow pale, but are blackened." A slight fear drives the fresh hue from the cheek: the livid hue comes only with the deepest terror. So Isaiah says; "they look amazed one to the other; faces of flame are their faces" <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. much pained&#8212;namely, with terror.

The ‘panic terror’ (Redtenbacher, p. 4) produced by an invasion of locusts on a large scale, can be readily imagined, if we remember not only the immense loss of property, of which they are the cause, but also the terrible destitution, which often follows in their train. In Algiers, after an invasion of locusts in 1866, 200,000 persons are said to have perished from famine. The destruction wrought frequently by the Rocky Mountain locust, over a large area of the United States, is almost incalculable (C. V. Riley, <span class="ital">The Rocky Mountain Locust</span>, chaps. <a href="/joel/2-5.htm" title="Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.">Joel 2:5</a>).

Peoples or nations writhe in pain or tremble at the sight of them, lest they should settle on their fields and gardens, destroying the "golden glories" of the one, and the "leafy honours" of the other.

Thus the Septuagint: "Every face is as the blackness of a pot;" the Syriac also: "Every face shall be black as the blackness of a pot;" in like manner the Chaldee: "All faces are covered with soot, so that they are black as a pot." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> But Aben Ezra connects the word with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, to beautify, glorify, adorn, and translates, "They withdraw (gather to themselves)their redness (ruddiness);" that is, they become pale. The 'Speaker's Commentary ' adopts this view of the expression, and illustrates it by Shakespeare's fancy of the blood being summoned from the face to help the heart in its death-struggle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Being all descended to the labouring heart;<br />Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,<br />Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy:<br />Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth<br />To blush and beautify the cheek again."</span> The parallel usually cited in favour of <span class="accented">asaph</span> being employed in the sense of <span class="accented">withdrawing</span> is, "And the stars shall withdraw their shining" (<a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>). This proceeds  on the supposition that <span class="accented">asaph</span> and <span class="accented">qabhats</span> have the same meaning of "gathering " - gathering up, gathering in, withdrawing. But D. Kimchi quotes his father (Joseph Kimchi) as objecting to this rendering, on the ground of the distinction which he asserts to prevail between them. <span class="accented">Asaph</span>, he says, "is used of gathering together, or in, that which is dispersed, or net present; but <span class="accented">qabhats</span> is not so used." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To this threat the prophet appends in the concluding strophe, both the command to return to the Lord, and the promise that the Lord will raise His smitten nation up again, and quicken them anew with His grace. The separation of these three verses from the preceding one, by the division of the chapters, is at variance with the close connection in the actual contents, which is so perfectly obvious in the allusion made in the words of <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>, "Come, and let us return," to those of <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>, "I will go, and return," and in &#1496;&#1512;&#1507; &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>) to the similar words in <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> and <a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>. <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>. "Come, and let us return to Jehovah: for He has torn in pieces, and will heal us; He has smitten, and will bind us up. <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>. He will quicken us after two days; on the third He will raise us up, that we may live before Him." The majority of commentators, following the example of the Chald. and Septuagint, in which &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, is interpolated before &#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;, have taken the first three verses as an appeal to return to the Lord, addressed by the Israelites in exile to one another. But it would be more simple, and more in harmony with the general style of Hosea, which is characterized by rapid transitions, to take the words as a call addressed by the prophet in the name of the exile. The promise in v. 3 especially is far more suitable to a summons of this kind, than to an appeal addressed by the people to one another. As the endurance of punishment impels to seek the Lord (<a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>), so the motive to return to the Lord is founded upon the knowledge of the fact that the Lord can, and will, heal the wounds which He inflicts. The preterite ta&#770;raph, as compared with the future 'etro&#772;ph in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>, presupposes that the punishment has already begun. The following &#1497;&#1498; is also a preterite with the Vav consec. omitted. The Assyrian cannot heal (<a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>); but the Lord, who manifested Himself as Israel's physician in the time of Moses (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>), and promised His people healing in the future also (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>), surely can. The allusion in the word &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; to this passage of Deuteronomy, is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>. The words, "He revives after two days," etc., are merely a special application of the general declaration, "I kill, and make alive" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>), to the particular case in hand. What the Lord there promises to all His people, He will also fulfil upon the ten tribes of Israel. By the definition "after two days," and "on the third day," the speedy and certain revival of Israel is set before them. Two and three days are very short periods of time; and the linking together of two numbers following one upon the other, expresses the certainty of what is to take place within this space of time, just as in the so-called numerical sayings in <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>; <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-18.htm">Proverbs 30:18</a>, in which the last and greater number expresses the highest or utmost that is generally met with. &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, to raise the dead (<a href="/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a>, <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>). "That we may live before Him:" i.e., under His sheltering protection and grace (cf. <a href="/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18</a>). The earlier Jewish and Christian expositors have taken the numbers, "after two days, and on the third day," chronologically. The Rabbins consequently suppose the prophecy to refer either to the three captivities, the Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Roman, which has not ended yet; or to the three periods of the temple of Solomon, of that of Zerubbabel, and of the one to be erected by the Messiah. Many of the fathers, on the other hand, and many of the early Lutheran commentators, have found in them a prediction of the death of Christ and His resurrection on the third day. Compare, for example, Calovii Bibl. illustr. ad h. l., where this allusion is defended by a long series of undeniably weak arguments, and where a fierce attack is made, not only upon Calvin, who understood these words as "referring to the liberation of Israel from captivity, and the restoration of the church after two days, i.e., in a very short time;" but also upon Grotius, who found, in addition to the immediate historical allusion to the Israelites, whom God would soon liberate from their death-like misery after their conversion, a foretype, in consequence of a special divine indication, of the time "within which Christ would recover His life, and the church its hope." But any direct allusion in the hope here uttered to the death and resurrection of Christ, is proved to be untenable by the simple words and their context. The words primarily hold out nothing more than the quickening of Israel out of its death-like state of rejection from the face of God, and that in a very short period after its conversion to the Lord. This restoration to life cannot indeed be understood as referring to the return of the exiles to their earthly fatherland; or, at all events, it cannot be restricted to this. It does not occur till after the conversion of Israel to the Lord its God, on the ground of faith in the redemption effected through the atoning death of Christ, and His resurrection from the grave; so that the words of the prophet may be applied to this great fact in the history of salvation, but without its being either directly or indirectly predicted. Even the resurrection of the dead is not predicted, but simply the spiritual and moral restoration of Israel to life, which no doubt has for its necessary complement the reawakening of the physically dead. And, in this sense, our passage may be reckoned among the prophetic utterances which contain the germ of the hope of a life after death, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19-21</a>, and in the vision of Ezekiel in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a>.<p>That it did not refer to this in its primary sense, and so far as its historical fulfilment was concerned, is evident from the following verse. <a href="/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. "Let us therefore know, hunt after the knowledge of Jehovah. His rising is fixed like the morning dawn, that He may come to us like the rain, and moisten the earth like the latter rain." &#1493;&#1504;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1504;&#1512; corresponds to &#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; in <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>. The object to &#1504;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; is also &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, and &#1504;&#1491;&#1506;&#1492; is merely strengthened by the addition of &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; &#1500;&#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;. The knowledge of Jehovah, which they would hunt after, i.e., strive zealously to obtain, is a practical knowledge, consisting in the fulfilment of the divine commandments, and in growth in the love of God with all the heart. This knowledge produces fruit. The Lord will rise upon Israel like the morning dawn, and come down upon it like fertilizing rain. &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1493;, His (i.e., Jehovah's) rising, is to be explained from the figure of the dawn (for &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; applied to the rising of the sun, see <a href="/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a> and <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>). The dawn is mentioned instead of the sun, as the herald of the dawning day of salvation (compare <a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>). This salvation which dawns when the Lord appears, is represented in the last clause as a shower of rain that fertilizes the land. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is hardly a kal participle, but rather the imperfect hiphil in the sense of sprinkling. In <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4-5</a>), the rain, or the early and latter rain, is mentioned among the blessings which the Lord will bestow upon His people, when they serve Him with all the heart and soul. This promise the Lord will so fulfil in the case of His newly quickened nation, that He Himself will refresh it like a fertilizing rain. This will take place through the Messiah, as <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a> clearly show. </body></html>
