and the promise implies, that God would perfectly purge away the guilt and defilement of all the sins of his people, by a free pardon and entire sanctification. Calmet, who applies this to the times of the gospel, thus interprets the verse: “Jesus Christ cleanses, by the new law, the blood which remained unclean under the old.

The word signifies only to pronounce innocent, or to free from guilt. Nor is "blood" used of sinfulness generally, but only of the actual guilt of shedding blood. The whole then cannot be an image taken from the cleansing of physical defilement, like the words in the prophet Ezekiel, "then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee" <a href="/ezekiel/16-9.htm">Ezekiel 16:9</a>. Nor again can it mean the forgiveness of sins generally, but only the pronouncing innocent the blood which had been shed. This, the only meaning of the words, fall in with the mention of the "innocent blood," for shedding which, Egypt and Edom had been condemned. The words are the same. There it was said, "because they have shed innocent blood; dam naki;" here, "I will pronounce innocent their blood, nikkethi damam." "How," it is not said. But the sentence on Egypt and Edom explains how God would do it, by punishing those who shed it. For in that He punishes the shedding of it, He declared the "blood" innocent, whose shedding He punished. So in the Revelation it is said, "I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held, and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10-11</a>. : "Then, at the last judgment, when the truth in all things shall be made manifest, He shall "declare the blood" of His people, who clave to Him and His truth, which blood their enemies thought they had shed justly and deservedly as the blood of guilty persons, to have indeed been innocent, by absorbing them from eternal destruction to which He shall then adjudge their enemies for shedding of it."<p>For - (literally and) the Lord dwelleth in Zion He closes with the promise of God's abiding dwelling. He speaks, not simply of a future, but of an ever-abiding present. He who is, the unchangeable God , "the Lord, infinite in power and of eternal Being, who gives necessary being to all His purposes and promises," dwelleth now in "Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem" (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; add <a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>), now by grace and the presence of His Holy Spirit, hereafter in glory. Both of the Church militant on earth and that triumphant in heaven, it is truly to be said, that the Lord dwelleth in them, and that, perpetually. Of the Church on earth will be verified what our Saviour Christ saith, "lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the world" <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>; and of its members Paul saith, that "they" are "of the household of God, an holy temple in the Lord, in whom they are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit" <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21-22</a>. Of the Church triumphant, there is no doubt, that "He" doth and will there dwell, and manifest His glorious presence forever, "in" whose "presence is the fullness of joy, and at His Right Hand" there are "pleasures for evermore" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a> :12. It is an eternal dwelling of the Eternal, varied as to the way and degree of His presence by our condition, now imperfect, there perfected in Him; but He Himself dwelleth on for ever. He, the Unchangeable, dwelleth unchangeably; the Eternal, eternally.<p>: "Glorious things are spoken of thee, thou city of God" <a href="/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a> Jerusalem, our mother, we thy children now groan and weep in this valley of tears, hanging between hope and fear, and, amid toil and conflicts, "lifting up our eyes" to thee and greeting thee from far. Truly "glorious things are spoken of thee." But whatever can be said, since it is said to people and in the words of people, is too little for the "good things" in thee, which "neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man" <a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>. Great to us seem the things which we suffer; but one of thy most illustrious citizens, placed amid those sufferings, who knew something of thee, hesitated not to say, "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>. We will then "rejoice in hope," and "by the waters of Babylon," even while "we sit and weep," we will "remember thee, O Zion. If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget" her cunning.

Which some understand, as the Targum, of the Lord's, inflicting further punishments on the, enemies of his people, for shedding their innocent blood; and that he will not expiate their sins, nor hold them guiltless, or suffer them to go unpunished; but rather this is to be interpreted in a way of grace and mercy, as a benefit bestowed on Judah and Jerusalem, who are the immediate antecedents to the relative here; and in the words a reason is given why they should dwell safely and peaceably for ever, because the Lord will justify them from their sins; forgive their iniquities; cleanse them from all their pollution, signified by blood; of which grace they will have had no application made to them till this time; but now all their guilt and faith will be removed; and particularly God will forgive, and declare to be forgiven their sin of crucifying Christ; whose blood they had imprecated upon themselves and their children, and which has remained on them; but now will be removed, with all the sad effects of it.

So long, namely, as He permitted their blood to remain unavenged, it might be supposed that they had not been slain unjustly: but by the punishment of the murderers (i.e. here, by the desolation of their country) Jehovah declares (implicitly), what He had not declared before, that their blood was innocent (<span class="ital"><a href="/joel/3-19.htm" title="Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.">Joel 3:19</a> b</span>), and had been unjustly shed. <span class="ital">Niḳḳâh</span>, <span class="ital">to hold</span> or <span class="ital">declare innocent</span> (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm" title="You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.">Exodus 20:7</a>; <a href="/job/9-28.htm" title="I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent.">Job 9:28</a> <span class="ital">al.</span>), is chosen on account of <span class="ital">nâḳî’, innocent</span>, in <span class="ital"><a href="/joel/3-19.htm" title="Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.">Joel 3:19</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and Jehovah</span> <span class="ital">dwelleth in Zion</span>] <span class="ital">and</span> is here almost equivalent to <span class="ital">as truly as:</span> in corroboration of the promise made in the preceding clause, the prophet appeals to the indisputable truth that Jehovah’s dwelling-place is in Zion.

They have acted most corruptly, as in the days of Gibeah: He remembers their iniquity, visits their sins." The perfects in <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a> are prophetic. The time of visitation and retribution is approaching. Then will Israel learn that its prophets, who only predicted prosperity and good (<a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>), were infatuated fools. &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; introduces, without k&#305;&#772;, what Israel will experience, as in <a href="/hosea/7-2.htm">Hosea 7:2</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>. It does not follow, from the use of the expression '&#305;&#772;sh ru&#772;a&#774;ch, that the reference is to true prophets. 'Ish ru&#772;a&#774;ch (a man of spirit) is synonymous with the '&#305;&#772;sh ho&#772;le&#772;kh ru&#772;a&#774;ch (a man walking in the spirit) mentioned in <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> as prophesying lies, and may be explained from the fact, that even the false prophets stood under the influence of a superior demoniacal power, and were inspired by a ru&#772;a&#774;ch sheqer ("a lying spirit," <a href="/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>). The words which follow, viz., "a fool is the prophet," etc., which cannot possibly mean, that men have treated, despised, and persecuted the prophets as fools and madmen, are a decisive proof that the expression does not refer to true prophets. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1489; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498; is attached to the principal clauses, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; ... &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. The punishment and retribution occur because of the greatness of the guilt of Israel. In &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; the preposition &#1506;&#1500; continues in force, but as a conjunction: "and because the enmity is great" (cf. Ewald, 351, a). Maste&#772;ma&#770;h, enmity, not merely against their fellow-men generally, but principally against God and His servants the true prophets. This is sustained by facts in <a href="/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a>. The first clause, which is a difficult one and has been interpreted in very different ways, "spying is Ephraim &#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;" (with or by my God), cannot contain the thought that Ephraim, the tribe, is, according to its true vocation, a watchman for the rest of the people, whose duty it is to stand with the Lord upon the watch-tower and warn Israel when the Lord threatens punishment and judgment (Jerome, Schmidt); for the idea of a prophet standing with Jehovah upon a watch-tower is not only quite foreign to the Old Testament, but irreconcilable with the relation in which the prophets stood to Jehovah. The Lord did indeed appoint prophets as watchmen to His people (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>); but He does take His own stand upon the watch-tower with them. Tsa&#770;pha&#770;h in this connection, where prophets are spoken of both before and after, can only denote the eager watching on the part of the prophets for divine revelations, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, and not their looking out for help; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; cannot express their fellowship or agreement with God, if only on account of the suffix "my God," in which Hosea contrasts the true God as His own, with the God of the people. The thought indicated would require &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, a reading which is indeed met with in some codices, but is only a worthless conjecture. &#1506;&#1501; denotes outward fellowship here: "with"  equals  by the side of. Israel looks out for prophecies or divine revelations with the God of the prophet, i.e., at the side of Jehovah; in other words, it does not follow or trust its own prophets, who are not inspired by Jehovah. These are like snares of a bird-catcher in its road, i.e., they cast the people headlong into destruction. &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; stands at the head, both collectively and absolutely. In all its ways there is the trap of the bird-catcher: i.e., all its projects and all that it does will only tend to ensnare the people. Hostility to Jehovah and His servants the true prophets, is in the house of the God of the Israelites, i.e., in the temple erected for the calf-worship; a fact of which Amos (<a href="//biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-17</a>) furnishes a practical example. Israel has thereby fallen as deeply into abomination and sins as in the days of Gibeah, i.e., as at the time when the abominable conduct of the men of Gibeah in connection with the concubine of a Levite took place, as related in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>ff., in consequence of which the tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated. The same depravity on the part of Israel will be equally punished by the Lord now (cf. <a href="/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>). </body></html>
