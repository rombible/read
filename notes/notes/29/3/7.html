The prophet, however, is probably predicting God's dealings with the nations, not with those individuals. The enslaving of these Hebrews in the time of Joram was but one instance out of a whole system of covetous misdeeds.

That is, bring them back to their own land, from their places whither they have been carried captive, and where they have dwelt in obscurity, and as if theft had been buried in graves, but now should be raised up and restored; and this their restoration will be as life from the dead. So the Targum, <p>"behold, I will bring them publicly from the place whither ye have sold them;'' <p>this is to be understood, not of the same persons, but of their posterity, they being the same natural body. Kimchi interprets it of them and their children; them at the resurrection of the dead, their children at the time of salvation. Some think this had its accomplishment in Alexander and his successors, by whom the Jews, who had been detained captives in other countries, were set free; particularly by Demetrius, as Josephus (f) relates: though it may be applied to the future restoration of the Jews, out of all countries, unto their own land; or rather to the gathering together the spiritual Israel, or people of God, who have been persecuted from place to place by their antichristian enemies; <p>and will return your recompence upon your own head; do to them as they have done to others; pay them in their own coin; retaliate the wrongs done to his people; see <a href="/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>. <p>(f) Antiqu. l. 13. c. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Behold, I</span> <span class="bld">am stirring</span> <span class="ital">them</span> <span class="bld">up</span>] i.e. arousing them into activity (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm" title="Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.">Isaiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-9.htm" title="For, see, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.">Jeremiah 50:9</a>, R.V.: <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm" title="Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-25.htm" title="I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call on my name: and he shall come on princes as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.">Isaiah 41:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-13.htm" title="I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 45:13</a>, A.V., R.V. render badly <span class="ital">raise up</span>), and enabling them to leave the land of their servitude.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and will return your</span> <span class="bld">deed</span> <span class="ital">upon your own head</span>] repeated from <span class="ital"><a href="/joel/3-4.htm" title="Yes, and what have you to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will you render me a recompense? and if you recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense on your own head;">Joel 3:4</a> b</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7–8</span>.

Instead of "raise," some prefer "waken," "rouse," or "stir up." The Judaeans would be roused out of the countries into which they had been sold, and restored to their own land, and the measure which had been meted to them meted in turn to their enemies. The deliverance mentioned here may be exemplified, if not realized in part, in the time of Alexander the Great and his successors, when Jewish captives in many lands were set at liberty. Thus Demetrius, in his letter to Jonathan, writes, "I also make free all those Jews who have been made captives and slaves in my kingdom." <span class="cmt_word">And will return your recompense upon your own head</span>; better rendered, <span class="accented">and will turn back your doing upon your head.</span> A righteous retaliation awaited Philistines and Phoenicians. They in turn would fall into the hands of the Judaeans, and be made prisoners of war, and, as they had done, so should it be done to them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This will Israel reap from its ungodly conduct. <a href="/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>. "For they sow wind, and reap tempest: it has no stalks; shoot brings no fruit; and even if it brought it, foreigners would devour it." With this figure, which is so frequently and so variously used (cf. <a href="/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>; <a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>), the threat is accounted for by a general thought taken from life. The harvest answers to the sowing (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). Out of the wind comes tempest. Wind is a figurative representation of human exertions; the tempest, of destruction. Instead of ru&#772;a&#774;ch we have &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (nothingness, weariness, wickedness) in <a href="/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>, and <a href="/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>. In the second hemistich the figure is carried out still further. &#1511;&#1502;&#1492;, "seed standing upon the stalk," is not to it (viz., that which has been sowed). Tsemach brings no qemach, - a play upon the words, answering to our shoot and fruit. Qemach: generally meal, here probably the grain-bearing ear, from which the meal is obtained. But even if the shoot, when grown, should yield some meal, strangers, i.e., foreigners, would consume it. In these words not only are the people threatened with failure of the crop; but the failure and worthlessness of all that they do are here predicted. Not only the corn of Israel, but Israel itself, will be swallowed up. </body></html>
