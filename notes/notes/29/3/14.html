There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophet continues, as in amazement at the great throng assembling upon one another, "multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision," as though, whichever way he looked, there were yet more of these "tumultuous masses," so that there was nothing beside them. It was one living, surging, boiling, sea: throngs upon throngs, mere throngs! . The word rendered "multitudes" suggests, besides, the thought of the hum and din  of these masses thronging onward, blindly, to their own destruction. They all "tumultuously rage together, and imagine a vain thing, against the Lord and against His Christ" <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>; but the place where they are gathered, (although they know it not,) is the "valley of decision," i. e., of "sharp, severe judgment." The valley is the same as that before called "the valley of Jehoshaphat;" but whereas that name only signifies "God judgeth," this further name denotes the strictness of God's judgment. The word signifies "cut," then "decided;" then is used of severe punishment, or destruction decided and decreed , by God.<p>For the Day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision - Their gathering against God shall be a token of His coming to judge them. They come to fulfill their own ends; but His shall be fulfilled on them. They are left to bring about their own doom; and being abandoned by Him, rush on the more blindly because it is at hand. When their last sin is committed, their last defiance of God spoken or acted against Him, it is come. At all times, indeed, "the Lord is at hand" <a href="/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>. It may be, that we are told, that the whole future revealed to us "must shortly come to pass" <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>, in order to show that all time is a mere nothing, a moment, a dream, when it is gone. Yet here it is said, relatively, not to us, but to the things foretold, that it "is near" to come. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. The prophet in vision seeing the immense array of nations congregating, exclaims, "Multitudes, multitudes!" a Hebraism for immense multitudes.<p>valley of decision&#8212;that is, the valley in which they are to meet their "determined doom." The same as "the valley of Jehoshaphat," that is, "the valley of judgment" (see on [1135]Joe 3:2). Compare Joe 3:12, "there will I sit to judge," which confirms English Version rather than Margin, "threshing." The repetition of "valley of decision" heightens the effect and pronounces the awful certainty of their doom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/joel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Multitudes, multitudes; </span> whether prediction or exclamation with wonder, it is doubled to intimate the mighty, numerous armies contending one against another, and thrashing each other, overthrowing numberless men between the conquered and conqueror.

After this we meet Sennacherib’s mighty hosts against Egypt and the Philistines, to neither of which could he march but either through part of Judea or very near to it, and after this he hath one hundred and eighty-five thousand slain in one night before Jerusalem; beside Necho’s army marching toward Carchemish, and Nebuchadnezzar’s army in pursuit of the routed Egyptian, and the armies of Alexander the Great, and after these the armies of the Seleucid and the Lagidee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the valley of decision; </span> where God, having by wise providence gathered them, did by just determination of the victory decide their quarrels, and by the conqueror punished the conquered for their sins against God and his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The day of the Lord; </span> the day of vengeance and righteous recompences upon enemies, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">is near:</span> if it begin in the punishment of Nineveh and the Assyrian kingdom, by the cutting off Sennacherib’s army, it was in Joel’s time, not above sixty-four years, supposing Joel prophesied in Jeroboam the Second’s time; and probably not quite twenty years to this day of the Lord if Joel prophesied this in Hezekiah’s time, or after the captivating of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser, which was A.M. 3283, and Sennacherib’s overthrow was 3294, eleven years after the deportation, as Archbishop Usher in his Annals. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/joel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision,.... The same with the valley of Jehoshaphat before mentioned; which shows that not any valley of that name is intended, but a certain place so called from the judgments of God in it; and here named "the valley of decision", because here their judgment will be determined, as Kimchi and Jarchi; and at this time the controversy between God, and his people's enemies, will be decided, and at an end: or "the valley of concision", as the Vulgate Latin version; because in this place, and at this time, the nations gathered together in it will be cut to pieces: or, as others, "the valley of threshing" (p); because, as, in Jehoshaphat's time, the Moabites and Ammonites were threshed by the Jews in the valley of Berachah, to which the allusion is; so at this time the antichristian kings and their armies will be threshed and beaten, and destroyed by the men of Judah, God's professing people; see <a href="/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>; these seem to be the words of the prophet, breaking out into this pathetic exclamation, upon a sight of the vast multitudes gathered together in this valley, and slain in it; and the doubling of the word serves to express the prodigious number of them: and this shows that this prophecy refers either to the vast army of the Turks, under the name of Gog, and the great slaughter that will be made of them; and that this valley may be the same with the valley of Hamongog, that is, the valley of the multitude of Gog, where their multitude of slain shall be buried, <a href="/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>; or to that vast carnage of the antichristian kings and their armies at Armageddon, <a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; the Targum is, <p>"armies, armies, in the valley of the division of judgment:'' <p>for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision; that is, the great and terrible day of the Lord, to take vengeance on all the antichristian powers, both eastern and western, is nigh at hand, which will be done in this valley. <p>(p)  "in valle triturationis", Piscatsr. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

In one part the prophet sees in vision and shows us pictorially the multitudes of the nations pouring on in one continuous stream into the fatal valley.

The slain-offerings of my sacrificial gifts, equivalent to the gifts of slain-offerings presented to me continually, they sacrifice as flesh, and eat it; that is to say, they are nothing more than flesh, which they slay and eat, and not sacrifices in which Jehovah takes delight, or which could expiate their sins. Therefore the Lord will punish their sins; they will return to Egypt, i.e., be driven away into the land of bondage, out of which God once redeemed His people. These words are simply a special application of the threat, held out by Moses in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>, to the degenerate ten tribes. Egypt is merely a type of the land of bondage, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, <a href="/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>. In <a href="/hosea/8-14.htm">Hosea 8:14</a> the sin of Israel is traced back to its root. This is forgetfulness of God, and deification of their own power, and manifests itself in the erection of &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, palaces, not idolatrous temples. Judah also makes itself partaker of this sin, by multiplying the fortified cities, and placing its confidence in fortifications. These castles of false security the Lord will destroy.
