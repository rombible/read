Not only parted their land, but cast lots for their persons, Or played at dice for them, how many captives each soldier should have, and which should be their share and property: ninety seven thousand Jews, Josephus (d) says, were carried captive by the Romans, who, very probably, cast lots for them, as was usual in such cases; see <a href="/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>; <p>and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink; either they gave a boy to be prostituted to natural lusts, in lieu of a whore; and a girl to be debauched for a bottle of wine: or they gave a boy for the price of a whore, as the Targum and Kimchi interpret it; that is, they gave a boy, instead of money, to a whore, to lie with her, as the eunuch was given to Thais; and they gave a girl to the wine merchant for as much wine as they could drink at one sitting. These phrases both express their uncleanness and intemperance, and also the low price and value they set upon their captives; and is applicable enough to the Papists, notorious for the same abominable lusts. <p>(d) De Bello Jud. l. 6. c. 9. sect. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/joel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they have cast lots for my people; and have <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</span><p>(c) That which the enemy received for the sale of my people, they bestowed upon harlots and drink.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. The reference is to the custom, common in ancient warfare, by which the conquerors divided amongst themselves the captives by lot, to deal with them afterwards as they pleased: and the Jewish prisoners were held by their captors so cheap that one who had received a boy as his lot sold him to a slave-dealer in exchange for a harlot,—or perhaps (Targ. Pesh.) gave him for the hire of a harlot,—and one who had received a girl parted with her for the sake of a carouse of wine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cast lots</span>] <a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm" title="In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.">Obadiah 1:11</a> (of Jerusalem at the time of its capture by the Chaldaeans), <a href="/nahum/3-10.htm" title="Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.">Nahum 3:10</a> (where it is said, as a special indignity, that lots were cast on the “honourable men” of No-amon);—each time the same phrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that they might drink</span>] <span class="bld">and have drunk.</span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink</span>. Such was the contumely with which they were treated at the time of the great catastrophe referred to. The captives were distributed by lot among the conquerors; these in turn sold them to the slave-dealers for the merest trifle - a slave-boy for the hire of a harlot, or a slave-girl for a glass or draught of wine. Such treatment had been predicted ages before, and was verified by contemporaneous history (comp. <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a> for the prediction; and Josephus, . De Bell. Jud., 6.9.2,3, for the fulfilment). Ninety-seven thousand prisoners were disposed of as follows: those under seventeen years of age were publicly sold; some exiled to work in Egyptian mines; others reserved to fight with wild beasts in the amphi-theatre. Also in the time of Hadrian four Jewish captives were sold for a measure of barley. Nay, more, the Syrian commander, Nicanor, bargained by anticipation for the sale of such Jews as should be taken cap-tire in the Maccabean war. The prophet, moreover, looks forward in prophetic vision to the day of final judgment, when God will, in just retribution, pour out the vials of his wrath on all the oppressors of his Church and people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But this knowledge of God, regarded simply as a historical acquaintance with Him, cannot possibly bring salvation. <a href="/hosea/8-3.htm">Hosea 8:3</a>.

Because Israel has despised this good, let the enemy pursue it. </body></html>
