The words, "And also," show that this is something additional to the deeds of those before spoken of. Those, instanced before, were great oppressors, such as dispersed the former people of God and "divided their land." In addition to these, God condemns here another class, those who, without having power to destroy, harass and vex His heritage. The words, "what are ye to Me?" are like that other phrase, "what is there to thee and me?" (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/22-24.htm">Joshua 22:24</a>, etc; <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>, ...), i. e., what have we in common? These words, "what are ye to Me?" also declare, that those nations had no part in God. God accounts them as aliens, "what are ye to Me?" Nothing. But the words convey, besides, that they would, unprovoked, have to do with God, harassing His people without cause. They obtruded themselves, as it were, upon God and His judgments; they challenged God; they thrust themselves in, to their destruction, where they had no great temptation to meddle, noticing, but inbred malice, to impel them.<p>This was, especially, the character of the relations of Tyre and Zidon and Philistia with Israel. They were allotted to Israel by Joshua, but were not assailed . On the contrary, "the Zidonians" are counted among those who "oppressed" Israel, and "out of" whose "hand" God "delivered" him, when he "cried" to God <a href="/judges/10-12.htm">Judges 10:12</a>.

This is the last event before the time of Joel. They stand among the most inveterate and unprovoked enemies of God's people, and probably as enemies of God also hating the claim of Judah that their God was the One God.<p>Will ye render Me a recompense? - People never want pleas for themselves. The Philistines, although the aggressors, had been signally defeated by David. People forget their own wrong-doings and remember their sufferings. It may be then, that the Philistines thought that they had been aggrieved when their assaults were defeated, and looked upon their own fresh aggressions as a requital. If moreover, as is probable, they heard that the signal victories won over them were ascribed by Israel to God, and themselves also suspected, that these "mighty Gods" <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-7.htm">1 Samuel 4:7-8</a> were the cause of their defeat, they doubtless turned their hatred against God. People, when they submit not to God chastening them, hate Him. This belief that they were retaliating against God, (not, of course, knowing Him as God,) fully corresponds with the strong words, "will ye render Me "a recompense?" Julian's dying blasphemy, "Galilean, thou hast conquered," corresponds with the efforts of his life against the gospel, and implies a secret consciousness that He whose religion he was straining to overthrow "might" be, What he denied Him to be, God. The phrase  "swiftly," literally "lightly, and speedily, denotes" the union of easiness with speed. The recompense is returned "upon" their head, coming down upon them from God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. what have ye to do with me&#8212;Ye have no connection with Me (that is, with My people: God identifying Himself with Israel); I (that is, My people) have given you no cause of quarrel, why then do ye trouble Me (that is, My people)?

The Phoenicians and Philistines are here singled out as the nations which have sinned especially against Israel: they have not only enriched their own palaces with the plunder of Judah, but have also sold Judahite captives into slavery to the Greeks; a swift and just retribution is accordingly pronounced against them.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-8.</span> - In these verses the prophet pauses before proceeding to describe the final judgment of the world-powers for their hostility to and oppression of his Church, and points out the bitter enmity of neigh-bouring nations to the covenant people in the prophet's own day, with a prediction of the righteous retribution that awaited them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The northern sea-board of the Phoenicians, including the famous cities of Tyre and Sidon, also the southern sea-coast and plain of the Philistines, with their five principalities, are joined by <span class="accented">vegam</span> with the nations notorious for injuring and oppressing the people of God. The words rendered in the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">What have ye to do with me?</span> rather mean, <span class="accented">What would ye with</span> me? or still better, <span class="accented">What are ye to me</span>? that is. how worthless and despicable in my sight! The disjunctive question which follows becomes clearer by adopting the rendering of Keil and Wunsche, <span class="cmt_word">Will ye repay me a deed, or do anything against me?</span> that is, will ye repay me some wrong-doing which ye fancy I have inflicted on you? or will ye, without such supposed provocation, and of your own free will, do or attempt to do anything against me? The double question with <span class="accented">veim</span> instead of <span class="accented">im</span> repeats, in other words or in a modified form, the preceding question; while the question itself, as often, implies a negative sense to the effect that they had neither right nor reason for averting themselves on the people of God - for God here identifies himself with his people - nor for attempting wantonly and gratuitously to harm them. The consequence would only be a swift and speedy return of the mischief on their own head, so that, as is usual with the wicked, they fall themselves into the pit which they dig for others. The idea of revenge rather than of punishment gets too great prominence in the old versions and commentators. The comment of Kimchi is instructive, though more in harmony with the rendering of the Authorized Version than with that which we prefer; it is as follows: "What have I to do with you, that ye enter my land while ye are neighbours? and it behoved you to do good to my people, but ye have not done so; but when ye saw that the kings of the nations (Gentiles)came upon them, ye allied yourselves with them to plunder and spoil....  Why is it, then, that ye are doing evil to me, if ye think to avenge yourselves of me because I have done you evil? When did I do you evil? Or if you will say that of yourselves ye are doing evil to me now, for he that does evil to Israel from his thought of doing evil to me, they are my children...  swiftly and suddenly will I return your doing on your own head." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The proof of Israel's renunciation of its God is to be found in the facts mentioned in <a href="/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>. "They have set up kings, but not from me, have set up princes, and I know it not: their silver and their gold they have made into idols, that it may be cut off." The setting up of kings and princes, not from Jehovah, and without His knowledge, i.e., without His having been asked, refers chiefly to the founding of the kingdom by Jeroboam I. It is not to be restricted to this, however, but includes at the same time the obstinate persistence of Israel in this ungodly attitude on all future occasions, when there was either a change or usurpation of the government. And the fact that not only did the prophet Ahijah foretel to Jeroboam I that he would rule over the ten tribes (<a href="/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>.), but Jehu was anointed king over Israel by Elisha's command (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9</a>), and therefore both of them received the kingdom by the express will of Jehovah, is not at variance with this, so as to require the solution that we have a different view here from that which prevails in the books of Kings, - namely, one which sprang out of the repeated changes of government and anarchies in this kingdom (Simson). For neither the divine promise of the throne, nor the anointing performed by the command of God, warranted their forcibly seizing upon the government, - a crime of which both Jeroboam and Jehu rendered themselves guilty. The way in which both of them paved the way to the throne was not in accordance with the will of God, but was most ungodly (see at <a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). Jeroboam was already planning a revolt against Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>), and led the gathering of the ten tribes when they fell away from the house of David 91 Kings <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>.). Of Jehu, again, it is expressly stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14</a>, that he conspired against Joram. And the other usurpers, just like the two already named, opened the way to the throne by means of conspiracies, whilst the people not only rebelled against the rightful heir to the throne at Solomon's death, from pure dislike to the royal house of David, which had been appointed by God, and made Jeroboam king, but expressed their approval of all subsequent conspiracies as soon as they have been successful. This did not come from Jehovah, but was a rebellion against Him - a transgression of His covenant. To this must be added the further sin, viz., the setting up of the idolatrous calf-worship on the part of Jeroboam, to which all the kings of Israel adhered. It was in connection with this, that the application of the silver and gold to idols, by which Israel completely renounced the law of Jehovah, had taken place. It is true that silver was not used in the construction of the golden calves; but it was employed in the maintenance of their worship. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;: that it (the gold and silver) may be destroyed, as more fully stated in <a href="/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a>. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; describes the consequence of this conduct, which, though not designed, was nevertheless inevitable, as if it had been distinctly intended. </body></html>
