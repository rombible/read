The profanation of God’s temple, and the sacrilegious robbing it of its vessels and ornaments, were crimes remarkably punished by God in heathen and infidels: see <a href="/jeremiah/50-28.htm" title="The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.">Jeremiah 50:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm" title="Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.">Jeremiah 51:11</a>.

At least, up to the prophet's time, they had not done this. For the inroad of the Philistines in the reign of Jehoram was, apparently, a mere marauding expedition, in which they killed and plundered, but are not said to have besieged or taken any city, much less Jerusalem. God calls "the silver and gold" which He, through His Providence, had bestowed on Judah, "My" gold and silver; as He said by Hosea Hos 2:8.<p>"She knew not that I multiplied her silver and gold, whereof she made Baal;" and by Haggai, "The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of Hosts" <a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a>. For they were His people, and what they had, they held of Him; and the Philistines too so accounted it, and dedicated a part of it to their idols, as they had the ark formerly, accounting the victory over God's people to be the triumph of their idols over God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. my silver &#8230; my gold&#8212;that is, the gold and silver of My people.

Compare also 1Ki 15:18; 2Ki 12:18; 14:14, for the spoiling of the treasures of the temple and the king's palace in Judah by Syria.

For this also is from Israel: a workman made it, and it is not God; but the calf of Samaria will become splinters." Za&#770;nach (disgusts) points back to <a href="/hosea/8-3.htm">Hosea 8:3</a>. As Israel felt disgust at what was good, so did Jehovah at the golden calf of Samaria. It is true that za&#770;nach is used here intransitively in the sense of smelling badly, or being loathsome; but this does not alter the meaning, which is obvious enough from the context, namely, that it is Jehovah whom the calf disgusts. The calf of Samaria is not a golden calf set up in the city of Samaria; as there is no allusion in history to any such calf as this. Samaria is simply mentioned in the place of the kingdom, and the calf is the one that was set up at Bethel, the most celebrated place of worship in the kingdom, which is also the only one mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>, <a href="/hosea/10-15.htm">Hosea 10:15</a>. On account of this calf the wrath of Jehovah is kindled against the Israelites, who worship this calf, and cannot desist. This is the thought of the question expressing disgust at these abominations. How long are they incapable of &#1504;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, i.e., purity of walk before the Lord, instead of the abominations of idolatry (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4</a>); not "freedom from punishment," as Hitzig supposes. To &#1500;&#1506; &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, "they are unable," we may easily supply "to bear," as in <a href="/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a> and <a href="/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>. "For" (k&#305;&#772;, <a href="/hosea/8-6.htm">Hosea 8:6</a>) follows as an explanation of the main clause in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5</a>, "Thy calf disgusts."
