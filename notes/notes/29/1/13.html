See what perishing, uncertain things our creature-comforts are. See how we need to live in continual dependence upon God and his providence. See what ruinous work sin makes. As far as poverty occasions the decay of piety, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is a very sore judgment.

The outward affliction is an expression of the inward grief, and itself excites to further grief. This their garment of affliction and penitence, they were not to put off day and night. Their wonted duty was to "offer up sacrifice for their own sins and the sins of the people" <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, and to entreat God for them. This their office the prophet calls them to discharge day and night; to "come" into the court of the temple, and there, where God showed Himself in majesty and mercy, "lie all night" prostrate before God, not at ease, but in sackcloth. He calls to them in the Name of his God, "Ye ministers of my God;" of Him, to whom, whosoever forsook Him, he himself was faithful. : "The prophets called the God of all, their own God, being united to Him by singular love and reverential obedience, so that they could say, "God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever" <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>.

The cessation of the daily sacrifices again occupies the prophet’s thought; and he turns to the priests, bidding them not mourn only (<span class="ital"><a href="/joel/1-9.htm" title="The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.">Joel 1:9</a></span>), but clothe themselves in sackcloth, and proclaim a day of public fast and humiliation. The occasion, namely, is not one for grief only: it is one which calls also for penitence and prayer; such a calamity is a judgement, not merely betokening God’s present anger with His people, but awakening the apprehension of sorer judgements in the future, which it behoves the nation, by timely penitence, if possible to avert.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Gird yourselves</span>] viz. with sackcloth (<span class="ital"><a href="/joel/1-8.htm" title="Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.">Joel 1:8</a></span>), as the R.V. supplies.

The invitation, or rather exhortation, here is to something more than lamentation and mourning; for, however natural in the circumstances, affliction itself could not avert or remove the calamity. They are urged, therefore, to repentance as well as lamentation. They were to assume the outward signs of the inward grace: they were to gird themselves with sackcloth, the outward symbol of their inward sorrow; next they were to enter the temple or house of God; they were to spend the night there in the attitude and garb of mourners; night and day they were to bewail their sins with humble, penitent, and contrite hearts. The priests are the persons first addressed, and that not only because, in discharge of their priestly functions as ministers of Jehovah and ministering at the altar, they had been specially touched by the present distress; but also because of their official position they were to present an example to the people whose leaders they were and on whose behalf they ministered (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>, "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"). Kimchi gives a correct exposition of this verse: "<span class="accented">Gird</span>, that is to say, gird on sackcloth, and he explains afterwards, pass the night in sackcloth, because even by night ye shall not remove the sackcloth from off you; perhaps Jehovah will have mercy upon you. And he says, 'ministers of the altar,' and adds, 'ministers of my God,' because the ministry was as the altar to God; and he connects the ministry to God - to the altar, as wherein they minister to Jehovah." <span class="cmt_word">For the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God</span>. This is the reason assigned for the urgent call to repentance; and it is much the same with that in the beginning of the ninth verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom; Israel has defiled itself. <a href="/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>. Their works do not allow to return to their God, for the spirit of whoredom is in them, and they know not Jehovah." By &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, the whoredom of Ephraim is designated as in fact lying before them, and therefore undeniable; but not, as Hitzig supposes, an act which has taken place once for all, viz., the choice of a king, by which the severance of the kingdoms and the previous idolatry had been sanctioned afresh. &#1504;&#1496;&#1502;&#1488;, defiled by whoredom, i.e., idolatry. Their works do not allow them to return to their God, because the works are merely an emanation of the character and state of the heart, and in their hearts the demon of whoredom has its seat (cf. <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>), and the knowledge of the Lord is wanting; that is to say, the demoniacal power of idolatry has taken complete possession of the heart, and stifled the knowledge of the true God. The rendering, "they do not direct their actions to this," is incorrect, and cannot be sustained by an appeal to the use of &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489; in <a href="/judges/15-1.htm">Judges 15:1</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8</a>., or to <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>. </body></html>
