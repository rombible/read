If the materials for these, the grain and wine, ceased, through locusts or drought or the wastings of war, the sacrifice must become mangled and imperfect. The priests were to mourn for the defects of the sacrifice; they lost also their own subsistence, since the altar was, to them, in place of all other inheritance. The meat and drink offerings were emblems of the materials of the holy eucharist, by which Malachi foretold that, when God had rejected the offering of the Jews, there should be a "pure offering" among the pagan <a href="/joel/1-11.htm">Joel 1:11</a>. When then holy communions become rare, the meat and drink offering are literally cut off from the house of the Lord, and those who are indeed priests, the ministers of the Lord, should mourn. Joel foretells that, however love should wax cold, there should ever be such. He forsees and foretells at once, the failure, and the grief of the priests. Nor is it an idle regret which he foretells, but a mourning unto their God. : "Both meat offering and drink offering hath perished from the house of God, not in actual substance but as to reverence, because, amid the prevailing iniquity there is scarcely found in the Church, who should duly celebrate, or receive the sacraments." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The cessation of the daily sacrifices would be regarded as a national misfortune: even during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans, they were maintained as long as possible, and when ultimately they had to be suspended, the people, we are told, “were terribly despondent” (Jos. <span class="ital">B.

The drink-offering was a libation of wine, which usually accompanied a burnt-offering. Here the reference is, no doubt, to the meal- and drink-offering, which, according to the Priestly Code (<a href="/context/exodus/29-38.htm" title="Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually....">Exodus 29:38-42</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/28-3.htm" title="And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering....">Numbers 28:3-8</a>), were to accompany the daily morning and evening burnt-offering.

The wind has wrapt it up in its wings, so that they are put to shame because of their sacrifices." &#1505;&#1512; from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to fall off, degenerate, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>. &#1505;&#1489;&#1488; is probably strong, intoxicating wine (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>); here it signifies the effect of this wine, viz., intoxication. Others take sa&#770;r in the usual sense of departing, after <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-14.htm">1 Samuel 1:14</a>, and understand the sentence conditionally: "when their intoxication is gone, they commit whoredom." But Hitzig has very properly object to this, that it is intoxication which leads to licentiousness, and not temperance. Moreover, the strengthening of hisnu&#772; by the inf. abs. is not in harmony with this explanation. The hiphil hizna&#770;h is used in an emphatic sense, as in <a href="/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>. The meaning of the last half of the verse is also a disputed point, more especially on account of the word &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, which only occurs here, and which can only be the imperative of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;), or a contraction of &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;. All other explanations are arbitrary. But we are precluded from taking the word as an imperative by &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, which altogether confuses the sense, if we adopt the rendering "their shields love 'Give ye' - shame." We therefore prefer taking &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; as a contraction of &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, and &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; as a construction resembling the pealal form, in which the latter part of the fully formed verb is repeated, with the verbal person as an independent form (Ewald, 120), viz., "their shields loved, loved shame," which yields a perfectly suitable thought. The princes are figuratively represented as shields, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/47-10.htm">Psalm 47:10</a>, as the supporters and protectors of the state. They love shame, inasmuch as they love the sin which brings shame. This shame will inevitably burst upon the kingdom. The tempest has already seized upon the people, or wrapt them up with its wings (cf. <a href="/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>), and will carry them away (<a href="/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>). &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, literally to bind together, hence to lay hold of, wrap up. Ru&#772;a&#774;ch, the wind, or tempest, is a figurative term denoting destruction, like &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-3.htm">Ezekiel 5:3-4</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; refers to Ephraim represented as a woman, like the suffix attached to &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>. &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, to be put to shame on account of their sacrifices, i.e., to be deceived in their confidence in their idols (bo&#772;sh with min as in <a href="/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>, etc.), or to discover that the sacrifices which they offered to Jehovah, whilst their heart was attached to the idols, did not save from ruin. The plural formation &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; only occurs here, but it has many analogies in its favour, and does not warrant our altering the reading into &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, after the Sept. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, as Hitzig proposes; whilst the inadmissibility of this proposal is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that there is nothing to justify the omission of the indispensable &#1502;&#1503;, and the cases which Hitzig cites as instances in which min is omitted (viz., <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a>) are based upon a false interpretation. </body></html>
