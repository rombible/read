With all the marks of sorrow and shame, sin must be confessed and bewailed. A day is to be appointed for this purpose; a day in which people must be kept from their common employments, that they may more closely attend God's services; and there is to be abstaining from meat and drink. Every one had added to the national guilt, all shared in the national calamity, therefore every one must join in repentance. When joy and gladness are cut off from God's house, when serious godliness decays, and love waxes cold, then it is time to cry unto the Lord. The prophet describes how grievous the calamity. See even the inferior creatures suffering for our transgression. And what better are they than beasts, who never cry to God but for corn and wine, and complain of the want of the delights of sense? Yet their crying to God in those cases, shames the stupidity of those who cry not to God in any case. Whatever may become of the nations and churches that persist in ungodliness, believers will find the comfort of acceptance with God, when the wicked shall be burned up with his indignation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How do the beasts groan! - There is something very pitiable in the cry of the brute creation, even because they are innocent, yet bear man's guilt. Their groaning seems to the prophet to be beyond expression. How vehemently do they "groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed," as though, like man, they were endued with reason, to debate where to find their food. Yea, not these only, but the flocks of sheep, which might find pasture where the herds could not, these too shall bear the punishment of guilt. They suffered by the guilt of man; and yet so stupid was man, that he was not so sensible of his own win for which they suffered, as they of its effect. The beasts cried to God, but even their cries did not awaken His own people.

"Blow ye the horn at Gibeah, the trumpet at Ramah! Raise the cry at Bethaven, Behind thee, Benjamin!" The blowing of the sho&#772;pha&#770;r, a far-sounding horn, or of the trumpet<p>(Note: "The sophar was a shepherd's horn, and was made of a carved horn; the tuba (cha&#774;tso&#772;tsera&#770;h) was made of brass or silver, and sounded either in the time of war or at festivals." - Jerome.)<p>(cha&#774;tso&#772;tsera&#770;h), was a signal by which the invasion of foes (<a href="/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>) and other calamities (<a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, cf. <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>) were announced, to give the inhabitants warning of the danger that threatened them. The words therefore imply that foes had invaded the land. Gibeah (of Saul; see at <a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>) and Ramah (of Samuel; see at <a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>) were two elevated places on the northern boundary of the tribe of Benjamin, which were well adapted for signals, on account of their lofty situation. The introduction of these particular towns, which did not belong to the tribe of Israel, but to that of Judah, is intended to intimate that the enemy has already conquered the kingdom of the ten tribes, and has advanced to the border of that of Judah. &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, to make a noise, is to be understood here as relating to the alarm given by the war-signals already mentioned, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, cf. <a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>. Bethaven is Bethel (Beitin), as in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>, the seat of the idolatrous worship of the calves; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is to be taken in the sense of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; (according to Ges. 118, 1). The difficult words, "behind thee, Benjamin," cannot indicate the situation or attitude of Benjamin, in relation to Bethel or the kingdom of Israel, or show that "the invasion is to be expected to start from Benjamin," as Simson supposes. For the latter is no more appropriate in this train of thought than a merely geographical or historical notice. The words are taken from the ancient war-song of Deborah (<a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>), but in a different sense from that in which they are used there. There they mean that Benjamin marched behind Ephraim, or joined it in attacking the foe; here, on the contrary, they mean that the foe is coming behind Benjamin - that the judgment announced has already broken out in the rear of Benjamin. There is no necessity to supply "the enemy rises" behind thee, O Benjamin, as Jerome proposes, or "the sword rages," as Hitzig suggests; but what comes behind Benjamin is implied in the words, "Blow ye the horn," etc. What these signals announce is coming after Benjamin; there is no necessity, therefore, to supply anything more than "it is," or "it comes." The prophet, for example, not only announces in <a href="/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a> that enemies will invade Israel, but that the hosts by which God will punish His rebellious people have already overflowed the kingdom of Israel, and are now standing upon the border of Judah, to punish this kingdom also for its sins. This is evident from <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-9.htm">Hosea 5:9</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>, which contain the practical explanation of <a href="/hosea/5-8.htm">Hosea 5:8</a>. </body></html>
