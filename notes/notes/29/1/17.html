With all the marks of sorrow and shame, sin must be confessed and bewailed. A day is to be appointed for this purpose; a day in which people must be kept from their common employments, that they may more closely attend God's services; and there is to be abstaining from meat and drink. Every one had added to the national guilt, all shared in the national calamity, therefore every one must join in repentance. When joy and gladness are cut off from God's house, when serious godliness decays, and love waxes cold, then it is time to cry unto the Lord. The prophet describes how grievous the calamity. See even the inferior creatures suffering for our transgression. And what better are they than beasts, who never cry to God but for corn and wine, and complain of the want of the delights of sense? Yet their crying to God in those cases, shames the stupidity of those who cry not to God in any case. Whatever may become of the nations and churches that persist in ungodliness, believers will find the comfort of acceptance with God, when the wicked shall be burned up with his indignation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The seed is rotten under the clods - Not only was all to be cut off for the present, but, with it, all hope for the future.

Jehovah will withdraw from the faithless generation, and visit it with His judgments. This is the train of thought in the next strophe (<a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6-10</a>). <a href="/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>. "They will go with their sheep and their oxen to seek Jehovah, and will not find Him: He has withdrawn Himself from them. <a href="/hosea/5-7.htm">Hosea 5:7</a>. They acted treacherously against Jehovah, for they have born strange children: now will the new moon devour them with their fields." The offering of sacrifices will be no help to them, because God has withdrawn Himself from them, and does not hear their prayers; for God has no pleasure in sacrifices which are offered in an impenitent state of mind (cf. <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>.; <a href="/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21</a>.; <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8</a>.). The reason for this is given in <a href="/hosea/5-7.htm">Hosea 5:7</a>. Ba&#770;gad, to act faithlessly, which is frequently applied to the infidelity of a wife towards her husband (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>; cf. <a href="/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>), points to the conjugal relation in which Israel stood to Jehovah. Hence the figure which follows. "Strange children" are such as do not belong to the home (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>), i.e., such as have not sprung from the conjugal union. In actual fact, the expression is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1494;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4</a>, though za&#770;r does not expressly mean "adulterous." Israel ought to have begotten children of God in the maintenance of the covenant with the Lord; but in its apostasy from God it had begotten an adulterous generation, children whom the Lord could not acknowledge as His own. "The new moon will devour them," viz., those who act so faithlessly. the meaning is not, "they will be destroyed on the next new moon;" but the new moon, as the festal season, on which sacrifices were offered (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-6.htm">1 Samuel 20:6</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13-14</a>), stands here for the sacrifices themselves that were offered upon it. The meaning is this: your sacrificial feast, your hypocritical worship, so far from bringing you salvation, will rather prove your sin. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; are not sacrificial portions, but the hereditary portions of Israel, the portions of land that fell to the different families and households, and from the produce of which they offered sacrifices to the Lord.<p>(Note: It is very evident from this verse, that the feasts and the worship prescribed in the Mosaic law were observed in the kingdom of the ten tribes, at the places of worship in Bethel and Dan.) </body></html>
