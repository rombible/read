Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word of the Lord that came to Joel - Joel, like Hosea, mentions the name of his father only, and then is silent about his extraction, his tribe, his family. He leaves even the time when he lived, to be guessed at. He would be known only, as the instrument of God. "The word of the Lord came to" him (see the note at <a href="/hosea/1-1.htm">Hosea 1:1</a>), and he willed simply to be the voice which uttered it. He was "content to live under the eyes of God, and, as to people, to be known only in what concerned their salvation." But this he declares absolutely, that the Word of God came to him; in order that we may give faith to his prophecy, being well assured that what he predicted, would come to pass. So the Saviour Himself says, ""My words shall not pass away" <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>. For truth admits of nothing false, and what God saith, will certainly be. For "He confirmeth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers" <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>. The prophet claimeth belief then, as speaking not out of his own heart, but out of the mouth of the Lord speaking in the Spirit." Joel signifies, "The Lord is God." It owns that God who had revealed Himself, is alone the God. The prophet's name itself, embodied the truth, which, after the miraculous answer to Elijah's prayer, all the people confessed, "The Lord He is the God, The Lord He is the God." Pethuel signifies, "persuaded of God." The addition of his father's name distinguished the prophet from others of that name, as the son of Samuel, of king Uzziah, and others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>THE BOOK OF JOEL Commentary by A. R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>Joel (meaning "one to whom Jehovah is God," that is, worshipper of Jehovah) seems to have belonged to Judah, as no reference occurs to Israel; whereas he speaks of Jerusalem, the temple, the priests, and the ceremonies, as if he were intimately familiar with them (compare Joe 1:14; 2:1, 15, 32; 3:1, 2, 6, 16, 17, 20, 21). His predictions were probably delivered in the early days of Joash 870-865 B.C.; for no reference is made in them to the Babylonian, Assyrian, or even the Syrian invasion; and the only enemies mentioned are the Philistines, Phœnicians, Edomites, and Egyptians (Joe 3:4, 19). Had he lived after Joash, he would doubtless have mentioned the Syrians among the enemies whom he enumerates since they took Jerusalem and carried off immense spoil to Damascus (2Ch 24:23, 24). No idolatry is mentioned; and the temple services, the priesthood, and other institutions of the theocracy, are represented as flourishing. This all answers to the state of things under the high priesthood of Jehoiada, through whom Joash had been placed on the throne and who lived in the early years of Joash (2Ki 11:17, 18; 12:2-16; 2Ch 24:4-14). He was the son of Pethuel.<p>The first chapter describes the desolation caused by an inroad of locusts&#8212;one of the instruments of divine judgment mentioned by Moses (De 28:38, 39) and by Solomon (1Ki 8:37). The second chapter (Joe 2:1-11): the appearance of them, under images of a hostile army suggesting that the locusts were symbols and forerunners of a more terrible scourge, namely, foreign enemies who would consume all before them. (The absence of mention of personal injury to the inhabitants is not a just objection to the figurative interpretation; for the figure is consistent throughout in attributing to the locusts only injury to vegetation, thereby injuring indirectly man and beast). Joe 2:12-17: exhortation to repentance, the result of which will be: God will deliver His people, the former and latter rains shall return to fertilize their desolated lands, and these shall be the pledge of the spiritual outpouring of grace beginning with Judah, and thence extending to "all flesh." Joe 2:18-3:21: God's judgments on Judah's enemies, whereas Judah shall be established for ever.<p>Joel's style is pre-eminently pure. It is characterized by smoothness and fluency in the rhythms, roundness in the sentences, and regularity in the parallelisms. With the strength of Micah it combines the tenderness of Jeremiah, the vividness of Nahum, and the sublimity of Isaiah. As a specimen of his style take the second chapter wherein the terrible aspect of the locusts, their rapidity, irresistible progress, noisy din, and instinct-taught power of marshalling their forces for their career of devastation, are painted with graphic reality.   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Joe 1:1-20. The Desolate Aspect of the Country through the Plague of Locusts; the People Admonished to Offer Solemn Prayers in the Temple; for This Calamity Is the Earnest of a Still Heavier One.<p>1.

Who this Pethuel was is not known; Jarchi takes him to be the same with Samuel the prophet, who had a son of this name, <a href="/1_samuel/8-2.htm">1 Samuel 8:2</a>; and gives this reason for his being called Pethuel, because in his prayer he persuaded God; but the long span of time will by no means admit of this, nor the character of Samuel's son agree with Joel; and therefore is rightly denied by Aben Ezra, who observes, however, that this man was an honourable man, and therefore his name is mentioned; and gives this as a rule, that whenever any prophet mentions the name of his father, he was honourable. Perhaps, it is here observed, to distinguish him from another of the same name; and there was one of this name, Joel, a high priest in the reigns of Uzziah and Jotham, according to Seder Olam Zuta (i) and Abarbinel (k); in whose time Joel is by some thought to prophesy. <p>(i) Fol. 104.

Secondly, he threatens greater plagues, because they grow daily to a more hardness of heart and rebellion against God in spite of his punishments. Thirdly, he exhorts them to repentance, showing that it must be earnest, and proceed from the heart, because they had grievously offended God. And in doing this, Joel promises that God will be merciful, and not forget his covenant that he made with their fathers, but will send his Christ, who will gather the scattered sheep, and restore them to life and liberty, even though they seem to be dead.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/joel/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>1.

The name Joel signifies "Jehovah is God," or "whose God is Jehovah." We read in Scripture of several of the same name, but the prophet is distinguished as "the son of Pethuel," a name signifying "the sincerity of God," or "godly simplicity." We are not certain of the exact period at which Joel prophesied, but he is generally believed to have been the earliest prophetic writer of the southern kingdom, and one of the earliest of the twelve minor prophets, while Jonah is generally thought to have been the earliest prophetic writer whose book has found a place in the sacred canon. It is at least certain that Joel preceded Amos, who begins his prophecy with a passage from Joel (comp. <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a> with <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>). and borrows from Joel another towards the close (comp. <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a> with <a href="/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a>). Besides, Joel speaks, in the second chapter, of the plague of locusts as yet future; while Amos, in the fourth chapter of his prophecy, refers to it as past. He likewise prophesied before Isaiah, who also borrows, in <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, a sentence which occurs in <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"They will eat, and not be satisfied; they commit whoredom, and do not increase: for they have left off taking heed to Jehovah." The first clause, which still refers to the priests on account of the evident retrospect in &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; to &#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/4-8.htm">Hosea 4:8</a>, is taken from the threat in <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>. The following word hiznu&#772;, to practise whoredom (with the meaning of the kal intensified as in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>, not to seduce to whoredom), refers to the whole nation, and is to be taken in its literal sense, as the antithesis &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; requires. Pa&#770;rats, to spread out, to increase in number, as in <a href="/exodus/1-12.htm">Exodus 1:12</a> and <a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>. In the last clause  L&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;  belongs to Jehovah: they have given up keeping Jehovah, i.e., giving heed to Him (cf. <a href="/zechariah/11-11.htm">Zechariah 11:11</a>). This applies to the priests as well as to the people. Therefore God withdraws His blessing from both, so that those who eat are not satisfied, and those who commit whoredom do not increase. </body></html>
