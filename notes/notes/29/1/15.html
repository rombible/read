With all the marks of sorrow and shame, sin must be confessed and bewailed. A day is to be appointed for this purpose; a day in which people must be kept from their common employments, that they may more closely attend God's services; and there is to be abstaining from meat and drink. Every one had added to the national guilt, all shared in the national calamity, therefore every one must join in repentance. When joy and gladness are cut off from God's house, when serious godliness decays, and love waxes cold, then it is time to cry unto the Lord. The prophet describes how grievous the calamity. See even the inferior creatures suffering for our transgression. And what better are they than beasts, who never cry to God but for corn and wine, and complain of the want of the delights of sense? Yet their crying to God in those cases, shames the stupidity of those who cry not to God in any case. Whatever may become of the nations and churches that persist in ungodliness, believers will find the comfort of acceptance with God, when the wicked shall be burned up with his indignation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Alas for the day! for the Day of the Lord is at hand - The judgment of God, then, which they were to deprecate, was still to come. : "All times and all days are God's. Yet they are said to be our days, in which God leaves us to our own freedom, to do as we will," and which we may use to repent and turn to Him. "Whence Christ saith, 'O Jerusalem - if thou hadst known in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace' <a href="/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>. That time, on the contrary, is said to be God's Day, in which He doth any new, rare, or special thing, such as is the Day of Judgment or vengeance." All judgment in time is an image of the Judgment for eternity. "The Day of the Lord" is, then, each "day of vengeance in which God doth to man according to His will and just judgment, inflicting the punishment which he deserves, as man did to Him in his day, manifoldly dishonoring Him, according to his own perverse will." That Day "is at hand;" suddenly to come. Speed then must be used to prevent it.

It is not used as a mere name of God, but always in reference to His might, as in the book of Job which treats chiefly of His power . In His days of judgment God manifests Himself as the All-mighty and All-just. Hence, in the New Testament, it occurs almost exclusively in the Revelations, which reveal His judgments to come . Here the words form a sort of terrible proverb, from where they are adopted from Joel by the prophet Isaiah Isa 13:6. The word "destruction, &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;  sho&#770;d," is formed from the same root as "Almighty, &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497;  shadday. It shall come as might from the Mighty." Only, the word "might" is always used of "might" put forth to destroy, a "mighty destruction." He says then, in fact, that that Day shall come, like might put forth by the Almighty Himself; to destroy His enemies, irresistible, inevitable, unendurable, overwhelming the sinner. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. day of the Lord&#8212;(Joe 2:1, 11); that is, the day of His anger (Isa 13:9; Ob 15; Zep 1:7, 15).

It is the Day, when Jehovah is conceived as manifesting Himself in His fulness, striking down wrongdoing and illusion, and giving the final victory to righteousness and truth. The origin of the conception as applied by the prophets, is to be found in Amos’ transformation of a popular idea (see on <a href="/amos/5-18.htm" title="Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.">Amos 5:18</a>). The presentiment of the approach of Jehovah’s Day was often awakened in the minds of the prophets by the prospect of some great political movement among the nations of the earth. In the case of Joel the presentiment is awakened by an extraordinary visitation of Providence. In Joel also the Day of Jehovah is invested, more distinctly than is the case in the earlier prophets, with an eschatological significance: see esp. <a href="/joel/2-31.htm" title="The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.">Joel 2:31</a>, <a href="/context/joel/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,...">Joel 3:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/joel/3-9.htm" title="Proclaim you this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:...">Joel 3:9-17</a>; and comp. above, p. 33.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as</span> <span class="bld">devastation</span> <span class="ital">from the Almighty</span> (Heb. <span class="bld">Shaddai</span>) <span class="ital">shall it come</span>] The phrase is borrowed <span class="ital">verbatim</span> from <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm" title="Howl you; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.">Isaiah 13:6</a> (in the announcement of the doom approaching upon Babylon in b.c. 538) “Howl ye: <span class="ital">for the day of Jehovah is at hand; as devastation from the Almighty shall it come</span>.” In the original there is an effective assonance between <span class="ital">devastation</span> (<span class="ital">shôd</span>), and Almighty (<span class="ital">Shaddai</span>), which might perhaps be preserved, though not with the force and compactness of the Hebrew, by the rendering, <span class="ital">as an</span> <span class="bld">overpowering</span> <span class="ital">from the</span> <span class="bld">Over-powerer</span> <span class="ital">shall it come</span>[31].

T. Theol</span>. p. 214 f.), or in a more historical sense (Bäthgen, <span class="ital">Beiträge zur Sem. Rel.-gesch</span>. 1888, p. 295 f., cf. pp. 192–7), the God who in the patriarchal age was conceived principally as ruling by might (“der naturgewaltige”), but who afterwards through Moses and the prophets revealed more distinctly His ethical and spiritual nature. It is some objection to this view that in actual usage <span class="ital">shâdad</span> always involves the idea of violence; but it is possible that in the age when <span class="ital">Shaddai</span> was formed from it, it had not yet acquired this <span class="ital">nuance</span>, and meant simply <span class="ital">to overpower</span>. Or, perhaps (Wellhausen, <span class="ital">Gesch</span>. 1878, p. 359), <span class="ital">Shaddai</span> denoted originally the <span class="ital">Waster</span>, with reference (see e.g. <a href="/context/job/12-14.htm" title="Behold, he breaks down, and it cannot be built again: he shuts up a man, and there can be no opening....">Job 12:14-25</a>) to the destructive aspects of God’s providence. Other explanations have been suggested; but none that can be said to be more satisfactory[59]. Whatever, however, be the etymology of the title, it is true that the choice of it seems to be sometimes prompted by the thought of the <span class="ital">power</span> of God, whether in the way of blessing and defence (<a href="/genesis/17-1.htm" title="And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>, &c.; <a href="/job/29-5.htm" title="When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;">Job 29:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a>), or in the way of authority, punishment, or trial (<a href="/job/5-17.htm" title="Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not you the chastening of the Almighty:">Job 5:17</a>; <a href="/job/6-4.htm" title="For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="/job/8-3.htm" title="Does God pervert judgment? or does the Almighty pervert justice?">Job 8:3</a>; <a href="/job/21-20.htm" title="His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.">Job 21:20</a>; <a href="/job/27-2.htm" title="As God lives, who has taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who has vexed my soul;">Job 27:2</a>).

Some understand these words as suggested by the prophet to the people, that they might use them in their solemn and sorrowful appeal to the Almighty. This is favoured by the Syriac, which adds, "and say," as if the prophet prescribed to them the substance of their address. We prefer taking them as the prophet's own words, which he era-ploys to justify the urgency of the appeal contained in the two preceding verses to the ministers of religion, the priests, to the magistrates, the elders, and to all the mere-bets of the community, even all the inhabitants of the land. The day referred to is the time of the judgment that was coming on the land through the locusts. The day of the Lord, first mentioned, it is said, by Joel, is the day when he inflicts judgments on sinners, as in the present instance; it may be a presage of that judgment that brought ruin on their city, temple, and nation. It may be an emblem of that judgment that wound up their nation by the destruction of their capital, or even of the final judgment when God shall destroy impenitent sinners and deliver his saints. This day of the Lord comes suddenly, secretly, and irresistibly; and, when it comes, it is a destruction from the Almighty, or, according to the Hebrew paronomasia, <span class="accented">keshod misshaddai</span>, equivalent to "ruin from the Resistless." The day of God's anger against Judah is a presage of that day when, as Judge of all, Jew and Gentile, he will take vengeance on his enemies. Joel's prophetic glance reached onward and forward, not only to the close of the Jewish, but to the conclusion of the Christian, dispensation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the pride of Ephraim will testify against its face, and Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their guilt; Judah has also stumbled with them." As the meaning "to answer," to bear witness against a person, is well established in the case of &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489; (cf. <a href="/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-18.htm">Deuteronomy 19:18</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>), and &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; also occurs in <a href="/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a> in this sense, we must retain the same meaning here, as Jerome and others have done. And there is the more reason for this, because the explanation based upon the lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, "the haughtiness of Israel will be humbled," can hardly be reconciled with &#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;. "The pride of Israel," moreover, is not the haughtiness of Israel, but that of which Israel is proud, or rather the glory of Israel. We might understand by this the flourishing condition of the kingdom, after <a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; but it would be only by its decay that this would bear witness against the sin of Israel, so that "the glory of Israel" would stand for "the decay of that glory," which would be extremely improbable. We must therefore explain "the glory of Israel" here and in <a href="/hosea/7-10.htm">Hosea 7:10</a> in accordance with <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>, i.e., we must understand it as referring to Jehovah, who is Israel's eminence and glory; in which case we obtain the following very appropriate thought: They know not Jehovah, they do not concern themselves about Him; therefore He Himself will bear witness by judgments, by the destruction of their false glory (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10-14</a>), against the face of Israel, i.e., bear witness to their face. This thought occurs without ambiguity in <a href="/hosea/7-10.htm">Hosea 7:10</a>. Israel will stumble in its sin, i.e., will fall and perish (as in <a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>). Judah also falls with Israel, because it has participated in Israel's sin (<a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>). </body></html>
