See what perishing, uncertain things our creature-comforts are. See how we need to live in continual dependence upon God and his providence. See what ruinous work sin makes.

For the word &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; the meaning transgressions is well established by the use of &#1505;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/101-3.htm">Psalm 101:3</a>, where Hengstenberg, Hupfeld, and Delitzsch all agree that this is the proper rendering (see Ewald's philological defence of it at 146, e). In the psalm referred to, however, the expression &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1505;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; also shows that shacha&#774;ta&#770;h is the inf. piel, and se&#772;t&#305;&#772;m the accusative of the object. And it follows from this that shacha&#774;ta&#770;h neither means to slaughter or slaughter sacrifices, nor can be used for &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;&#1492; in the sense of acting injuriously, but that it is to be interpreted according to the sha&#770;chu&#772;th in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16-17</a>, in the sense of stretching, stretching out; so that there is no necessity to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1496; in the sense of &#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1495;, as Delitzsch does, though the use of &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="/hosea/10-9.htm">Hosea 10:9</a> may no doubt be adduced in its support. &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1492; (to turn aside, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12</a>, <a href="/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19</a>), are literally digressions or excesses, answering to the hizna&#770;h in <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/5-3.htm">Hosea 5:3</a>, the leading sin of Israel. "They have deepened to stretch out excesses," i.e., they have gone to great lengths, or are deeply sunken in excesses, - a thought quite in harmony with the context, to which the threat is appended. "I (Jehovah) am a chastisement to them all, to the rulers as well as to the people;" i.e., I will punish them all (cf. <a href="/hosea/5-12.htm">Hosea 5:12</a>), because their idolatrous conduct is well known to me. The way is thus prepared for the two following verses. </body></html>
