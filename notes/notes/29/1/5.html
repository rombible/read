Kimchi comments thus on the place: “You, who accustom yourselves to get drunk with wine, awake out of your sleep, and weep night and day; for the wine shall fail you, because the locust shall devour the grape.” The exhortation implies, that the calamity should particularly affect those who were given to an excess of drinking, and that it should touch them in a tender part; the wine which they loved so well should be cut off from their mouths. Observe, reader, it is just with God to take away those comforts which are abused to luxury and excess.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The most aged could not remember such calamities as were about to take place. Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep - All sin stupefies the sinner. All intoxicate the mind, bribe and pervert the judgment, dull the conscience, blind the soul and make it insensible to its own ills. All the passions, anger, vain glory, ambition, avarice and the rest are a spiritual drunkenness, inebriating the soul, as strong drink doth the body. : "They are called drunkards, who, confused with the love of this world, feel not the ills which they suffer. What then is meant by, "Awake, ye drunkards and weep," but, 'shake off the sleep of your insensibility, and oppose by watchful lamentations the many plagues of sins, which succeed one to the other in the devastation of your hearts?'" God arouse those who will be aroused, by withdrawing from them the pleasures wherein they offended Him. Awake, the prophet cries, from the sottish slumber of your drunkenness; awake to weep and howl, at least when your feverish enjoyments are dashed from your lips. Weeping for things temporal may awaken to the fear of losing things eternal. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The verses before us (vers. 5-7) contain the prophet's appeal to the drunkards. Their sin had not alarmed them; the danger with which their soul was imperilled bad not aroused them; now, however, the heavy visitation that awaited them would affect them more vehemently, touching them more nearly. Deprived of the means of their favourite indulgence, they are urged to awake from their stupid slumber and perilous day-dream. They are summoned to weep, shedding silent but bitter tears, and howl, venting their so,row and disappointment in loud and long lamentation: <span class="cmt_word">Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine!</span> He backs this exhortation by a most cogent and unanswerable reason - because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. The word <span class="accented">asis</span> is explained by Kimchi thus: "Wine is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, and so every kind of drink that goes out (is pressed out) by bruising and treading is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span>, according to the meaning of the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e1;&#x5e1;</span> in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3</a>:21. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/hosea/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I will not visit it upon your daughters that they commit whoredom, nor upon your daughters-in-law that they commit adultery; for they themselves go aside with harlots, and with holy maidens do they sacrifice: and the nation that does not see is ruined." God would not punish the daughters and daughters-in-law for their whoredom, because the elder ones did still worse. "So great was the number of fornications, that all punishment ceased, in despair of any amendment" (Jerome). With &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1501; God turns away from the reckless nation, as unworthy of being further addressed or exhorted, in righteous indignation at such presumptuous sinning, and proceed to speak about it in the third person: for "they (the fathers and husbands, not 'the priest,' as Simson supposes, since there is no allusion to them here) go," etc. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;, piel in an intransitive sense, to separate one's self, to go aside for the purpose of being alone with the harlots. Sacrificing with the qede&#772;sho&#772;th, i.e., with prostitutes, or Hetairai (see at <a href="/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>), may have taken its rise in the prevailing custom, viz., that fathers of families came with their wives to offer yearly sacrifices, and the wives shared in the sacrificial meals (<a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>.). Coming to the altar with Hetairai instead of their own wives, was the climax of shameless licentiousness.
