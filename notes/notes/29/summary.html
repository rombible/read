He then urges them to repent and ask for divine deliverance. The prophet employs this plague as an illustration to predict a future invasion at which time enemy soldiers would cover the land as did the locusts, only to suffer total destruction by the God of Israel Himself.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Bottom Line Introduction</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">INSECTS AND END TIMES: HOW THE FIRST WAS USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE SECOND.<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">Sometime during Joel’s ministry, the land of Judah was struck by a ferocious locust plague, more intense than any experienced before.

For the worst, see Exod. 10:13-15.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Joel is the first biblical prophet to use the phrase, “the day of the Lord,” a title describing the coming seven-year tribulation (1:15).<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> He depicts this terrible period in graphic terms:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>“A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds . . .”</i> (2:2)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>“The earth shall quake . . . the heavens shall tremble; the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withhold their shining”</i> (2:10)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> <i>“And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

This place is thought to be an Old Testament name for the New Testament Kidron Valley (Jn. 18:1), which valley separated the city of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives. In describing this bloody battle, Joel reverses the order of peace and war as depicted by Isaiah.<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Note Isaiah’s words in describing the millennium: <i>“And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”</i> (Isa. 2:4).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Note Joel’s words in describing Armageddon: <i>“Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong”</i> (3:9-10).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> Joel is known as the prophet of Pentecost, because his words about the Holy Spirit were later quoted by Simon Peter on the day of Pentecost (2:28-32).

He not only possesses a singular degree of purity, but is distinguished by his smoothness and fluency; the animated and rapid character of his rhythmus, the perfect regularity of his parallelisms; and the degree of roundness which he gives to his sentences. He has no abrupt transitions, is everywhere connected, and finishes whatever he takes up. In description he is graphic; in arrangement lucid; in imagery original, copious, and varied.” (<i>The Twelve Minor Prophets.”</i> Baker Book House, pp. 90, 91)<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>Amos:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both speak of mountains “dripping” with wine (3:18; Amos 9:13).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both say that the Lord will “roar” from Zion (3:16; Amos 1:2).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both declare that the day of the Lord will be dark, not light (2:2, 10, 31; 3:15; Amos 5:18, 20).<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>Isaiah:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both proclaim that “the day of the Lord” is at hand (1:15; Isa. 13:6) and that it is a day when the sun and moon will not give light (2:10; 3:15; Isa. 13:10).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Both speak of the pouring out of God’s Spirit (2:28; Isa. 32:15; 44:3).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Joel spoke of beating “plowshares into swords” in preparation for Armageddon (3:10).
