The words are easy to read; it is needless to dwell on the horror of the massacre which they describe. We are dealing throughout with the fierce passions of men living in times of gross spiritual darkness; for we cannot doubt that the oath against Jabesh-Gilead was carried out, though the writer drops a veil over all but the result.

There is a fountain in a narrow dale, at a little distance from Shiloh, which was very probably the scene of this event. It is a needless conjecture that the feast was the Passover, and the dances a commemoration of the defeat of the Egyptians, like those of Miriam. There seems to have been no regular town at Shiloh; at least, no extensive ruins are traceable. It was probably a community like the Beth-Micah (see Note on <a href="/judges/18-2.htm" title="And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.">Judges 18:2</a>), which was mainly connected with the service of the Tabernacle. The “daughters of Shiloh” would naturally include many women who were in one way or other employed in various functions about the Tabernacle, and not only those who came there to worship (<a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm" title="Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Samuel 2:22</a>, where “assembled” should be rendered <span class= "ital">served, </span>as in <a href="/numbers/4-23.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:23</a>; “the handmaid” of the priests is mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2Samuel 17:17</a>).

The ban which the assembled tribes had pronounced at Mizpeh seemed to impose on them the necessity of punishing its inhabitants for not joining the crusade against Benjamin; and thus, with a view of repairing the consequences of one rash proceeding, they hurriedly rushed to the perpetration of another, though a smaller tragedy. But it appears (Jud 21:11) that, besides acting in fulfilment of their oath, the Israelites had the additional object by this raid of supplying wives to the Benjamite remnant. This shows the intemperate fury of the Israelites in the indiscriminate slaughter of the women and children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But not the virgins, </span> as appears from the next verses.

But the natural and necessary duty of preserving a tribe from total ruin, might seem to render the case difficult and doubtful, and incline their opinions, as well as their affections, to the more favourable side. And it may be, the Lord, whom they were here consulting with upon all their occasions, gave them a dispensation thus to do, though that be not expressed; which is the case of many other things which were done, though not recorded; as this very oath was omitted in its proper place, and had not been recorded if this extraordinary occasion had not been offered. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And this is the thing that ye shall do,....

They determined that they would carry out the great oath, which had been uttered when the national assembly was called against such as did not appear, upon that one of the tribes of Israel which had not come to the meeting of the congregation at Mizpeh. The deliberations upon this point were opened (<a href="/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>) with the question, "Who is he who did not come up to the meeting of all the tribes of Israel, to Jehovah?" In explanation of this question, it is observed at <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, "For the great oath was uttered upon him that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpeh: he shall be put to death." We learn from this supplementary remark, that when important meetings of the congregation were called, all the members were bound by an oath to appear. The meeting at Mizpeh is the one mentioned in <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>. The "great oath" consisted in the threat of death in the case of any that were disobedient. To this explanation of the question in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-5.htm">Judges 20:5</a>, the further explanation is added in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-7.htm">Judges 21:7</a>, that the Israelites felt compassion for Benjamin, and wished to avert its entire destruction by procuring wives for such as remained. The word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a> is attached to the explanatory clause in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, and is to be rendered as a pluperfect: "And the children of Israel had shown themselves compassionate towards their brother Benjamin, and said, A tribe is cut off from Israel to-day; what shall we do to them, to those that remain with regard to wives, as we have sworn?" etc. (compare <a href="/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1</a>). The two thoughts, - (1) the oath that those who had not come to Mizpeh should be punished with death (<a href="/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>), and (2) anxiety for the preservation of this tribe which sprang from compassion towards Benjamin, and was shown in their endeavour to provide such as remained with wives, without violating the oath that none of them would give them their own daughters as wives, - formed the two factors which determined the course to be adopted by the congregation. After the statement of these two circumstances, the question of <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, "Who is the one (only one) of the tribes of Israel which," etc., is resumed and answered: "Behold, there came no one into the camp from Jabesh in Gilead, into the assembly." &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;&#1497; is used in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-8.htm">Judges 21:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/21-5.htm">Judges 21:5</a>, in a more general sense, as denoting not merely the tribes as such, but the several subdivisions of the tribes.</body></html>
