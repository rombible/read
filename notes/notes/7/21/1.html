Where they were there convened, before the war began; after they had heard the account the Levite gave of the affair, which brought them thither; and after they had sent messengers to Benjamin to deliver up the men of Gibeah, that had committed the wickedness; and after they perceived that Benjamin did not hearken to their demand, but prepared to make war with them; then, as they resolved on the destruction of Gibeah, and of all the cities that sent out men against them, even all the inhabitants of them, men, women, and children, entered into an oath, that they would use those men that remained as Heathens, and not intermarry with them, as follows: <p>saying, there shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife; seeing those that used the wife of the Levite in such a base manner, and those that protected and defended them, deserved to have no wives. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now the men of Israel had <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</span><p>(a) This was a rash oath, and not from judgment: for they later broke it, showing secretly the means to marry certain of their daughters.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">had sworn in Mizpah</span>] Probably, like Jephthah’s vow (<a href="/judges/11-30.htm" title="And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,">Jdg 11:30</a> <span class="ital">n.</span>), a religious oath made at the sanctuary (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.">Jdg 20:1</a>).

They fled therefore towards the north-east; but the battle had overtaken (reached or seized) them, and those out of the towns (had perished). The difficult expression &#1502;&#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, of which very different, and for the most part arbitrary, explanations have been given, can only be in apposition to the suffix attached to the verb: "Benjamin, and in fact those who had come to the help of Gibeah out of the towns of Benjamin" (see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-14.htm">Judges 20:14</a>, <a href="/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15</a>), i.e., all the Benjaminites. The following words, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, are a circumstantial clause explanatory of the previous clause, &#1492;&#1491;&#1489; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;: "since they (the men of Israel) destroyed him (Benjamin) in the midst of it." The singular suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1493; does not refer to Benjamin, as this would yield no sense at all, but to the preceding words, "the way of the desert" (see <a href="/judges/20-45.htm">Judges 20:45</a>). - In <a href="/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43</a> the account is continued by three perfects attached to one another without a copula: "they enclosed (hedged round) Benjamin, pursued him; at the place of rest they trod him down to before Gibeah eastwards." &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; is not used adverbially in the sense of "quietly," which would not give any fitting meaning, but is an accus. loci, and signifies place of rest, as in <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>. The notice "to before Gibeah" refers to all three verbs.</body></html>
