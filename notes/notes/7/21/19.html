The most natural would be the Feast of Tabernacles. We see from <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm" title="And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.">1Samuel 1:3</a> that even among pious families the trying custom of going up to the Tabernacle three times a year had fallen into complete abeyance.<p><span class= "bld">A place which is on the north side of Beth-el . . .—</span>This elaborate description of the site of Shiloh, a place which is so often mentioned elsewhere without any addition, is extremely curious. There can be little doubt that it is due to the marginal gloss of some Masoretic scribe, perhaps in the editing of the sacred books by Ezra. That it is a gloss seems clear, because it comes in as a parenthesis in the speech of the elders, and, of course, in their day such a description was needless. Indeed, it was spoken at Shiloh itself, and the site was well known to all Israel. But by the time that the story was committed to writing in the days of the kings, or finally edited in the days of Ezra, Shiloh had long been desolate, and probably the very site was unknown to thousands. Hence this very valuable and interesting description was added, which has alone enabled us to identify Shiloh in the modern <span class= "ital">Seilûn.</span><p><span class= "bld">South of Lebonah.</span>—Lebonah, now <span class= "ital">Lubban, </span>is not mentioned elsewhere.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/21-19.htm" title="Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.">Jdg 21:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">A feast — </span>Probably it was the feast of tabernacles, which they celebrated with more than ordinary joy. And that feast was the only season at which the Jewish virgins were allowed to dance. But even this was not mixed dancing. No men danced with these daughters of Shiloh. Nor did the married women so forget their gravity as to join with them. However, their dancing thus in public made them an easy prey: whence Bishop Hall observes, “The ambushes of evil spirits carry away many souls from dancing to a fearful desolation.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.

In these unsettled times men went up to Shiloh (Seilun) only once a year <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a> instead of thrice; only the males kept the Feasts, and therefore the virgins of Shiloh would naturally be the only maidens present, and the public festival would be a likely occasion for their festive dances. It is, however, possible that some particular feast unique to Shiloh is meant, like the yearly sacrifice of David's family in Bethlehem <a href="/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem&#8212;The exact site of the place was described evidently for the direction of the Benjamites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Yearly; </span> on the three solemn feasts, in which they used some honest and holy recreations; among which dancing was one, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a> <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm" title="And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.">1 Samuel 18:6</a> <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2 Samuel 6:14</a></span>; and probably it was the feast of tabernacles, which they did celebrate with more than ordinary joy, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:...">Deu 16:13-15</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which is on the north side of Beth-el, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">which is on the north of Beth-el</span>.

Some of the elders that sat in council debating this matter, and considering of ways and means to assist their brethren the Benjaminites, and preserve their tribe from being lost: <p>behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly; where the tabernacle then was, and before which the males of Israel were obliged to appear three times of the year; and this was one of them, as is clear by its being called a feast of the Lord; and therefore cannot design any civil festival or fair kept for trade and commerce. Some have thought of the feast of the passover, but it is most likely to be the feast of tabernacles, as Abarbinel takes it to be; which in Jewish writings is emphatically called "the feast"; and the time of year when that was kept was a time of great rejoicing, on account of the fruits of the earth being gathered in, and the reading of the law and especially at the tithe of drawing of water at this feast; insomuch that it is said (e) that he who never saw the rejoicing at drawing of water never saw rejoicing in his life, which was attended with piping, and dancing, and singing. It is pretty strange what Kimchi notes, that this may be either one of the above feasts, or the day of atonement, at which, he says, the daughters of Israel used to go and dance in the vineyards, according to the words of the Rabbins; when though that is reckoned among the feasts, <a href="/leviticus/23-1.htm">Leviticus 23:1</a> it was properly a fast, as it is called, <a href="/acts/27-9.htm">Acts 27:9</a> and all tokens of festivity and joy were forbidden on it; and where these words of their Rabbins are to be met with, he says not: in a place <p>which is on the north side of Bethel; we rightly supply "in a place": for the intention is not to describe the situation of Shiloh, which was well known, but a place not far from it, where at this festival the daughters of Shiloh used to dance: <p>on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem; this place lay to the east of a public road, that led from Bethel to Shechem: <p>and on the south of Lebonah; which Mr. Maundrell (f) takes to be a place now called Kane Leban, which stands on the east side of a delightful vale, having a village of the same name standing opposite to it on the other side of the vale; one of these places, either that Kane or the village, is supposed to be the Lebonah mentioned <a href="/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a> to which both the name and situation seem to agree. <p>(e) Misn.

The word rendered <span class="ital">feast</span> (<span class="ital">ḥag</span>) strictly implies a pilgrimage to a sanctuary; the three chief <span class="ital">ḥaggim</span> were festivals at which every male Israelite was required to appear before Jehovah (<a href="/context/exodus/23-14.htm" title="Three times you shall keep a feast to me in the year....">Exodus 23:14-17</a>); cf. also the Mohammedan <span class="ital">ḥaj</span> = the pilgrimage to Mecca. What the particular feast here was we are not told; most probably it was a vintage festival to celebrate the ingathering; for this was an occasion of special rejoicing, cf. the Canaanite feast at Shechem <a href="/judges/9-27.htm" title="And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and stepped the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.">Jdg 9:27</a>, and marked the end of the year (September); note that the vines were still in leaf, <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/21-20.htm" title="Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;">Jdg 21:20</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the Lord … in Shiloh</span>] Shiloh was a centre of Jehovah-worship at this early period, <a href="/judges/18-31.htm" title="And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.">Jdg 18:31</a>.

Compare the exactly similar description, <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3, 7</a>. There is a great difference of opinion among commentators as to what feast is here meant. Hengstenberg, Keil, Delitzsch, and others think it was the passover; Bishop Patrick and others think it was the feast of tabernacles, a more joyous feast; Rosenmuller and others think it was a festival peculiar to Shiloh, after the analogy of the yearly sacrifice of the family of Jesse at Bethlehem (<a href="/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>), and more or less in accordance with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10-12</a>. It is not easy to say which view is right, but the last seems not improbable, <span class="cmt_word">In a place which is on the north side</span>, etc. The words <span class="accented">in a place</span> are not in the Hebrew, and do not seem to be implied by the context.

It seems strange that so particular a description of the situation of Shiloh should be given; but it may probably indicate that the writer lived after the tabernacle had been moved to Jerusalem, and Shiloh had relapsed into an obscure village (see <a href="/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). The situation of the descriptive words in the Hebrew, with the pronoun <span class="accented">which</span>, separated from <span class="accented">Shiloh</span> by the word <span class="accented">yearly</span>, indicates that they are an explanation added by the narrator. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The congregation then sent to call the Benjaminites, who had taken refuge upon the rock Rimmon, and gave them as wives, when they returned (sc., into their own possessions), the 400 virgins of Jabesh who had been preserved alive.
