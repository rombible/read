Their victory saddened and humbled them. Their feelings on the occasion were expressed by a public and solemn service of expiation at the house of God. And yet this extraordinary observance, though it enabled them to find vent for their painful emotions, did not afford them full relief, for they were fettered by the obligation of a religious vow, heightened by the addition of a solemn anathema on every violator of the oath. There is no previous record of this oath; but the purport of it was, that they would treat the perpetrators of this Gibeah atrocity in the same way as the Canaanites, who were doomed to destruction; and the entering into this solemn league was of a piece with the rest of their inconsiderate conduct in this whole affair.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The people came to the house of God; </span> partly to mourn for the common loss, and partly to ask counsel from God about the repairing of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the people came to the house of God,....
