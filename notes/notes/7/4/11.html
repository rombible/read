This migration of Heber the Kenite, with a portion of his tribe, from the south of Judah to the north of Naphtali, perhaps caused by Philistine oppression, had clearly taken place recently. It is mentioned here to account for the subsequent narrative, but possibly also because the news of the great muster of the Israelites at Kedesh had been carried to Sisera by some of the tribe <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-12.htm">Judges 4:12</a>, whose tents we are here informed were in the immediate neighborhood of Kedesh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

A descendant of Kain, a principal man among the Midianites; the Targum calls him the Salmaean: <p>which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses; who came along with the children of Israel through the wilderness into the land of Canaan, and first settled about Jericho, and then removed into the wilderness of Judah, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, <p>had severed himself from the Kenites; which dwelt in the said wilderness; to whom he belonged when this separation was made, and on what account is not certain. Abarbinel thinks that it was done now, and with a design to help Israel, that hearing Barak was gone up to Mount Tabor, and seeing Sisera prepared to fight with him, he made as if he was disgusted with his own people, and separated from them, that Jabin, with whom he was at peace, might the more confide in him; when it was out of love to Israel, and with a view to assist them, as occasion should offer, that he removed; but this is not very likely, as these Kenites were a people that kept themselves from meddling with military affairs as much as possible: <p>and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh: for these people dwelt in tents as the Midianites did, from whence they sprung, and as the Scenite Arabs; and yet near to cities, as here, and in places fit for the pasturage of their cattle, in which they were chiefly employed, and here pitched upon a plain where were fields and meadows: the Targum calls it a plain of pools, where were pools of water for the watering of their flocks; or rather it might be rendered the oak or grove of oaks of Zaanaim, the same with Alonzaanannim; see Gill on <a href="/joshua/19-33.htm">Joshua 19:33</a>. This place lay between Harosheth of the Gentiles, from whence Sisera came, and Mount Tabor, where Barak was. This little piece of history is inserted here, partly to account for it that there should be any Kenites here, when we are told before they settled in the wilderness of Judah, and partly on account of the following narrative of Sisera being slain by this man's wife. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now Heber the Kenite, <i>which was</i> of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> unto the plain of Zaanaim, which <i>is</i> by Kedesh.</span><p>(f) Meaning, that he possessed a great part of that country.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Now Heber the Kenite</span>] The verse explains, with a view to <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Jdg 4:17</a></span> ff., how the Kenites, who belonged properly to southern Palestine (see on <a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Jdg 1:16</a>), came to be in this region: the family of Heber had <span class="ital">branched off</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/10-5.htm" title="By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.">Genesis 10:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-32.htm" title="These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.">Genesis 10:32</a>) from the main clan, and pitched their tents as far north as the Tree of Bezaanim (so read, as below), near Kedesh.

Kedesh and Hazor are elements in the story of Jabin (see <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/4-6.htm" title="And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?">Jdg 4:6</a></span> <span class="ital">n.</span>); while Jael, and from her we can hardly separate Heber, belongs to the story of Sisera; yet in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Jdg 4:17</a></span> b Heber is connected with Jabin. The difficulty may be relieved by supposing that the writer who combined the two stories, the writer responsible for making Sisera the general of Jabin’s army <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/4-7.htm" title="And I will draw to you to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.">Jdg 4:7</a></span>, has here confused Kedesh in Naphtali with <span class="ital">another place</span> of the same name, and thus brought Heber into connexion with Jabin, though originally they had nothing to do with each other. Two alternatives as to the position of another Kedesh may be considered.

Heber, with a portion of the tribe, had migrated later to Naphtali, probably at the time When the Philistines were pressing hard upon Judah, in the days of Shamgar and Jael (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a> and Judges 5:5). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At that time the Israelites were judged by Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, who dwelt under the Deborah-palm between Ramah (er Rm: see at <a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>) and Bethel (Beitin: see at <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>) in the tribe of Benjamin, upon the mountains of Ephraim. Deborah is called &#1504;&#1502;&#1497;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; on account of her prophetic gift, like Miriam in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>, and Hulda the wife of Shallum in <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14</a>. This gift qualified her to judge the nation (the participle &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1492; expresses the permanence of the act of judging), i.e., first of all to settle such disputes among the people themselves as the lower courts were unable to decide, and which ought therefore, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>, to be referred to the supreme judge of the whole nation. The palm where she sat in judgment (cf. <a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>) was called after her the Deborah-palm. The Israelites went up to her there to obtain justice. The expression "came up" is applied here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>, to the place of justice, as a spiritual height, independently of the fact that the place referred to here really stood upon an eminence. </body></html>
