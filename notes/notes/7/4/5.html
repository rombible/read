Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself.

Her dwelling house was under a palm tree, or rather she sat under one, in the open air, when the people came to her with their cases, and it was called from hence after her name; though some, as Abarbinel observes, think it was so called, because Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, was buried here, and which was near Bethel, one of the places next mentioned, see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>, <p>between Ramah and Bethel in Mount Ephraim; which places were in the tribe of Benjamin in the borders of Ephraim, see <a href="/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>. The Jews conclude, from the situation of her, that she was a very opulent woman; the Targum is,"she was dwelling in a city in Ataroth, Deborah was supported of her own; she had palm trees in Jericho, orchards in Ramah, olives producing oil in the valley, a place of watering in Bethel, and white dust in the kings mountain:" <p>and the children of Israel came up to her; from all parts of the land to the mount of Ephraim: <p>for judgment: to have her advice and counsel in matters of difficulty, and to have causes between contending parties heard and decided by her, so that she might be truly reckoned among the judges. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah</span>] The marg. <span class="bld">sat</span> is better, cf. <a href="/judges/6-11.htm" title="And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.">Jdg 6:11</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm" title="And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;">1 Samuel 14:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm" title="When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul stayed in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)">1 Samuel 22:6</a>, lit. <span class="ital">she was sitting</span>, i.e. to declare the divine will in disputes and cases of difficulty; hence, it is implied, <span class="ital">the palm tree of Deborah</span> between Ramah (er-Râm) and Beth-el (Beitin), 5 and 12 m. respectively N. of Jerusalem, obtained its name.
