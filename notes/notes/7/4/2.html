Hazor was in the tribe of Naphtali (<a href="/joshua/19-36.htm" title="And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,">Joshua 19:36</a>), and overlooked the waters of Merom (Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. </span>v. 5, § 1). We find from Egyptian inscriptions of Barneses II., &c., that it was a flourishing town in very ancient days. Owing to its importance, it was fortified by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1Kings 9:15</a>). Its inhabitants were taken captive by Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>); and it is last mentioned in <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-27.htm" title="So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them.">1 Maccabees 9:27</a>. (Comp. Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. xiii.</span> 5, § 7.) De Saulcy discovered large and ancient ruins to the north of Merom, which he identifies with this town. The Bishop of Bath and Wells (Lord A. Hervey <span class= "ital">On the Genealogies, </span>p. 28) has pointed out the strange resemblance between the circumstances of this defeat and that recorded in Joshua 11. In both we have a Jabin, king of Hazor; in both there are subordinate kings (<a href="/judges/5-19.htm" title="The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.">Judges 5:19</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,">Joshua 11:1</a>); in both chariots are prominent, which, as we conjecture from <a href="/joshua/11-8.htm" title="And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephothmaim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.">Joshua 11:8</a>, were burnt at Misrephoth-maim (“burnings by the waters”); and in both the general outline of circumstances is the same, and the same names occur in the list of conquered kings (<a href="/context/joshua/11-21.htm" title="And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.">Joshua 11:21-22</a>). This seems to be the reason why Josephus, in his account of the earlier event (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 1, § 18), does not mention either Jabin or Hazor, though strangely enough he says, in both instances, with his usual tendency to exaggeration, that the Canaanites had 300,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and 3,000 chariots. It is again a curious, though it may be an unimportant circumstance, that in <a href="/1_samuel/12-9.htm" title="And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.">1Samuel 12:9</a> the prophet mentions Sisera <span class= "ital">before </span>Eglon. Of course, if the received view of the chronology be correct, we must make the not impossible supposition, that in the century and a half which is supposed to have elapsed since the death of Joshua, Hazor had risen from its obliteration and its ashes (<a href="/joshua/11-11.htm" title="And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.">Joshua 11:11</a>; Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 5, § 4), under a new Canaanite settlement, governed by a king who adopted the old dynastic name. If, on the other hand, there are chronological indications that the whole period of the Judges must be greatly shortened, we may perhaps suppose that the armies of Joshua and Barak combined the full strength of the central and northern tribes in an attack from different directions, which ended in a common victory. In that case, the different tribal records can only have dwelt on that part of the victory in which they were themselves concerned. It is remarkable that even so conservative a critic as Bishop Wordsworth holds “that some of the judges of Israel were only judges of portions of Canaan, and that the years run parallel to those of other judges in other districts of the same country.” If there are difficulties in whatever scheme of chronology we adopt, we must remember the antiquity and the fragmentary nature of the records, which were written with other and far higher views than that of furnishing us with an elaborate consecutive history.<p><span class= "bld">The captain of whose host.</span>—In Eastern narratives it is common for the king to play a very subordinate personal part. In the last campaign of Crœsus we hear much more of Surenas, the general of the Parthians, than of Orodes (Arsaces, 14).<p><span class= "bld">Sisera.</span>—The name long lingered among the Israelites. It occurs again in <a href="/ezra/2-53.htm" title="The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Thamah,">Ezra 2:53</a>, as the name of the founder of a family of Nethinim (minor servants of the Levites, of Canaanite origin, 2 Samuel 21; <a href="/ezra/2-43.htm" title="The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,">Ezra 2:43</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-2.htm" title="Now the first inhabitants that dwelled in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.">1Chronicles 9:2</a>); and in the strange fashion which prevailed among some of the Rabbis of claiming a foreign descent, the great Rabbi Akhivah professed to be descended from Sisera.<p><span class= "bld">Harosheth.</span>—The name means “wood-cutting.” The Chaldee renders it, “In the strength of citadels of the nations.” It was an ingenious and not improbable conjecture of the late Dr. Donaldson, that the town was named from the fact that Sisera made the subject Israelites serve as “hewers of wood” in the cedar-woods and fir-woods of Lebanon.

But the narrative as it proceeds makes it clear that Sisera was an independent chief; the <span class="ital">nine hundred chariots of iron</span> (see <a href="/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jdg 1:19</a> <span class="ital">n.</span>) in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/4-13.htm" title="And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.">Jdg 4:13</a></span> belong to him; like Jabin, he had his own capital, Harosheth, probably Ḥârithîyeh, on the right bank of the Kishon, at the S.W. corner of the Plain of Jezreel, where the chariots could be used with effect. The name Sisera, which occurs again in <a href="/ezra/2-53.htm" title="The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Thamah,">Ezra 2:53</a>, is foreign, cf. the Assyr. <span class="ital">sasur</span> ‘progeny,’ <span class="ital">seseru</span> ‘child’: it may not be Semitic at all; Moore compares the Hittite names ending in -<span class="ital">sira</span>, Ḥtasira, Maurasira (W.

See <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Jabin king of Hazor</span>. The exact site of <span class="accented">Hazor</span> has not been identified with certainty, but it is conjectured by Robinson, with great probability, to have stood on the Tell now called <span class="accented">Khuraibeh</span>, overlooking the waters of Merom (now called Lake Huleh), where are remains of a sepulchre, Cyclopean walls, and other buildings. In <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-14</a> we read of the total destruction by fire of Hazor, and of the slaughter of Jabin, the king thereof, with all the inhabitants of the city, and of the slaughter of all the confederate kings, and the capture of their cities; Hazor, however, "the head of all those kingdoms," being the only one which was "burnt with fire." It is a little surprising, therefore, to read here of another Jabin reigning in Hazor, with confederate kings under him (<a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), having, like his predecessor, a vast number of chariots (cf. <a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3, 13</a> with <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4, 9</a>), and attacking Israel at the head of a great force (cf. <a href="/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7, 13, 16</a> with <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>). It is impossible not to suspect that these are two accounts of the same event. If, however, the two events are distinct, we must suppose that the Canaanite kingdoms had been revived under a descendant of the former king, that Hazor had been rebuilt, and that Jabin was the hereditary name of its king. <span class="cmt_word">Gentiles</span>, or <span class="accented">nations</span>, or <span class="accented">Goim</span>, as <a href="/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>, and <a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>.

Seirah is a place that is never mentioned again; and, judging from the etymology (the hairy), it was a wooded region, respecting the situation of which all that can be decided is, that it is not to be sought for in the neighbourhood of Jericho, but "upon the mountains of Ephraim" (<a href="/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>). For when Ehud had come to Seirah, he blew the trumpet "upon the mountains of Ephraim," to announce to the people the victory that was placed within their reach by the death of Eglon, and to summon them to war with the Moabites, and then went down from the mountain into the plain near Jericho; "and he was before them," i.e., went in front as their leader, saying to the people, "Follow me; for Jehovah has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." Then they went down and took (i.e., took possession of) the fords near Jericho (see at <a href="/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>), &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;, either "from the Moabites" or "towards Moab," and let no one (of the Moabites) cross over, i.e., escape to their own land. </body></html>
