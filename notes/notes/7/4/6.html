There were, therefore, many towns of the name, as Kadesh-Barnea (<a href="/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-23.htm" title="And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,">Joshua 15:23</a>), and Kedesh in Issachar (<a href="/joshua/12-22.htm" title="The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;">Joshua 12:22</a>). Jerusalem is called “the holy, the noble” (<span class= "ital">El kuds, es shereef</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>This sanctuary of Naphtali was a Levitical refuge city in Galilee (<a href="/joshua/19-35.htm" title="And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,">Joshua 19:35</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm" title="And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-32.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.">Joshua 21:32</a>). Josephus says that it was not far from Phœnicia (Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. xiii.</span> 5, § 6). The site of it is probably at Kades, four miles north-west of Lake Merom. The reading of the Syriac and Arabic versions here—<span class= "ital">Rakam</span>—is inexplicable. The fact that the fame of Barak had penetrated from the northern city to the southern limits of Ephraim shows that he must have been a man of great mark.<p><span class= "bld">Draw.</span>—The meaning of the word is uncertain. The Rabbis understand “the people,” others understand “thy steps,” referring to <a href="/genesis/37-21.htm" title="And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.">Genesis 37:21</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-21.htm" title="Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.">Exodus 12:21</a> (Heb.).

There, however, our version gives in the margin the alternative “<span class= "ital">made a long </span>sound with the trumpet,” and the verb is used in that sense in <a href="/exodus/19-13.htm" title="There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.">Exodus 19:13</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.">Joshua 6:5</a>, but there the substantive is added. The word probably implies that Barak is to draw his troops together in small contingents to prevent suspicion.<p><span class= "bld">Mount Tabor.</span>—The broad flat top of this strong, beautiful, and easily fortified mountain (which is nearly a mile in circumference) would serve the double purpose of a watch-post and a stronghold. It was in the district of Issachar, about six miles from Nazareth, and its peculiarities attracted notice in very early days (see <a href="/joshua/19-22.htm" title="And the coast reaches to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.">Joshua 19:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-12.htm" title="The north and the south you have created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your name.">Psalm 89:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-18.htm" title="As I live, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.">Jeremiah 46:18</a>). Josephus calls it Itaburion; he held it for some time successfully against Placidus and the Romans (Jos., <span class= "ital">B. J. </span>iv. 1, § 8). Its huge truncated cone of limestone rises isolated from the plain to the height of nearly nineteen hundred feet, and its sides are clothed with oaks and terebinths. It is now called Jebel et Tur. It was long regarded as the scene of the Transfiguration, but it must yield this glory to Mount Hermon. But the sacred character of the hill seems to be distinctly intimated in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm" title="They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.">Deuteronomy 33:19</a> : “They (Zebulon and Issachar) shall call the people unto the mountains; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness;” <a href="/jeremiah/46-18.htm" title="As I live, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.">Jeremiah 46:18</a> : “As I live, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of Hosts, surely as Tabor is among the mountains . . . so shall he come.”<p><span class= "bld">Of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun.</span>—The northern tribes would feel most painfully the tyranny of Jabin, and these were the two most energetic of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/4-6.htm" title="And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?">Jdg 4:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">Called Barak — </span>By virtue of that power which God had given her, and the people owned in her. <span class="ital">Out of Kedesh-naphtali </span>— So called, to distinguish it from other places of that name, one in Judah, and another in Issachar. <span class="ital">Hath not the Lord, </span>&c. — That is, assuredly God hath commanded thee; this is not the fancy of a weak woman, which peradventure thou mightest despise; but the command of the great God by my mouth, <span class="ital">Mount Tabor — </span>A place most fit for his purpose, as being in the borders of divers tribes, and having a large plain at the top of it, where he might conveniently marshal and discipline his army. <span class="ital">Naphtali and Zebulun — </span>These she names, because they were nearest, and best known to Barak, and therefore would soonest be brought together; because they were nearest, to the enemy, and therefore must speedily be assembled, or else they were likely to be hindered in their design; while the other tribes, being at a distance, had better opportunity of gathering forces for their succour; and because these had most smarted under this oppressor, who was in the heart of their country; but these are not named exclusively, as appears by the concurrence of some other tribes.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:4-9 Deborah was a prophetess; one instructed in Divine knowledge by the inspiration of the Spirit of God. She judged Israel as God's mouth to them; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction, she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it.

It is found also as Barca or Barcas, among Punic proper names. Compare <a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>. On Kedesh-Naphtali see the marginal reference.<p>Deborah speaks of God as Yahweh the God of Israel, because she speaks, as it were, in the presence of the pagan enemies of Israel, and to remind the Israelites, in the day of their distress, that He was ready to perform the mercy promised to their fathers, and to remember His holy covenant. This title, too, would recall to their memories in an instant all His past acts in Egypt, at the Red Sea, in the wilderness, and in the conquest of Canaan.<p>The object of "drawing (toward Mount Tabor" rather, spreading out, compare <a href="/judges/20-37.htm">Judges 20:37</a>) was to effect a junction of the northern tribes with the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin, who were separated from them by the plain of Esdraelon, where Sisera's chariots would naturally congregate and be most effective. Mount Tabor rises from the plain of Esdraelon, about 1,865 ft. above the sea, and its broad top of nearly a mile in circumference afforded a strong position, out of reach of Sisera's chariots. If El Harathiyeh be Harosheth, Sisera must have marched from the west. Harathiyeh is a height in the range which separates Esdraelon from the plains of Acre, under which the Kishon breaks through in its course to the sea. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. she sent and called Barak&#8212;by virtue of her official authority as judge.<p>Kedesh-naphtali&#8212;situated on an eminence, little north of the Sea of Galilee, and so called to distinguish it from another Kedesh in Issachar.<p>Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded?&#8212;a Hebrew form of making an emphatic communication.<p>Go and draw toward mount Tabor&#8212;an isolated mountain of Galilee, northeast corner of the plain of Esdraelon.

N.W. of the lake of Ḥûleh represents the ancient site. But the presence of Kedesh in this chapter raises serious difficulties; the town was too near Hazor, and too far from the scene of the conflict with Sisera, for the muster of Barak’s troops. Probably, therefore, Kedesh is an element in the Jabin-tradition, though how much of the present narrative belongs to that tradition cannot be exactly determined.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mount Tabor</span>] Now Jebel eṭ-Ṭûr, 1843 ft., a prominent feature in the landscape of S.E. Galilee, remarkable for its dome-like shape and apparent isolation. It was the natural rallying-place for Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, whose settlements were in the neighbourhood (cf. <a href="/joshua/19-12.htm" title="And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sun rise to the border of Chislothtabor, and then goes out to Daberath, and goes up to Japhia,">Joshua 19:12</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-22.htm" title="And the coast reaches to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.">Joshua 19:22</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-34.htm" title="And then the coast turns westward to Aznothtabor, and goes out from there to Hukkok, and reaches to Zebulun on the south side, and reaches to Asher on the west side, and to Judah on Jordan toward the sun rise.">Joshua 19:34</a>, which, however, describes the boundaries of a later age); while the position of the mountain, commanding the N.E. quarter of the Great Plain and one of the main outlets to the Jordan, afforded obvious advantages for a descent upon an enemy advancing from the W. across the Plain. A further reason for Barak’s muster on Tabor has been suggested; apparently Issachar and Zebulun had a religious centre there, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm" title="They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.">Deuteronomy 33:19</a> (<span class="ital">the mountain</span> is prob.

Gerlach affirms, as "merely the result of a holy inspiration that suddenly burst forth within him, in which he seized upon the first weapon that came to his hand, and put to flight the enemy when scared by a terror for God, just as Samson did on a later occasion." For he does not seem to have secured for the Israelites any permanent victory over the Philistines. Moreover, he is not called judge, nor is the period of his labours taken into account, but in <a href="/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1</a> the renewed apostasy of Israel from the Lord is dated from the death of Ehud. </body></html>
