The LXX. has the remarkable addition, “Because I know not the day in which the Lord prospers the angel with me.” This is a sort of excuse for his want of perfect faith. He depends on Deborah to give him the immediate augury of victory. “In the Messenian war the soldiers fought bravely because their seers were present” (Pausan. iv. 16—Cassel).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/4-8.htm" title="And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go: but if you will not go with me, then I will not go.">Jdg 4:8</a>. </span><span class="ital">If thou wilt go with me, then I will go — </span>No doubt he thought he had great reason for making this resolution, because he might want her advice in doubtful matters, and her authority also, both to raise men and to keep them together in good order, and likewise to inspire them with courage.

She judged Israel as God's mouth to them; correcting abuses, and redressing grievances. By God's direction, she ordered Barak to raise an army, and engage Jabin's forces. Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it.

Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go&#8212;His somewhat singular request to be accompanied by Deborah was not altogether the result of weakness. The Orientals always take what is dearest to the battlefield along with them; they think it makes them fight better. The policy of Barak, then, to have the presence of the prophetess is perfectly intelligible as it would no less stimulate the valor of the troops, than sanction, in the eyes of Israel, the uprising against an oppressor so powerful as Jabin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> His offer to go with her shows the truth of his faith, for which he is praised, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm" title="And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:">Hebrews 11:32</a></span>; but his refusal to go without her shows the weakness of his faith, that he could not trust God’s bare word, as he ought to have done, without the pledge of the presence of his prophetess, whom he thought God would preserve and deliver, and himself for her sake. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Barak said unto her,....

As the Israelites fell away from the Lord again when Ehud was dead, the Lord gave them into the hand of the Canaanitish king Jabin, who oppressed them severely for twenty years with a powerful army under Sisera his general. The circumstantial clause, "when Ehud was dead," places the falling away of the Israelites from God in direct causal connection with the death of Ehud on the one hand, and the deliverance of Israel into the power of Jabin on the other, and clearly indicates that as long as Ehud lived he kept the people from idolatry (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>), and defended Israel from hostile oppressions. Joshua had already conquered one king, Jabin of Hazor, and taken his capital (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>, <a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). The king referred to here, who lived more than a century later, bore the same name. The name Jabin, "the discerning," may possibly have been a standing name or title of the Canaanitish kings of Hazor, as Abimelech was of the kings of the Philistines (see at <a href="/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>). He is called "king of Canaan," in distinction from the kings of other nations and lands, such as Moab, Mesopotamia, etc. (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8</a>, <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), into whose power the Lord had given up His sinful people. Hazor, once the capital of the kingdoms of northern Canaan, was situated over (above or to the north of) Lake Huleh, in the tribe of Naphtali, but has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>). Sisera, the general of Jabin, dwelt in Harosheth of the Goyim, and oppressed the Israelites most tyrannically (Mightily: cf. <a href="/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>) for twenty years with a force consisting of 900 chariots of iron (see at <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>). The situation of Harosheth, which only occurs here (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-13.htm">Judges 4:13</a>, <a href="/judges/4-16.htm">Judges 4:16</a>), is unknown; but it is certainly to be sought for in one of the larger plains of Galilee, possibly the plain of Buttauf, where Sisera was able to develop his forces, whose strength consisted chiefly in war-chariots, and to tyrannize over the land of Israel. </body></html>
