It contributed in the same way to the defeat of the Turks in the battle of Mount Tabor, April, 1799.

Barak insisted much upon her presence. Deborah promised to go with him. She would not send him where she would not go herself. Those who in God's name call others to their duty, should be ready to assist them in it.

In the early or eastern part of its course, before it is recruited by the springs on Carmel, it is nothing but a torrent, often dry, but liable to swell very suddenly and dangerously, and to overflow its banks in early spring, after rain or the melting of snow. The ground on the banks of the Kishon near Megiddo (Mujedd'a, see <a href="/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a> note) becomes an impassable morass under the same circumstances, and would be particularly dangerous to a large number of chariots. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. she sent and called Barak&#8212;by virtue of her official authority as judge.<p>Kedesh-naphtali&#8212;situated on an eminence, little north of the Sea of Galilee, and so called to distinguish it from another Kedesh in Issachar.<p>Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded?&#8212;a Hebrew form of making an emphatic communication.<p>Go and draw toward mount Tabor&#8212;an isolated mountain of Galilee, northeast corner of the plain of Esdraelon.

As the Israelites fell away from the Lord again when Ehud was dead, the Lord gave them into the hand of the Canaanitish king Jabin, who oppressed them severely for twenty years with a powerful army under Sisera his general. The circumstantial clause, "when Ehud was dead," places the falling away of the Israelites from God in direct causal connection with the death of Ehud on the one hand, and the deliverance of Israel into the power of Jabin on the other, and clearly indicates that as long as Ehud lived he kept the people from idolatry (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>), and defended Israel from hostile oppressions. Joshua had already conquered one king, Jabin of Hazor, and taken his capital (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>, <a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). The king referred to here, who lived more than a century later, bore the same name. The name Jabin, "the discerning," may possibly have been a standing name or title of the Canaanitish kings of Hazor, as Abimelech was of the kings of the Philistines (see at <a href="/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>). He is called "king of Canaan," in distinction from the kings of other nations and lands, such as Moab, Mesopotamia, etc. (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8</a>, <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), into whose power the Lord had given up His sinful people. Hazor, once the capital of the kingdoms of northern Canaan, was situated over (above or to the north of) Lake Huleh, in the tribe of Naphtali, but has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>). Sisera, the general of Jabin, dwelt in Harosheth of the Goyim, and oppressed the Israelites most tyrannically (Mightily: cf. <a href="/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-16.htm">1 Samuel 2:16</a>) for twenty years with a force consisting of 900 chariots of iron (see at <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>). The situation of Harosheth, which only occurs here (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-13.htm">Judges 4:13</a>, <a href="/judges/4-16.htm">Judges 4:16</a>), is unknown; but it is certainly to be sought for in one of the larger plains of Galilee, possibly the plain of Buttauf, where Sisera was able to develop his forces, whose strength consisted chiefly in war-chariots, and to tyrannize over the land of Israel. </body></html>
