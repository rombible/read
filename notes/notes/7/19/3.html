It was situated "in the valley which stretches to Beth-rehob." This valley is the upper part of the Huleh lowland, through which the central source of the Jordan (Leddan) flows, and by which Laish-Dan, the present Tell el Kadi, stood (see at <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>). Beth-rehob is most probably the same place as the Rehob mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>, and the Beth-rehob of <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, which is there used to designate a part of Syria, and for which Rehob only is also used in <a href="/judges/18-8.htm">Judges 18:8</a>. Robinson (Bibl. Res. pp. 371ff.) supposes it to be the castle of Hunin or Honin, on the south-west of Tell el Kadi; but this is hardly correct (see the remarks on <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>, Pent. p. 709). The city, which lay in ashes, was afterwards rebuilt by the Danites, and called Dan, from the name of the founder of their tribe; and the ruins are still to be seen, as already affirmed, on the southern slope of the Tell el Kadi (see Rob. Bibl. Res. pp. 391-2, and the comm. on <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>). </body></html>
