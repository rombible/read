It is probable that the father showed more than usual hospitality, in order to ensure the kind treatment of his daughter by her husband.

The suffix attached to &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493; refers to &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, "to bring back her heart," to turn her to himself again. The Keri &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; is a needless conjecture. "And she brought him into her father's house, and her father received his son-in-law with joy, and constrained him (&#1497;&#1492;&#1494;&#1511;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, lit. held him fast) to remain there three days." It is evident from this that the Levite had succeeded in reconciling his wife. </body></html>
