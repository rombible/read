In the N.T. Belial has become a synonym for Satan, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>, and in this sense the word is used in apocalyptic literature, e.g. <span class="ital">Jubilees, Test. xii. Patriarchs, Sibylline Oracles</span>. Although Belial is not interpreted as a proper name till a late period, yet originally perhaps it had this significance. Cheyne (<span class="ital">Encycl. Bibl</span>. col. 526 f.) seeks the origin of the name in popular mythology, and adopts the derivation <span class="ital">belî-ya‘aleh</span> = ‘(that from which) one comes not up again,’ i.e Sheol, or the demon of the abyss; cf. the Babylonian name for the underworld <span class="ital">irṣît la tari</span> = ‘land without return.’ This explanation is certainly appropriate in <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm" title="The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.">Psalm 18:4</a> = <a href="/2_samuel/22-5.htm" title="When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;">2 Samuel 22:5</a> <span class="ital">floods of Belial</span>, and, with an extension of meaning, in <a href="/psalms/41-8.htm" title="An evil disease, say they, sticks fast to him: and now that he lies he shall rise up no more.">Psalm 41:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/101-3.htm" title="I will set no wicked thing before my eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not stick to me.">Psalm 101:3</a> lit. <span class="ital">a thing of B.</span>, <a href="/nahum/1-11.htm" title="There is one come out of you, that imagines evil against the LORD, a wicked counselor.">Nahum 1:11</a> RVm.; we have then to suppose that the abyss, or the demon of the abyss, came to represent a power or quality of gross wickedness. Cheyne’s view is ingenious and we must allow that the usual explanation rests upon a doubtful etymology.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beset the house … know him</span>] The same words in <a href="/context/genesis/19-4.htm" title="But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:...">Genesis 19:4-5</a>. It looks as if the present narrative had been deliberately conformed here and there to the description of the immorality of the Sodomites. This is certainly the case in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/19-24.htm" title="Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.">Jdg 19:24</a></span>, where the phrases are identical with those in <a href="/genesis/19-8.htm" title="Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do you to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.">Genesis 19:8</a>. Some scholars think that the present verse originally read <span class="ital">Bring forth the woman … that we may know her</span>, chiefly on the ground that in <a href="/judges/20-5.htm" title="And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about on me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.">Jdg 20:5</a> the Levite does not allude to the particular crime mentioned in the text as it stands, but declares that the men of Gibeah wanted to <span class="ital">slay</span> him. The inconsistency may be more apparent than real. After what happened to the woman, the Levite might well assert that the intention was to kill him, while he would hardly repeat the expression used here.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Making their hearts merry</span> - as in vers. 6, 9, and in <a href="/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>; <a href="/ruth/3-7.htm">Ruth 3:7</a>. But there is nothing in the expression implying any excess in drinking. <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth the man</span>. The abandoned character of the men appears in this, that not only did they offer no hospitality to the stranger themselves, but were ready to violate the sanctity of the hospitality of the old man's house by their brutal violence. There must have been a fearful absence of all law and order and government when such deeds could be done without any interference on the part of magistrate or elder or ruler of any kind. The singular resemblance of the whole narrative to that in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. suggests that the Israelites by their contact with the accursed Canaanites had reduced themselves to the level of Sodom and Gomorrah. Surely this shows the wisdom of the command to destroy utterly the workers of abomination. <span class="cmt_word">Sons of Belial</span>. See <a href="/judges/20-13.htm">Judges 20:13</a>, where the same Hebrew phrase is rendered <span class="accented">children of Belial.</span> Belial in this common phrase is not a proper name, but a noun meaning <span class="accented">worthlessness. </span> Sons or men of Belial means worthless fellows. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Behold, there came an old man from the field, who was of the mountains of Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger in Gibeah, the inhabitants of which were Benjaminites (as is observed here, as a preliminary introduction to the account which follows). When he saw the traveller in the market-place of the town, he asked him whither he was going and whence he came; and when he had heard the particulars concerning his descent and his journey, he received him into his house. &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>), "and I walk at the house of Jehovah, and no one receives me into his house" (Seb. Schm., etc.); not "I am going to the house of Jehovah" (Ros., Berth., etc.), for &#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; does not signify to go to a place, for which the simple accusative is used either with or without &#1492; local. It either means "to go through a place" (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>, etc.), or "to go with a person," or, when applied to things, "to go about with anything" (see <a href="//biblehub.com/job/31-5.htm">Job 31:5</a>, and Ges. Thes. p. 378). Moreover, in this instance the Levite was not going to the house of Jehovah (i.e., the tabernacle), but, as he expressly told the old man, from Bethlehem to the outermost sides of the mountains of Ephraim. The words in question explain the reason why he was staying in the market-place. Because he served at the house of Jehovah, no one in Gibeah would receive him into his house, <p>(Note: As Seb. Schmidt correctly observes, "the argument is taken from the indignity shown him: the Lord thinks me worthy to minister to Him, as a Levite, in His house, and there is not one of the people of the Lord who thinks me worthy to receive his hospitality.")<p>although, as he adds in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19-19.htm">Judges 19:19</a>, he had everything with him that was requisite for his wants. "We have both straw and fodder for our asses, and bread and wine for me and thy maid, and for the young man with thy servants. No want of anything at all," so as to cause him to be burdensome to his host. By the words "thy maid" and "thy servants" he means himself and his concubine, describing himself and his wife, according to the obsequious style of the East in olden times, as servants of the man from whom he was expecting a welcome.</body></html>
