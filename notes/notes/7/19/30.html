The text of the latter passage is uncertain and difficult; â€˜their two transgressionsâ€™ is generally taken as an allusion to the want of hospitality and the immoral conduct of the men of Gibeah.

The connexion between (3) and (4) is illustrerprets â€˜the days of Gibeahâ€™ as referring to the setting up of the kingdom in Gibeah in the time of Saul; and some modern scholars accept this view. It is true that Israel, which avenged the crime with such righteous zeal, could not fairly be blamed for it; on the other hand, the Benjamites of Gibeah formed a part of Israel, and the entire nation would, in accordance with ancient ideas, be considered as involved in the guilt (cf. <a href="/judges/20-10.htm" title="And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.">Jdg 20:10</a> b).
