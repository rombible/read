Receive it from him, use it for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of this message shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books of Moses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable. Those who possess the most courageous faith, will be the most disposed for peace, and the readiest to make advances to obtain; but rapacity and ambition often cloak their designs under a plea of equity, and render peaceful endeavours of no avail.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Into my place - This expression implies that the trans-Jordanic possessions of Israel were not included in the land of Canaan properly speaking.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the king of Ammon &#8230;, Because Israel took away my land&#8212;(See on [221]De 2:19). The subject of quarrel was a claim of right advanced by the Ammonite monarch to the lands which the Israelites were occupying. Jephthah's reply was clear, decisive, and unanswerable;&#8212;first, those lands were not in the possession of the Ammonites when his countrymen got them, and that they had been acquired by right of conquest from the Amorites [Jud 11:21]; secondly, the Israelites had now, by a lapse of three hundred years of undisputed possession, established a prescriptive right to the occupation [Jud 11:22, 23]; and thirdly, having received a grant of them from the Lord, his people were entitled to maintain their right on the same principle that guided the Ammonites in receiving, from their god Chemosh, the territory they now occupied [Jud 11:24]. This diplomatic statement, so admirable for the clearness and force of its arguments, concluded with a solemn appeal to God to maintain, by the issue of events, the cause of right and justice [Jud 11:27].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So Sihon was the aggressor or beginner of the war; and the Israelites were forced to it for their own defence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through, his coast,....
