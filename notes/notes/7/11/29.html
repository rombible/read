There may be remainders of distrust and doubting, even in the hearts of true and great believers. 2. Our vows to God should not be as a purchase of the favour we desire, but to express gratitude to him. 3. We need to be very well-advised in making vows, lest we entangle ourselves. 4. What we have solemnly vowed to God, we must perform, if it be possible and lawful, though it be difficult and grievous to us. 5. It well becomes children, obediently and cheerfully to submit to their parents in the Lord. It is hard to say what Jephthah did in performance of his vow; but it is thought that he did not offer his daughter as a burnt-offering. Such a sacrifice would have been an abomination to the Lord; it is supposed she was obliged to remain unmarried, and apart from her family. Concerning this and some other such passages in the sacred history, about which learned men are divided and in doubt, we need not perplex ourselves; what is necessary to our salvation, thanks be to God, is plain enough. If the reader recollects the promise of Christ concerning the teaching of the Holy Spirit, and places himself under this heavenly Teacher, the Holy Ghost will guide to all truth in every passage, so far as it is needful to be understood.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the Spirit of the Lord ... - This was the sanctification of Jephthah for his office of Judge and savior of God's people Israel. Compare <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>. The declaration is one of the distinctive marks which stamp this history as a divine history.<p>The geography is rather obscure, but the sense seems to be that Jephthah first raised all the inhabitants of Mount Gilead; then he crossed the Jabbok into Manasseh, and raised them; then he returned at the head of his new forces to his own camp at Mizpeh to join the troops he had left there; and thence at the head of the whole army marched against the Ammonites, who occupied the southern parts of Gilead. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 11:29-31. His Vow.<p>29, 30. Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah&#8212;The calm wisdom, sagacious forethought, and indomitable energy which he was enabled to display, were a pledge to himself and a convincing evidence to his countrymen, that he was qualified by higher resources than his own for the momentous duties of his office.<p>he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh&#8212;the provinces most exposed and in danger, for the purpose of levying troops, and exciting by his presence a widespread interest in the national cause. Returning to the camp at Mizpeh, he then began his march against the enemy. There he made his celebrated vow, in accordance with an ancient custom for generals at the outbreak of a war, or on the eve of a battle, to promise the god of their worship a costly oblation, or dedication of some valuable booty, in the event of victory. Vows were in common practice also among the Israelites. They were encouraged by the divine approval as emanating from a spirit of piety and gratitude; and rules were laid down in the law for regulating the performance. But it is difficult to bring Jephthah's vow within the legitimate range (see on [222]Le 27:28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah; </span> endued him with a more than ordinary courage and resolution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Manasseh, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">Bashan</span>, which the half tribe of Manasseh, beyond Jordan, inhabited, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/20-8.htm" title="And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness on the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.">Joshua 20:8</a> 21:6</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Mizpeh of Gilead; </span> so called, to distinguish it from other cities of that name.

The spirit of strength, as the Targum; of fortitude of mind, of uncommon valour and courage, and of zeal for God and Israel, and against their enemies; such a spirit as used to be given to men, when they were in an extraordinary manner raised up by the Lord, to be judges, saviours, and deliverers of his people; so that as Jephthah was before chosen by the people to be the general and head of the tribes beyond Jordan, he was raised up and qualified by the Lord now to be the judge of all Israel; of which the Spirit of the Lord coming on him was a sufficient proof and evidence: <p>and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh; the countries that belonged to Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh; however, all that part of it which lay from the place where he was, to the land of the children of Ammon: <p>and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead; which lay to the north of the land of Gilead, or tribe of Gad: <p>and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon; did not stay for them, to bring on the war in the land of Gilead, but prevented it by carrying it into the land of the children of Ammon.

The suffix to &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; refers to &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;, the Amorites, i.e., their land. The construction of &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with the accusative of the people (as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-21.htm">Deuteronomy 2:21-22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>) may be explained on the simple ground, that in order to take possession of a country, it is necessary first of all to get the holders of it into your power. Jephthah then proved still further how unwarrantable the claim of the king of the Ammonites was, and said to him (<a href="/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>), "Is it not the fact (&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, nonne), that what thy god Chemosh gives thee for a possession, of that thou takest possession; and all that Jehovah makes ownerless before us, of that we take possession?" - an appeal the validity of which could not be disputed. For Chemosh, see at <a href="/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>. The verb &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; combines the three meanings: to drive out of a possession, to deprive of a possessor, and to give for a possession; inasmuch as it is impossible to give a land for a possession without driving away or exterminating its former possessor.</body></html>
