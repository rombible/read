Now the period covered by these genealogies includes the judgeship of Samuel and the reign of Saul—at least seventy years; and seven or eight generations cannot possibly span 370 years. The hypothesis that in <span class= "ital">all </span>these genealogies—even the four times repeated genealogy of David—generations are always omitted is very improbable. The chronology of the Jews is confessedly loose and uncertain, and it seems quite possible that “three hundred years” may be a marginal gloss which has crept into the text. What makes this more probable is that the words not only create an immense chronological difficulty, but (1) are quite needless to Jephthah’s argument, and (2) actually conflict with the rest of the sentence, which refers <span class= "ital">to </span>Balak alone; the argument being, If Balak, “<span class= "ital">at </span>that time” (as the words should be rendered), did not advance any claim, what right have you to do so <span class= "ital">now? </span>If, however, in spite of these difficulties, the clause be genuine, and if there has not been one of the clerical errors which are so common where numerals are concerned, it seems possible that 300 years may be counted inclusively, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>100 full years since the death of Joshua and nominal completion of the conquest of Canaan, with parts of a century before and after it. Certainly this is a recognised mode of reckoning time among the Jews. For instance, if a king began to reign on December 30, 1879, and died on January 2, 1881, they would say that he had reigned three years. Whatever explanations we may adopt, there is nothing but conjecture to go upon. (See Introduction.)<p><span class= "bld">Within that time.</span>—This is a mistranslation, due probably to the perplexity caused by the “three hundred years.” The Hebrew has “in that time,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>at that crisis.

Receive it from him, use it for him, and part with it when he calls for it. The whole of this message shows that Jephthah was well acquainted with the books of Moses. His argument was clear, and his demand reasonable.

Jephthah's reply was clear, decisive, and unanswerable;&#8212;first, those lands were not in the possession of the Ammonites when his countrymen got them, and that they had been acquired by right of conquest from the Amorites [Jud 11:21]; secondly, the Israelites had now, by a lapse of three hundred years of undisputed possession, established a prescriptive right to the occupation [Jud 11:22, 23]; and thirdly, having received a grant of them from the Lord, his people were entitled to maintain their right on the same principle that guided the Ammonites in receiving, from their god Chemosh, the territory they now occupied [Jud 11:24].

Moreover, since ‘Aroer and her towns’ were situated on the north side of the Arnon, the words which follow in the present text, ‘and in all the cities that are along by the side of Arnon,’ add nothing to the description; <span class="ital">Jordan</span> gives us exactly what is wanted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">three hundred years</span>] The total number of years assigned to the oppressions and to the periods of the Judges in the preceding chapters comes to 319, or, omitting the Ammonite oppression, to 301.

The Septuagint for <span class="accented">Arnon</span> reads <span class="accented">Jordan</span>, which was the western boundary, as Arnon was the southern (ver. 22). The corresponding description in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a> is, <span class="accented">From Aroer</span>, <span class="accented">which is by the brink of the river of Arnon</span>, <span class="accented">and from the city that is by the river</span>, <span class="accented">even unto Gilead</span>:, <span class="accented">there was not owe city too strong for us</span>: <span class="accented">the Lord our God delivered all unto us. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Three hundred years</span>. These words seem quite unintelligible and out of place. They are also chronologically impracticable. One expects the number of the cities, as in ver. 33, rather than the number of years; and it is remarkable that the whole number of cities taken by the Israelites on the east of Jordan must have been just about 300, since the half-tribe of Manasseh had sixty. If Gad and Reuben had the same proportion, it would be exactly 300 (5 &times; 60). <span class="cmt_word">Within that time</span>. The Hebrew phrase, which occurs about seventy times, invariably means <span class="accented">at that time</span>, and here can only refer to the time of the first settlement in the days of Balak, of which he had been speaking - another proof that the enumeration <span class="accented">three hundred years</span> is out of place here. If the reading <span class="accented">years is</span> not, as above suggested, an error for <span class="accented">cities</span>, the whole sentence, <span class="accented">three hundred years</span>, may very probably be an interpolation by a professed chronologist. The adding up of all the numbers of the servitudes and rests given in the book gives 301 years from the commencement of the oppression by Chushan-rishathaim to the death of Jair. But this method of reckoning gives the impossible period of 600 years from the exodus to the building of the temple. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-19.htm">Judges 11:19-22</a> are almost verbatim the same as <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-25</a>.

"Into my place," i.e., into the land of Canaan, that Jehovah has appointed for me. But Sihon "trusted not Israel to pass through his land," i.e., he did not trust to the assurance of Israel that they only wanted to pass peaceably through his land, but supposed the petition to cover an intention to take forcible possession of it.

But he was defeated, and lost all his land, from the Arnon (Mojeb) on the south to the Jabbok (Zerka) on the north, and from the desert on the east to the Jordan on the west, of which the Israelites took possession.</body></html>
