To say that he imagined that <span class= "ital">an animal </span>would “come forth of the doors of his house to meet him” on his triumphant return is a notion which even St. Augustine ridicules. The offer to sacrifice a single animal—even if we <span class= "ital">could </span>suppose an animal “coming forth to meet” Jephthah—would be strangely inadequate. It would be assumed as a matter of course that not one, but <span class= "ital">many </span>holocausts of animals would express the gratitude of Israel. Pfeiffer sensibly observes (<span class= "ital">Dub. vexata, </span>p. 356): “What kind of vow would it be if some great prince or general should say, ‘O God, if Thou wilt give me this victory, the first calf that meets me shall be Thine?’” Jephthah left God, as it were, to choose His own victim, and probably anticipated that it would be some slave. The notion of human sacrifice was all but universal among ancient nations, and it was specially prevalent among the Syrians, among whom Jephthah had lived for so many years, and among the Phœnicians, whose gods had been recently adopted by the Israelites (<a href="/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>). Further than this, it was the peculiar worship of the Moabites and Ammonites, against whom Jephthah was marching to battle; and one who had been a rude freebooter, in a heathen country and a lawless epoch, when constant and grave violations of the Law were daily tolerated, might well suppose in his ignorance that Jehovah would need to be propitiated by some offering as costly as those which bled on the altars of Chemosh and Moloch. Human sacrifice had been “the first thought of Balak in the extremity of his terror” (<a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a>), and “the last expedient of Balak’s successor” (<a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.">2Kings 3:27</a>)—Stanley, i. 358. If it be urged that after the great lesson which had been taught to Abraham at Jehovah-jireh the very notion of human sacrifice ought to have become abhorrent to any Israelite, especially as it had been expressly forbidden in the Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm" title="You shall not do so to the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, &c), one more than sufficient answer is that <span class= "ital">even in the wilderness </span>Israel had been guilty of Moloch-worship (<a href="/ezekiel/20-26.htm" title="And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm" title="Concerning the Ammonites, thus said the LORD; Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?">Jeremiah 49:1</a>; <span class= "ital">Melcom, </span><a href="/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a>; <a href="/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a>). The Law was one thing; the knowledge of it and the observance of it was quite another. During this period we find the Law violated again and again, even by judges like Gideon and Samson; and the tendency to violate it by human sacrifices lasted down to the far more enlightened and civilised days of Ahaz and Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm" title="And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he worked much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2Chronicles 33:6</a>). Indeed, we find the priests expressly sanctioning, even in the palmiest days of David’s reign, an execution which, to the vulgar, would bear an aspect not far removed from human sacrifice, or (rather) which might easily be confused with the spirit which led to it (<a href="/context/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2Samuel 21:1-9</a>). If, again, it be said that the possibility of Jephthah’s being guilty of so rash and evil a vow is excluded by the phrase that “the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,” such reasoning is to substitute idle fancies for clear facts. The Spirit of the Lord “clothed” Gideon, yet he set up an illegal worship. The “Spirit of the Lord” came upon Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm" title="And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.">1Samuel 19:23</a>), yet Saul contemplated slaying his own son out of regard for no less foolish a vow (<a href="/1_samuel/14-44.htm" title="And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.">1Samuel 14:44</a>). The “Spirit of the Lord” came upon David <span class= "ital">“</span>from that day forward” on which Samuel anointed him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm" title="Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the middle of his brothers: and the Spirit of the LORD came on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.">1Samuel 16:13</a>), yet he could sink into adultery and murder. The phrase must not be interpreted of high or permanent spiritual achievement, but of Divine strength granted for a particular end.<p><span class= "bld">And I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</span>—The margin gives the alternative reading <span class= "ital">or </span>instead of <span class= "ital">and. </span>This is due to the same feeling which made our translators adopt the rendering <span class= "ital">“whatsoever.” </span>They are practically following R. Kimchi in the attempt to explain away, out of deference to modern notions, the plain meaning of the Bible. It is true that <span class= "ital">vau, </span>“and,” is sometimes <span class= "ital">practically </span>disjunctive (or, rather, is used where a disjunctive might be used), but to take it so here is to make nonsense of the clause, for if any person or thing was made “a burnt offering” it was necessarily “the Lord’s” (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm" title="Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.">Exodus 13:2</a>, &c.), so that there <span class= "ital">can </span>be no <span class= "ital">alternative </span>here. The “and” is exactly analogous to the “and” between the two clauses of Jacob’s (<a href="/context/genesis/28-21.htm" title="So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:">Genesis 28:21-22</a>) and of Hannah’s vow (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1Samuel 1:11</a>).

This is Mr. Locke’s opinion, in his gloss upon the place.” See the note on <a href="/context/judges/11-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man.

There may be remainders of distrust and doubting, even in the hearts of true and great believers. 2. Our vows to God should not be as a purchase of the favour we desire, but to express gratitude to him. 3. We need to be very well-advised in making vows, lest we entangle ourselves. 4. What we have solemnly vowed to God, we must perform, if it be possible and lawful, though it be difficult and grievous to us. 5. It well becomes children, obediently and cheerfully to submit to their parents in the Lord. It is hard to say what Jephthah did in performance of his vow; but it is thought that he did not offer his daughter as a burnt-offering. Such a sacrifice would have been an abomination to the Lord; it is supposed she was obliged to remain unmarried, and apart from her family. Concerning this and some other such passages in the sacred history, about which learned men are divided and in doubt, we need not perplex ourselves; what is necessary to our salvation, thanks be to God, is plain enough. If the reader recollects the promise of Christ concerning the teaching of the Holy Spirit, and places himself under this heavenly Teacher, the Holy Ghost will guide to all truth in every passage, so far as it is needful to be understood.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words of this verse prove conclusively that Jephthah intended his vow to apply to human beings, not animals: for only one of his household could be expected to come forth from the door of his house to meet him. They also preclude any other meaning than that Jephthah contemplated a human sacrifice. This need not, however, surprise us, when we recollect his Syrian birth and long residence in a Syrian city, where such fierce rites were probably common. The Syrians and Phoenicians were conspicuous among the ancient pagan nations for human sacrifices, and the transfer, under such circumstances, to Yahweh of the rites with which the false gods were honored, is just what one might expect. The circumstance of the Spirit of the Lord coming on Jephthah <a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a> is no difficulty; as it by no means follows that because the Spirit of God endued him with supernatural valor and energy for vanquishing the Ammonites, He therefore also endued him with spiritual knowledge and wisdom. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, but that did not prevent his erring in the matter of the ephod <a href="/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a>. Compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me&#8212;This evidently points not to an animal, for that might have been a dog; which, being unclean, was unfit to be offered; but to a person, and it looks extremely as if he, from the first, contemplated a human sacrifice. Bred up as he had been, beyond the Jordan, where the Israelitish tribes, far from the tabernacle, were looser in their religious sentiments, and living latterly on the borders of a heathen country where such sacrifices were common, it is not improbable that he may have been so ignorant as to imagine that a similar immolation would be acceptable to God. His mind, engrossed with the prospect of a contest, on the issue of which the fate of his country depended, might, through the influence of superstition, consider the dedication of the object dearest to him the most likely to ensure success.<p>shall surely be the Lord's; and [or] I will offer it up for a burnt offering&#8212;The adoption of the latter particle, which many interpreters suggest, introduces the important alternative, that if it were a person, the dedication would be made to the service of the sanctuary; if a proper animal or thing, it would be offered on the altar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me,....

It is unnecessary to mention the various expedients which have been adopted in order to escape the plain meaning of the words. Nothing is said about Jephthah’s rashness; nor are we told that there was anything displeasing to Jehovah in the nature of the vow; the narrative emphasizes in the issue the grief of Jephthah and the pitiful fate of his daughter. At a crisis or under the influence of despair, when ordinary sacrifices seemed unavailing and at all costs the divine help must be secured, Semitic religion had recourse to human sacrifices. Among the Hebrews in the rude, early days such a sacrifice was possible (as here), but in time it was felt to be contrary to the spirit of the religion of Jehovah (Genesis 22); the hideous practice revived, however, in the period of Ahaz and Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm" title="But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm" title="And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2 Kings 17:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm" title="And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.">2 Kings 21:6</a> etc., <a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a>), and was denounced by the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a> etc., <a href="/ezekiel/16-20.htm" title="Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured.

"And now art thou better than Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab? Did he strive (&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;, inf. abs. of &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; or &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) with Israel, or did he fight against them?"

Balak, the king of the Moabites, had indeed bribed Balaam to destroy Israel by his curses; but he did so not so much with the intention of depriving them of the territory of the Amorites which they had conquered, as from the fear that the powerful Israelites might also conquer his still remaining kingdom. Balak had neither made war upon Israel on account of the territory which they had conquered from the Amorites, nor had he put forward any claim to it as his own property, which he certainly might have done with some appearance of justice, as a large portion of it had formerly belonged to the Moabites (see <a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a> and the comm. on this passage). If therefore Balak the king of the Moabites never thought of looking upon this land as being still his property, or of asking it back from the Israelites, the king of the Ammonites had no right whatever to lay claim to the land of Gilead as belonging to him, or to take it away from the Israelites by force, especially after the lapse of 300 years. "As Israel dwells in Heshbon, ... and in all the cities by the side of the Arnon for three hundred years, why have ye not taken away (these towns and lands) within that time" (i.e., during these 300 years)? If the Ammonites had had any right to it, they ought to have asserted their claim in Moses' time. It was much too late now, after the expiration of 300 years. For "if no prescriptive right is to be admitted, on account of length of time, and if long possession gives no title, nothing would ever be held in safety by any people, and there would be no end to wars and dissension" (Clericus). On Heshbon and its daughters, see at <a href="/numbers/21-25.htm">Numbers 21:25</a>. Aror (&#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;, another form for &#1506;&#1512;&#1506;&#1512;, or possibly only a copyist's error) is Aror of Gad, before Rabbah (<a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), and is to be sought for in the Wady Nahr Ammn, on the north-east of Ammn (see at Josh. l. c.), not Aror of Reuben, on the border of the valley of Arnon (<a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>). This is evident from the fact, that it is distinguished from "all the cities on the side (&#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;, see at <a href="/numbers/34-3.htm">Numbers 34:3</a>) of the Arnon," which included Aror of Reuben. Aror of Gad, with its daughter towns, was probably Ammonitish territory before the time of Sihon. On the 300 years, a round number that comes very near the reality, see the Chronol. p. 285.</body></html>
