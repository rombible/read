God had forgiven Israel, therefore Jephthah will forgive. He speaks not with confidence of his success, knowing how justly God might suffer the Ammonites to prevail for the further punishment of Israel. Nor does he speak with any confidence at all in himself. If he succeed, it is the Lord delivers them into his hand; he thereby reminds his countrymen to look up to God as the Giver of victory. The same question as here, in fact, is put to those who desire salvation by Christ. If he save you, will ye be willing that he shall rule you? On no other terms will he save you. If he make you happy, shall he make you holy? If he be your helper, shall he be your Head? Jephthah, to obtain a little worldly honour, was willing to expose his life: shall we be discouraged in our Christian warfare by the difficulties we may meet with, when Christ has promised a crown of life to him that overcometh?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The history of Jephthah appears to be an independent history inserted by the compiler of the Book of Judges.

Jephthah, the son of Gilead by a strange woman, fled, after his father's death, to the land of Tob <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>, presumably the land of his maternal ancestors (compare <a href="/judges/9-1.htm">Judges 9:1</a>) and an "Aramean" settlement (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a>; 1 Macc. 5:13). It is difficult to conceive that Jephthah was literally the son of Gilead, if Gilead was the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh. Possibly "Gilead" here denotes the heir of Gilead, the head of the family, whose individual name has not been preserved, nor the time when he lived. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Whenever Gilead lived, besides the son by the foreign harlot, whom Jephthah represented, he had sons and descendants by his legitimate wife, who claimed to be his sole heirs, and who therefore drove Jephthah from the inheritance of their father's house. They might, as far as the language used is concerned, have been Gilead's own sons, or they may have been his grandsons or great-grandsons, and so either the brothers or the cousins and fellow-tribesmen of Jephthah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Therefore the Lord would not save them any more. They might get help from the gods whom they had chosen for themselves. The Israelites should now experience what Moses had foretold in his song (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37-38</a>). This divine threat had its proper effect. The Israelites confessed their sins, submitted thoroughly to the chastisement of God, and simply prayed for salvation; nor did they content themselves with merely promising, they put away the strange gods and served Jehovah, i.e., they devoted themselves again with sincerity to His service, and so were seriously converted to the living God. "Then was His (Jehovah's) soul impatient (&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1510;&#1512;, as in <a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>) because of the troubles of Israel;" i.e., Jehovah could no longer look down upon the misery of Israel; He was obliged to help. The change in the purpose of God does not imply any changeableness in the divine nature; it simply concerns the attitude of God towards His people, or the manifestation of the divine love to man. In order to bend the sinner at all, the love of God must withdraw its helping hand and make men feel the consequences of their sin and rebelliousness, that they may forsake their evil ways and turn to the Lord their God. When this end has been attained, the same divine love manifests itself as pitying and helping grace. Punishments and benefits flow from the love of God, and have for their object the happiness and well-being of men.</body></html>
