Gideon saw that by human strength alone he would be utterly helpless to repel the countless hosts of the marauders. He had already shown his faith, but now he needed fresh encouragement in his dangerous task.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:33-40 These signs are truly miraculous, and very significant. Gideon and his men were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made to know that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divine grace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause we sinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew of heavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all the inhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in different measures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation, one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dry ground.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The caution of Gideon, desirous of being assured that he really had a promise from God, does not imply doubts as to God's faithfulness or power to fulfill His promise. Of such doubts there is not a trace in Gideon's character. He is a worthy example of faith <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon&#8212;Called in this sudden emergency into the public service of his country, he was supernaturally endowed with wisdom and energy commensurate with the magnitude of the danger and the difficulties of his position. His summons to war was enthusiastically obeyed by all the neighboring tribes. On the eve of a perilous enterprise, he sought to fortify his mind with a fresh assurance of a divine call to the responsible office. The miracle of the fleece was a very remarkable one&#8212;especially, considering the copious dews that fall in his country. The divine patience and condescension were wonderfully manifested in reversing the form of the miracle. Gideon himself seems to have been conscious of incurring the displeasure of God by his hesitancy and doubts; but He bears with the infirmities of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Gideon said</span> this in way of humble supplication, partly for the strengthening of his own faith, and partly for the greater encouragement of his soldiers in this great and strange attempt. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Gideon said unto God,.... Not to a prophet of God who was there, of whom he asked the following signs to be done, as Ben Gersom, but to God in prayer, as Abarbinel: <p>if thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said; not that he doubted of it, but was willing to have a confirmation of his faith; and perhaps his view was more for the encouragement of those that were with him than himself, that he desired the following signs; and though he had had one before, that was to show that he was truly an angel that spoke to him, and not to ascertain the salvation that should be wrought by him; though that might be concluded from his being an angel that spoke to him, and assured him of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gideon said unto God, <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,</span><p>(p) This request proceeds not from infidelity, but that he might be confirmed in his calling.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">36</span>. <span class="ital">as thou hast spoken</span>] The words are meant to refer to <span class="ital"><a href="/context/judges/6-14.htm" title="And the LORD looked on him, and said, Go in this your might, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent you?...">Jdg 6:14-16</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">36–40</span>. The divine impulse has seized Gideon, he has called out his men, he is ready to attack; but here he seems to be still at home, hesitating and waiting to be convinced. In order of time these verses are parallel, not subsequent, to <a href="/context/judges/6-11.htm" title="And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites....">Jdg 6:11-24</a>; and indeed, after the revelation of the Angel, it is strange that Gideon should have demanded a second sign. Instead of ‘Jehovah’ and ‘the Angel of Jehovah’ the name ‘Elohim’ (God) is used here; the narrative from which these verses come was a work of the Elohist school; to the same narrative we may assign <span class="ital"><a href="/context/judges/6-7.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,...">Jdg 6:7-10</a>; <a href="/context/judges/6-25.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:...">Jdg 6:25-33</a>; <a href="/judges/6-35.htm" title="And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.">Jdg 6:35</a> a</span> (?) in this ch.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt save</span>, etc. There is something touching in Gideon's diffidence of himself, even now that he found himself at the head of a large force. The thought that he was "the least in his father's house" seems still to possess him, and he can hardly believe it possible that he is to save Israel. In his humility he craves a sign that he is indeed chosen and called. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when they demanded of Joash, "Bring out (give out) thy son, that he may die," he said to all who stood round, "Will ye, ye, fight for Baal, or will he save him? ('ye' is repeated with special emphasis). "whoever shall fight for him (Baal), shall be put to death till the morning." &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;, till the (next) morning, is not to be joined to &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514;, in the sense of "very speedily, before the dawning day shall break" (Bertheau), - a sense which is not to be found in the words: it rather belongs to the subject of the clause, or to the whole clause in the sense of, Whoever shall fight for Baal, and seek to avenge the destruction of his altar by putting the author of it to death, shall be put to death himself; let us wait till to-morrow, and give Baal time to avenge the insult which he has received. "If he be God, let him fight for himself; for they have destroyed his altar," and have thereby challenged his revenge. Gideon's daring act of faith had inspired his father Joash with believing courage, so that he took the part of his son, and left the whole matter to the deity to decide. If Baal were really God, he might be expected to avenge the crime that had been committed against this altar.</body></html>
