Gideon does not seem yet to have had any idea that the person that spoke to him was an angel or heavenly being; but appears to have taken him only for some respectable person, or at most a prophet, for the expression, <span class="ital">my Lord, </span>with which he addresses him, was no more than was generally used toward persons of respectability.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-24 Gideon was a man of a brave, active spirit, yet in obscurity through the times: he is here stirred up to undertake something great. It was very sure that the Lord was with him, when his Angel was with him. Gideon was weak in faith, which made it hard to reconcile the assurances of the presence of God with the distress to which Israel was brought. The Angel answered his objections. He told him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer, there needed no more. Bishop Hall says, While God calls Gideon valiant, he makes him so. God delights to advance the humble. Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed. Now, under the influences of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs before our eyes such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God, that if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign in our heart, by the powerful working of his Spirit there, The Angel turned the meat into an offering made by fire; showing that he was not a man who needed meat, but the Son of God, who was to be served and honoured by sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a sacrifice. Hereby a sign was given to Gideon, that he had found grace in God's sight. Ever since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse, a message from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to expect good tidings thence. In this world, it is very awful to have any converse with that world of spirits to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him. But God spoke peace to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The extreme bitterness of the national sufferings under the Midianite occupation breaks out in Gideon's language. The Angel's words, suitable to times of prosperity, seemed to be a mockery, when it was evident the Lord was not with them.

But how reassuring the angel's words were. Which our fathers told us cf. This is a distinct reference to the national traditions, which are elsewhere alluded to (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26, 27</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3-5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-14.htm">Jeremiah 16:14</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But before helping them, the Lord sent a prophet to reprove the people for not hearkening to the voice of their God, in order that they might reflect, and might recognise in the oppression which crushed them the chastisement of God for their apostasy, and so be brought to sincere repentance and conversion by their remembrance of the former miraculous displays of the grace of God. The Lord God, said the prophet to the people, brought you out of Egypt, the house of bondage, and delivered you out of the hand of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/18-9.htm">Exodus 18:9</a>), and out of the hand of all your oppressors (see <a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>; <a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>; <a href="/judges/10-12.htm">Judges 10:12</a>), whom He drove before you (the reference is to the Amorites and Canaanites who were conquered by Moses and Joshua); but ye have not followed His commandment, that ye should not worship the gods of the Amorites.
