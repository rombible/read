Gideon and his men were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made to know that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divine grace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause we sinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew of heavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all the inhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in different measures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation, one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dry ground.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A fresh invasion, and the last, of Midianites Amalekites, and Arabs (see <a href="/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a>).

The southern part of the Ghor lies in a very low level, so that there is a steep and difficult descent into Canaan by the southern wadies.

The great plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon (which is the Greek form of the name), through which the Kishon flows, is eight hours in length from east to west, and five hours (twelve miles) in breadth from north to south. It is described as "a very extensive and fertile plain shut in between the mountain ranges of Samaria and Mount Carmel on the south, and of Galilee on the north," and extending from the Mediterranean at the Gulf of <span class="accented">Caipha</span>, or <span class="accented">Haipha</span>, to the valley of the Jordan. The access to it from the fords of Jordan in the neighbourhood of Bethshan (or <span class="accented">Beishan</span>, called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Scythopolis</span>) made it the natural place for invasion by the wild tribes east of Jordan, as it is to this day. Particular parts of this great plain are called "the valley, of Megiddo" and "the plain of Samaria." For a full account of the plain of Esdraelon see Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' ch. 9. <span class="cmt_word">Went over</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> crossed the Jordan. It appears from vers. 3-5 that these invasions were repeated at certain seasons. When they had plundered all they could get, and eaten up all the produce of the land, they would go back for a while to their own country east of Jordan, and then return again. So they did now, but they met with a different reception this time. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Gideon executed this command of God with ten men of his servants during the night, no doubt the following night, because he was afraid to do it by day, on account of his family (his father's house), and the people of the town.</body></html>
