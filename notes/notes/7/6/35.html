This time Asher did not linger on the sands of Accho or the rocks of the Tyrian Ladder. Issachar, however, as before, “bowed his shoulder to the yoke.” Perhaps the fact that the Plain of Jezreel, the battle-field of Palestine, was in the domains of this tribe, though not far from the border of Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/17-16.htm" title="And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.">Joshua 17:16</a>), was unfavourable to their independence and strength.

Gideon and his men were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made to know that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divine grace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause we sinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew of heavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all the inhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in different measures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation, one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dry ground.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His own tribe, Manasseh, and the three northern tribes of Asher, Zebulon, and Naphtali hastened to join him. Issachar was probably unable to do so, because the Midianites were encamped in the heart of their country. Asher no longer "abode in his breaches," as in the time of Jabin <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17</a>, perhaps ashamed of their former backwardness, and stung by the rebuke of Deborah; perhaps, too, from feeling the Midianite yoke much more galling than that of Jabin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon&#8212;Called in this sudden emergency into the public service of his country, he was supernaturally endowed with wisdom and energy commensurate with the magnitude of the danger and the difficulties of his position. His summons to war was enthusiastically obeyed by all the neighboring tribes. On the eve of a perilous enterprise, he sought to fortify his mind with a fresh assurance of a divine call to the responsible office. The miracle of the fleece was a very remarkable one&#8212;especially, considering the copious dews that fall in his country. The divine patience and condescension were wonderfully manifested in reversing the form of the miracle. Gideon himself seems to have been conscious of incurring the displeasure of God by his hesitancy and doubts; but He bears with the infirmities of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Throughout all Manasseh, </span> on both sides of Jordan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali</span>; because these tribes were nearest to him, and so could soonest join with him; and were nearest the enemy also, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/6-33.htm" title="Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.">Judges 6:33</a></span>, and therefore were most sensible of the calamity, and would in all reason be most forward to rescue themselves from it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sent messengers through all Manasseh,....

Some think this refers both to the half tribe of Manasseh within Jordan, and the other half tribe on the other side Jordan; but that is not very probable, only the half tribe within it is meant: <p>who also was gathered after him; obeying the summons and invitation he gave them by the messengers: <p>and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; which three tribes lay nearest to him on the north; but he sent not to the inhabitants of the tribe of Ephraim, which lay to the south, and which afterwards occasioned a quarrel, <a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>. <p>and they came up to meet them; that is, the inhabitants of the above three tribes, at least many of them, came up from the places of their habitations to meet Gideon, and those that were associated with him, at their place of rendezvous. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35</span>.

"They asked and sought," sc., for the person who had done it; "and they said," either those who were making the inquiry, according to a tolerably safe conjecture, or the persons who were asked, and who were aware of what Gideon had done.</body></html>
