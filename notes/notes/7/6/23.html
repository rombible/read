It was very sure that the Lord was with him, when his Angel was with him. Gideon was weak in faith, which made it hard to reconcile the assurances of the presence of God with the distress to which Israel was brought. The Angel answered his objections. He told him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer, there needed no more. Bishop Hall says, While God calls Gideon valiant, he makes him so. God delights to advance the humble. Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed. Now, under the influences of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs before our eyes such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God, that if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign in our heart, by the powerful working of his Spirit there, The Angel turned the meat into an offering made by fire; showing that he was not a man who needed meat, but the Son of God, who was to be served and honoured by sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a sacrifice. Hereby a sign was given to Gideon, that he had found grace in God's sight. Ever since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse, a message from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to expect good tidings thence. In this world, it is very awful to have any converse with that world of spirits to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him.

Gideon went in, and made ready a kid; &#8230; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot&#8212;(See on [219]Ge 18:7). The flesh seems to have been roasted, which is done by cutting it into kobab, that is, into small pieces, fixed on a skewer, and put before the fire. The broth was for immediate use; the other, brought in a hand-basket was intended to be a future supply to the traveller. The miraculous fire that consumed it and the vanishing of the stranger, not by walking, but as a spirit in the fire, filled Gideon with awe. A consciousness of demerit fills the heart of every fallen man at the thought of God, with fear of His wrath; and this feeling was increased by a belief prevalent in ancient times, that whoever saw an angel would forthwith die. The acceptance of Gideon's sacrifice betokened the acceptance of his person; but it required an express assurance of the divine blessing, given in some unknown manner, to restore his comfort and peace of mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The Lord spake by inward suggestion, rather than in a visible apparition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Peace be unto thee; </span> thou shalt receive no hurt by this vision, as thou fearest; but only <span class="ital">peace</span>, i. e. all the blessings needful for thy own happiness, and for the present work; for this is a very comprehensive phrase among the Hebrews. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto him,....

"Do a sign that thou art speaking with me," i.e., that thou art really God, as thou affirmest. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, or &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, is taken from the language of ordinary life. At the same time he presents this request: "Depart not hence till I((go and) come to thee, and bring out my offering and set it before thee;" and the angel at once assents. Minchah does not mean a sacrifice in the strict sense (&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, sacrificium), nor merely a "gift of food," but a sacrificial gift in the sense of a gift presented to God, on the acceptance of which he hoped to receive the sign, which would show whether the person who had appeared to him was really God. This sacrificial gift consisted of such food as they were accustomed to set before a guest whom they wished especially to honour. Gideon prepared a kid of the goats (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is used to denote the preparation of food, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7-8</a>, etc.), and unleavened cakes of an ephah (about 221/2 lbs.) of meal, and brought the flesh in a basket and the broth in a pot out to the terebinth tree, and placed it before him.</body></html>
