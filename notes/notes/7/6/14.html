It was very sure that the Lord was with him, when his Angel was with him. Gideon was weak in faith, which made it hard to reconcile the assurances of the presence of God with the distress to which Israel was brought. The Angel answered his objections. He told him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer, there needed no more. Bishop Hall says, While God calls Gideon valiant, he makes him so. God delights to advance the humble. Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed. Now, under the influences of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs before our eyes such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray to God, that if we have found grace in his sight, he would show us a sign in our heart, by the powerful working of his Spirit there, The Angel turned the meat into an offering made by fire; showing that he was not a man who needed meat, but the Son of God, who was to be served and honoured by sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a sacrifice. Hereby a sign was given to Gideon, that he had found grace in God's sight. Ever since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse, a message from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to expect good tidings thence. In this world, it is very awful to have any converse with that world of spirits to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him. But God spoke peace to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord looked upon him - That gracious look conferred immediate strength (compare <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>; <a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>; <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>) The change of phrase from "the angel of the Lord" to "the Lord" is remarkable. When messages are delivered by the Angel of the Lord, the form of the message is as if God Himself were speaking (compare <a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>).<p>The sending implied a valid commission and sufficient powers.

And even though assured that, with the divine aid, he would overcome the Midianites as easily as if they were but one man, he still hesitates and wishes to be better assured that the mission was really from God. He resembles Moses also in the desire for a sign; and in both cases it was the rarity of revelations in such periods of general corruption that made them so desirous of having the fullest conviction of being addressed by a heavenly messenger.

The Lord God, said the prophet to the people, brought you out of Egypt, the house of bondage, and delivered you out of the hand of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/18-9.htm">Exodus 18:9</a>), and out of the hand of all your oppressors (see <a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>; <a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>; <a href="/judges/10-12.htm">Judges 10:12</a>), whom He drove before you (the reference is to the Amorites and Canaanites who were conquered by Moses and Joshua); but ye have not followed His commandment, that ye should not worship the gods of the Amorites.
