Besides the simple narrative, which tells us of these results as a sign granted to Gideon in accordance with his prayer, it is of course possible to allegorise the dew as the sign of God’s grace, and to say that the first sign represented Israel as replenished with God’s love when all was dry around (<a href="/hosea/14-5.htm" title="I will be as the dew to Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.">Hosea 14:5</a>, “I will be as the dew unto Israel;” <a href="/micah/5-7.htm" title="And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the middle of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers on the grass, that tarries not for man, nor waits for the sons of men.">Micah 5:7</a>, “Jacob shall be as the dew”); and the second, the fact that “God manifested himself in the weakness and forsaken condition of His people, while the nations were flourishing all around.” Similarly St. Ambrose (<span class= "ital">De Sp. Sanct, </span>Prol. in 1) sees in the fleece full of dew the Hebrew nation hiding the mystery of Christ within itself, and in the dry fleece that mystery extended to all the world, but leaving the Hebrew nation dry. It would be equally possible to give a mystic significance to the threshing-floor, as a type of the universal Church (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>, &c.). But these allegoric applications of simple narratives are, to say the least, precarious; nor is there much value in Ewald’s comparison of the fleece to Gideon’s character, cool amid the general passion, dry amid the general damp of fear.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/6-40.htm" title="And God did so that night: for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.">Jdg 6:40</a></span>. <span class="ital">And God did so — </span>See how tender God is even of the weak; and how ready to condescend to their infirmities! These signs were very expressive. They are going to engage the Midianites. Could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel and the vast floor of Midian? Yes, by this token it appears that he can. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of divine grace might descend on himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew, to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold all the ground is wet! <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:33-40 These signs are truly miraculous, and very significant. Gideon and his men were going to fight the Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel, and the vast floor of Midian? Gideon is made to know that God could do so. Is Gideon desirous that the dew of Divine grace might come down upon himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, all the ground is wet. What cause we sinners of the Gentiles have, to bless the Lord that the dew of heavenly blessings, once confined to Israel, is now sent to all the inhabitants of the earth! Yet still the means of grace are in different measures, according to the purposes of God. In the same congregation, one man's soul is like Gideon's moistened fleece, another like the dry ground.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The threshing floors were and still are under the open air, and usually circular. The second sign <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-40.htm">Judges 6:40</a>, would be more convincing than the former, because it is the nature of fleeces to attract and retain moisture. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon&#8212;Called in this sudden emergency into the public service of his country, he was supernaturally endowed with wisdom and energy commensurate with the magnitude of the danger and the difficulties of his position. His summons to war was enthusiastically obeyed by all the neighboring tribes. On the eve of a perilous enterprise, he sought to fortify his mind with a fresh assurance of a divine call to the responsible office. The miracle of the fleece was a very remarkable one&#8212;especially, considering the copious dews that fall in his country. The divine patience and condescension were wonderfully manifested in reversing the form of the miracle. Gideon himself seems to have been conscious of incurring the displeasure of God by his hesitancy and doubts; but He bears with the infirmities of His people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And God did so that night,.... The night following, the night being the season in which the dew falls: <p>for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground; and this might signify, that not Gideon only, as before, should partake of the divine favour, but all the Israelites, who would share in the salvation wrought by him. Many interpreters observe, that all this is an emblem of the different case and state of the Jews and Gentiles under the different dispensations; that whereas under the former dispensation the Jews partook of the divine favour only, and of the blessings of grace, and enjoyed the words and ordinances with which they were watered, when the Gentiles all around them were like a barren wilderness; so, under the Gospel dispensation, the Gentiles share the above benefits to a greater degree, while the Jews are entirely destitute of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And God did so that night: for it was <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</span><p>(q) By which he was assured that it was a miracle of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Equipment of Gideon for the Battle. - When the Midianites and their allies once more invaded the land of Israel, Gideon was seized by the Spirit of God, so that he gathered together an army from the northern tribes of Israel (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33-35</a>), and entreated God to assure him by a sign of gaining the victory over the enemy (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>).<p><a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33-35</a><p>The enemy gathered together again, went over (viz., across) the Jordan in the neighbourhood of Beisan (see at <a href="/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24</a> and <a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>), and encamped in the valley of Jezreel (see at <a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>). "And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon" (&#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, clothed, i.e., descended upon him, and laid itself around him as it were like a coat of mail, or a strong equipment, so that he became invulnerable and invincible in its might: see <a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>, and <a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>). Gideon then blew the trumpet, to call Israel to battle against the foe (see <a href="/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>); "and Abiezer let itself be summoned after him." His own family, which had recognised the deliverer of Israel in the fighter of Baal, who was safe from Baal's revenge, was the first to gather round him. Their example was followed by all Manasseh, i.e., the Manassites on the west of the Jordan (for the tribes on the east of the Jordan took no part in the war), and the neighbouring tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali on the north, which had been summoned by heralds to the battle. "They advanced to meet them:" i.e., to meet the Manassites, who were coming from the south to the battle, to make war upon the enemy in concert with them and under the guidance of Gideon. &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used to denote their advance against the enemy (see at <a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>), and not in the sense of going up, since the Asherites and Naphtalites would not go up from their mountains into the plain of Jezreel, but could only go down.</body></html>
