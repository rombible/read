The Israelites, for Their Sins, Oppressed by Midian.<p>1. and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian&#8212;Untaught by their former experiences, the Israelites again apostatized, and new sins were followed by fresh judgments. Midian had sustained a severe blow in the time of Moses (Nu 31:1-18); and the memory of that disaster, no doubt, inflamed their resentment against the Israelites. They were wandering herdsmen, called "children of the East," from their occupying the territory east of the Red Sea, contiguous to Moab. The destructive ravages they are described as at this time committing in the land of Israel are similar to those of the Bedouin Arabs, who harass the peaceful cultivators of the soil. Unless composition is made with them, they return annually at a certain season, when they carry off the grain, seize the cattle and other property; and even life itself is in jeopardy from the attacks of those prowling marauders.

These various statements do not enable us to fix any exact boundaries; probably the Midianites shifted their territory in the course of ages. They ranged over the desert E. and S. of Palestine, engaged chiefly in warfare and in escorting trade-caravans (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm" title="Then there passed by Midianites merchants; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.">Genesis 37:28</a>, <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>). The tendency of Arab tribes was to move northwards; accordingly we find the Midianites advancing up the desert E. of the caravan-route, and making forays from time to time into Edom1[35], Moab, and Gilead; on this occasion they even enter Palestine, probably by the valleys Wadi Jâlûd or W. Fara‘, which lead up from the Jordan into the central district. They were tempted by the harvests, and their incursions, here described as taking place repeatedly, caused wide-spread misery. The Bedouin of the desert always looked upon the agricultural population as lawful prey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] Ewald made the attractive suggestion that the battle alluded to in <a href="/genesis/36-35.htm" title="And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.">Genesis 36:35</a> may have been a secondary result of Gideon’s victory described here. <span class="ital">Hist.

An abiding national feud was the natural consequence; and this, added to their love of plunder, no doubt led to the present invasion in company with the Amalekites (<a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>, note).

For the purpose of depicting the boldness and greatness of the deed, the words are crowded together in the second hemistich: &#1492;&#1500;&#1501;, to hammer, or smite with the hammer; &#1502;&#1495;&#1511;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., to smite in pieces, smite through; &#1502;&#1495;&#1509;, to smite or dash in pieces; &#1495;&#1500;&#1507;, to pierce or bore through. The heaping up of the words in <a href="/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a> answers the same purpose. They do not "express the delight of a satisfied thirst for revenge," but simply bring out the thought that Sisera, who was for years the terror of Israel, was now struck dead with a single blow. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, at the place where he bowed, there he fell &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, overpowered and destroyed. In conclusion, the singer refers once more in the last strophe (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28-30</a>) to the mother of Sisera, as she waited impatiently for the return of her son, and foreboded his death, whilst the prudent princesses who surrounded her sought to cheer her with the prospect of a rich arrival of booty. </body></html>
