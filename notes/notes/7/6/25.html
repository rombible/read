It is useless, and therefore undesirable, to speculate as to the exact manner in which the Divine intimation came to him. When God speaks it is not possible for man to mistake His voice. It was distinctly revealed to Gideon that he must be an iconoclast before he could be a deliverer.<p><span class= "bld">Even the second bullock.</span>—It has been disputed whether the true rendering is “<span class= "ital">even” </span>or “and.” Ewald makes it mean “even,” and explains <span class= "ital">shani </span>(second) to mean “old” (<span class= "ital">Gesch. </span>ii.498). The LXX., the Vulgate, Luther, &c, render it “<span class= "ital">and,” </span>as in the margin of our version. This seems to be the right rendering; for (1) the labour of two bullocks would not be too much for the task before Gideon; (2) a bullock (<span class= "ital">shor</span>) of seven yeàrs old would hardly be called a <span class= "ital">young </span>bullock: literally, “a heifer (<span class= "ital">par</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>son of an ox.”<p><span class= "bld">Of seven years old.</span>—The Chaldee renders it, “which has been fattened for seven years,” and there is very possibly an allusion to the seven years of the Midianite oppression (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.">Judges 6:1</a>). The law had not prescribed any fixed age for burnt offerings. Why the bullock is called <span class= "ital">“</span>the second bullock” is very uncertain, but this minute and unexplained detail shows that we are not moving in the region of legend. The first bullock is said to belong to Joash, and we must, therefore, probably suppose that the second was Gideon’s own. Possibly in this circumstance we may see an explanation of these minute directions, and the significance which they were intended to bear. The first bullock had been intended by Joash as a sacrifice to Baal, and <span class= "ital">is </span>used in the destruction of his altar; the <span class= "ital">second </span>had, perhaps, been reserved by Gideon as a sacrifice to the Lord when better times should come—a votive offering, which was being fattened for the longed-for day of deliverance. This bullock is sacrificed to Jehovah, and the fact that it, too, has been used for the destruction of the Canaanite idols is a sign to Gideon that the day for which he had hoped has come.<p><span class= "bld">Throw down.</span>—As commanded in <a href="/exodus/32-13.htm" title="Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.">Exodus 32:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The altar of Baal.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">of the Baal, i.e., </span>of that particular Phœnician idol which your father worships.

The words are literally, <span class= "ital">which is to thy father, </span>as in the previous clause; and the pointed repetition of these words tends to confirm the conjecture mentioned in the previous note. It is called especially Joash’s altar because, though used by the whole city (<a href="/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>), he was the head of the Abi-ezrites.<p><span class= "bld">The grove.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">the Asherah, </span>as in <a href="/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>. Baal, <span class= "ital">“</span>the sun,” and the nature goddess Asherah—who is often confused with Astarte—were worshipped in conjunction (<a href="/context/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31-32</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-6.htm" title="Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)">2Kings 13:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-16.htm" title="At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.">2Kings 18:16</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/24-3.htm" title="Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;">2Kings 24:3-6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That is by it.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">that is upon it. </span>No mention is made of the image of Baal. Possibly the sun was worshipped at this altar without any idol, and the Asherah—perhaps a mere wooden pillar or gross emblem of phallic nature-worship—was placed upon it. It was the first law of God’s worship that He was <span class= "ital">one </span>God and therefore “jealous” against that easy combination of idolatries which is common to all forms of Polytheism. “Baal’s altar must be overthrown before God’s altar is built.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/6-25.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:">Jdg 6:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">The same night the Lord said unto him — </span>Most likely in a dream; <span class="ital">Take the second bullock — </span>Houbigant and some others suspect that there is a deficiency in the text here, as nothing is said of the first bullock. Perhaps he was to offer both bullocks, one for himself, and the other for the sins of the people whom he was to deliver. For, till sin was pardoned through sacrifice offered for it, no good was to be expected. Dr. Dodd, however, conjectures that there is a false reading in the Hebrew, and that <span class="greekheb">פר השׁור</span>, <span class="ital">par-hasshor, </span>which is the expression in the first clause, and is rendered, <span class="ital">young bullock, </span>has, by the mistake of transcribers, been written, <span class="greekheb">פר השׁני</span>, <span class="ital">par hassheni, second bullock, </span>in the next clause. He therefore proposes to render the passage, <span class="ital">Take thy father’s young bullock, even the young bullock of seven years old; </span>the Hebrew phrase, <span class="greekheb">פר השׁור</span>, <span class="ital">par- hasshor, </span>implying no more than the offspring of a bull. Perhaps what some commentators have observed is more fanciful than just, namely, “that as this bullock was calved when the oppression of the Midianites began, so it was now ordered to be sacrificed in token that the oppression should end with this bullock’s death.” <span class="ital">Throw down the altar of Baal — </span>Thus God commands Gideon to begin his heaven-appointed task with the destruction of the altar of Baal, the fatal source of Israel’s defection and punishment; and to expiate their crime by a sacrifice, in the place where they had rendered divine honours to that despicable deity of the Midianites. <span class="ital">That thy father hath </span>made — Which was in his ground, and perhaps erected at his expense, though it was for public use, as appears from <a href="/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Jdg 6:28</a>.

This, Mr. Seldon conjectures, with great probability, was the image of Ashtaroth, or Astarte, for she was worshipped together with Baal. There could be no hope of deliverance till religion was reformed, with which God therefore orders Gideon to begin. This action of Gideon might seem injurious to his father’s authority; but God’s command was a sufficient warrant, and Gideon was now called to be the supreme magistrate, whereby he was made his father’s superior, and was authorized to root out all idolatry, and the instruments thereof.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:25-32 See the power of God's grace, that he could raise up a reformer; and the kindness of his grace, that he would raise up a deliverer, out of the family of a leader in idolatry. Gideon must not think it enough not to worship at that altar; he must throw it down, and offer sacrifice on another. It was needful he should make peace with God, before he made war on Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great Sacrifice, no good is to be expected. God, who has all hearts in his hands, influenced Joash to appear for his son against the advocates for Baal, though he had joined formerly in the worship of Baal. Let us do our duty, and trust God with our safety.

A violent commotion was excited next day, and vengeance vowed against Gideon as the perpetrator. "Joash, his father, quieted the mob in a manner similar to that of the town clerk of Ephesus. It was not for them to take the matter into their own hands.

And this he singled out because of its age; for being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">seven years old, </span> it began with the Midianitish calamity, and being now to be sacrificed, did fitly signify, that the period of that misery was now come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That thy father hath; </span> which thy father built in his own ground, though for the common use of the whole city, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built....">Judges 6:28-30</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The grove that is by it; </span> planted by the altar for idolatrous or impure uses, as the manner of idolaters was.

The night which followed the day in which the angel appeared to Gideon as he was threshing: <p>that the Lord said unto him; perhaps in a dream, since it was in the night: take thy father's young bullock: or "the bullock, the ox" (p); a bullock which was a large grown ox, and was not only his father's property, but what his father designed and set apart for the service of Baal; and though it was his father's, yet having a divine warrant for it, it was sufficient for him to take it without his leave, and especially as it was designed for such an ill use: <p>even the second bullock of seven years old; which, according to Hesiod (q) is in its prime and full strength at nine years old, and lives much longer. In Homer (r), one of five years old is said to be sacrificed: this further describes what he was to take, the second that stood in the stall of the bullocks, or that drew in the second row at plough, or the second in age and value, or the second that was set apart for the service of Baal; though the words may be rendered, "and the second bullock" (s); besides that of his father's, he was to take another, which perhaps belonged to the people, and was the second in birth or age with respect to the former, being seven years old; or, as the Targum is, that had been fatted seven years, and had been so long preparing for the sacrifice of Baal; which was as long as the tyranny of the Midianites over them, and was occasioned by the idolatry of the people of Israel; and such a bullock was ordered to be taken with respect to that, and to show that it would end with the sacrifice of this creature: <p>and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath; upon his ground, in some part of his possessions, and perhaps built at his own expense, though for public use: <p>and cut down the grove that is by it; or "about it", as the Vulgate Latin version; it being usual with the Heathens to plant groves near or around their altars and temples where religious worship was performed; partly to make them more pleasant and venerable, and partly for the commission of deeds which would not bear the light; or "over it", for they were commonly tall trees which grew over the altar they erected. Some render it, "upon it" (t), and understand by it an idol placed on it: so the Arabic version is,"cut down the female idol Asira (perhaps the same with Astarte), which is upon the same altar;''and so the Syriac version to the same purpose, which calls it the idol Estere, set upon the altar. <p>(p)  "juvencum bovem", Drusius; "juvencum adultiorem", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

The LXX, cod. A and Luc, reads ‘the fatted calf’ instead of ‘the steer of the ox’; but no satisfactory emendation has been proposed.

But it is a simple explanation that the two bullocks were used in the laborious work of demolishing the altar of Baal, and removing the earth and the stone to build the altar of the Lord, and that when the work was finished one of the bullocks - the seven-year-old - was sacrificed. <span class="cmt_word">For the grove</span> see <a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>, note. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Gideon could no longer have any doubt after this promise that the person who had appeared to him was speaking in the name of God, he entreated him to assure him by a sign (&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, a miraculous sign) of the certainty of his appearance. "Do a sign that thou art speaking with me," i.e., that thou art really God, as thou affirmest. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, or &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, is taken from the language of ordinary life. At the same time he presents this request: "Depart not hence till I((go and) come to thee, and bring out my offering and set it before thee;" and the angel at once assents. Minchah does not mean a sacrifice in the strict sense (&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, sacrificium), nor merely a "gift of food," but a sacrificial gift in the sense of a gift presented to God, on the acceptance of which he hoped to receive the sign, which would show whether the person who had appeared to him was really God. This sacrificial gift consisted of such food as they were accustomed to set before a guest whom they wished especially to honour. Gideon prepared a kid of the goats (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is used to denote the preparation of food, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7-8</a>, etc.), and unleavened cakes of an ephah (about 221/2 lbs.) of meal, and brought the flesh in a basket and the broth in a pot out to the terebinth tree, and placed it before him.</body></html>
