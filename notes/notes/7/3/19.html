He wished (1) to secure his end, which would be more difficult amid the soldiers and attendants who would guard the king during the presentation of the tribute; (2) to avoid endangering his comrades; (3) to provide, if possible, for his own escape. By going away with the deputation of serfs<p>which he had introduced, he would still more lull suspicion asleep.<p><span class= "bld">From the quarries.</span>—The Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">pesilîm. </span>The LXX., followed by our margin, render it “graven images;” and the Vulgate, “from Gilgal, where were idols.” (Luther, <span class= "ital">Götzen.</span>) Such is the meaning of <span class= "ital">pesîlîm </span>in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-41.htm" title="So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.">2Kings 17:41</a>; <a href="/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a>, &c. The rendering, <span class= "ital">“</span>stone quarries,” is derived from the Chaldee and Rabbi Jarchi; but it probably means idols of some kind—probably those of Moab. Some explain it of the twelve stones which were taken out of Jordan, and pitched at Gilgal (<a href="/joshua/4-2.htm" title="Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,">Joshua 4:2</a>). The LXX. (in some MSS.) make it mean that <span class= "ital">Eglon </span>returned, but this is clearly a mistake. Gilgal was near Jericho, and when Ehud had accompanied his comrades to some well-known landmark at Gilgal, he returned to Jericho. Josephus says he had “two attendants” with him; but the word “people” in <a href="/judges/3-18.htm" title="And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.">Judges 3:18</a> implies that many more had accompanied him.<p><span class= "bld">By Gilgal.</span>—Ewald thinks that Gilgal belonged to Ephraim, and that “he went to see if all was safe at this frontier-post.” If the <span class= "ital">pesîlîm </span>were sacred stones to mark a boundary (cp. <a href="/judges/5-26.htm" title="She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.">Judges 5:26</a>), they would, like the Greek Hermæ, have been condemned by the Jews as idolatrous.<p><span class= "bld">I have a secret errand unto thee, O king.</span>—Something in Ehud’s position and antecedents enabled him to reckon on the king’s credulity. Eglon, aware of discontent among the Israelites, may have supposed that Ehud had some secret to betray. Similarly Darius obtained an interview with the Pseudo-Smerdis, for the purpose of assassinating him, by pretending to have a secret message to him; and, in explaining it to his comrade, says, “When lying is necessary, lie” (Herod, iii. 72). In Josephus’s version of the story, Ehud pretends that he has a <span class= "ital">dream </span>to narrate.<p><span class= "bld">Who said, Keep silence.</span>—Rather, “And he said, <span class= "ital">Hush!” </span>(Heb., Hâs.) The narrative is very graphic, but it does not appear whether the “Hush!” was addressed to Ehud, to prevent him from saying any more in the presence of the attendants, or as an intimation to the attendants to retire. They at once understood that the king wished to be left alone.<p><span class= "bld">All that stood by him.</span>—Courtiers always <span class= "ital">stand </span>in the presence of Eastern kings.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-30 When Israel sins again, God raises up a new oppressor. The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gilgal was in the immediate neighborhood of Jericho <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>, where doubtless Eglon held his court at this time <a href="/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>.<p>Quarries - Some take the original of this word in its common meaning of carved images or idols (see the margin). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. quarries&#8212;rather, "graven images" (De 7:25; Jer 8:19; 51:52); statues of Moabite idols, the sight of which kindled the patriotic zeal of Ehud to avenge this public insult to Israel on its author.<p>I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence&#8212;"Privacy"&#8212;a signal for all to withdraw.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He turned again, </span> as if he had forgot and neglected some important business. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the quarries; </span> either, first, Whence they hewed stones.

And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken to the ground.">Isaiah 21:9</a>; <a href="/micah/5-13.htm" title="Your graven images also will I cut off, and your standing images out of the middle of you; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.">Micah 5:13</a> etc.), and in the margin of A. and RV. here, the word (<span class="ital">pesîlîm</span>) is rendered <span class="ital">graven images</span> (cf. <span class="ital">pesel</span> ‘graven image’), and such is the meaning in this place; <span class="bld">idols</span>, or perhaps in a more general sense, <span class="bld">sculptured stones</span> (Moore). They were connected with the sanctuary of <span class="ital">Gilgal</span> (see on <a href="/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a>), which was marked by a <span class="ital">circle</span> of sacred stones, traditionally those which Joshua set up to commemorate the crossing of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-20.htm" title="And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.">Joshua 4:20</a>). The rendering <span class="ital">quarries</span> goes back to the Targum, and is due to the wish to avoid an objectionable reference. <span class="ital">The idols by Gilgal</span> may be mentioned merely as a familiar land-mark on the W. of the Jordan, cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/3-26.htm" title="And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.">Jdg 3:26</a></span>; or rather, perhaps, to account for what follows in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/3-20.htm" title="And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you. And he arose out of his seat.">Jdg 3:20</a></span>. Ehud waited at the sanctuary to find a pretext for returning unexpectedly to speak with the king; he had received an oracle there, ‘a message from God,’ which he must communicate to the king personally (so Lagrange). The position of Gilgal, between Jericho and the Jordan, shews that Eglon’s residence must have been not at Jericho, but on the other side of the river, in Moab.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Keep silence</span>] Cf. <a href="/amos/6-10.htm" title="And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say to him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold your tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.">Amos 6:10</a>. The command is addressed to the courtiers, who are dismissed in order that the king may speak to Ehud in private. Ehud had entered the presence publicly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">20</span> <span class="ital">And Ehud came unto him</span>] i.e. from the public hall to a private room: the king <span class="ital">was sitting in his cool roof-chamber</span>, such as is often built on the flat roof of an Eastern house. Ehud’s words in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/3-19.htm" title="But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.">Jdg 3:19</a></span>, spoken publicly in the king’s presence, contain a request for a private audience; the king thereupon dismisses his attendants, retires to his chamber on the roof, where he receives Ehud in the manner desired. The transition from <span class="ital"><a href="/context/judges/3-19.htm" title="But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him....">Jdg 3:19-20</a></span> is not clearly expressed: we should gather from <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/3-19.htm" title="But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.">Jdg 3:19</a></span> that, after the attendants had left, the interview took place in the public room; but in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/3-20.htm" title="And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to you. And he arose out of his seat.">Jdg 3:20</a></span> Ehud finds the king alone in his <span class="ital">cool chamber</span>. There is no need, however, to regard the two verses as doublets; the narrative is compressed, and the omission of details leaves something to be supplied by the imagination.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a message from God unto thee</span>] i.e. a divine communication. Josephus explains that it had been conveyed by a dream, <span class="ital">Ant.</span> <a href="/judges/3-4.htm" title="And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.">Jdg 3:4</a>; <a href="/judges/3-2.htm" title="Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;">Jdg 3:2</a>. The LXX adds <span class="ital">O king</span>, which may be right. Out of respect for the oracle the king rises from his chair; cf. <a href="/numbers/23-18.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; listen to me, you son of Zippor:">Numbers 23:18</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The quarries</span>.

Eglon allied himself with the Ammonites and Amalekites, those arch-foes of Israel, invaded the land, took the palm-city, i.e., Jericho (see at <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>), and made the Israelites tributary for eighteen years. Sixty years had passed since Jericho had been burnt by Joshua. During that time the Israelites had rebuilt the ruined city, but they had not fortified it, on account of the curse pronounced by Joshua upon any one who should restore it as a fortress; so that the Moabites could easily conquer it, and using it as a base, reduce the Israelites to servitude. </body></html>
