The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon his right thigh - The proper side for a left-handed man.

"The Spirit of Jehovah came upon him." The Spirit of God is the spiritual principle of life in the world of nature and man; and in man it is the principle both of the natural life which we received through birth, and also of the spiritual life which we received through regeneration (vid., Auberlen, Geist des Menschen, in Herzog's Cycl. iv. p. 731). In this sense the expressions "Spirit of God" (Elohim) and "Spirit of the Lord" (Jehovah) are interchanged even in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>, and so throughout all the books of the Old Testament; the former denoting the Divine Spirit generally in its supernatural causality and power, the latter the same Spirit in its operations upon human life and history in the working out of the plan of salvation. In its peculiar operations the Spirit of Jehovah manifests itself as a spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and might, of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>). The communication of this Spirit under the Old Testament was generally made in the form of extraordinary and supernatural influence upon the human spirit. The expression employed to denote this is usually &#1497;&#1497; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; ("the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him:" thus here, <a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-14.htm">2 Chronicles 20:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>). This is varied, however, with the expressions &#1497;&#1497; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (&#1510;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492;) &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>, <a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>; <a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-6.htm">1 Samuel 11:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) and &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508; &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1497;&#1497; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, "the Spirit of Jehovah clothed the man" (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>). Of these the former denotes the operations of the Divine Spirit in overcoming the resistance of the natural will of man, whilst the latter represents the Spirit of God as a power which envelopes or covers a man. The recipients and bearers of this Spirit were thereby endowed with the power to perform miraculous deeds, in which the Spirit of God that came upon them manifested itself generally in the ability to prophesy (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-14.htm">2 Chronicles 20:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>), but also in the power to work miracles or to accomplish deeds which surpassed the courage and strength of the natural man. The latter was more especially the case with the judges; hence the Chaldee paraphrases "the Spirit of Jehovah" in <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a> as the spirit of might from the Lord;" though in the passage before us it gives the erroneous interpretation &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, "the spirit of prophecy." Kimchi also understands it as signifying "the spirit of bravery, under the instigation of which he was able fearlessly to enter upon the war with Chushan." But we are hardly at liberty to split up the different powers of the Spirit of God in this manner, and to restrict its operations upon the judges to the spirit of strength and bravery alone. The judges not only attacked the enemy courageously and with success, but they also judged the nation, for which the spirit of wisdom and understanding was indispensably necessary, and put down idolatry (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>), which they could not have done without the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. "And he judged Israel and went out to war." The position of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; before &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488; does not warrant us in explaining &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; as signifying "he began to discharge the functions of a judge," as Rosenmller has done: for &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; must not be limited to a settlement of the civil disputes of the people, but means to restore right in Israel, whether towards its heathen oppressors, or with regard to the attitude of the nation towards the Lord. "And the Lord gave Chushan-rishathaim into his hand (cf. <a href="/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>, etc.), and his hand became strong over him;" i.e., he overcame him (cf. <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>), or smote him, so that he was obliged to vacate the land. In consequence of this victory, and the land had rest from war (cf. <a href="/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>) forty years. "And then Othniel died:" the expression &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; with &#1493; consec. does not necessarily imply that Othniel did not die for forty years, but simply that he died after rest had been restored to the land. </body></html>
