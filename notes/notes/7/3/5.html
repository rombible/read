The Lord was pleased to try them by the remains of the devoted nations they spared. Temptations and trials detect the wickedness of the hearts of sinners; and strengthen he graces of believers in their daily conflict with Satan, sin, and this evil world. They must live in this world, but they are not of it, and are forbidden to conform to it. This marks the difference between the followers of Christ and mere professors. The friendship of the world is more fatal than its enmity; the latter can only kill the body, but the former murders many precious souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lords - Seranim, a title used exclusively of the princes of the five Philistine cities.

The plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1501;, in the place of the singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, which the foregoing &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; requires, is to be regarded as a constructio ad sensum, i.e., to be attributed to the fact, that keeping the way of God really consists in observing the commandments of God, and that this was the thought which floated before the writer's mind. The thought expressed in this verse, that Jehovah would not exterminate the Canaanites before Israel any more, to try them whether they would keep His commandments, just as He had previously caused the people whom He brought out of Egypt to wander in the wilderness for forty years with the very same intention (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>), is not at variance with the design of God, expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29-30</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>, not to exterminate the Canaanites all at once, lest the land should become waste, and the wild beasts multiply therein, nor yet with the motive assigned in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-2</a>. For the determination not to exterminate the Canaanite sin one single year, was a different thing from the purpose of God to suspend their gradual extermination altogether. The former purpose had immediate regard to the well-being of Israel; the latter, on the contrary, was primarily intended as a chastisement for its transgression of the covenants, although even this chastisement was intended to lead the rebellious nation to repentance, and promote its prosperity by a true conversion to the Lord. And the motive assigned in <a href="/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2</a> is in perfect harmony with this intention, as our explanation of this passage will clearly show. </body></html>
