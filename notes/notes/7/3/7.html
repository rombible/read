And groves and trees themselves were worshipped; so Tacitus says (f) of the Germans, that they consecrated groves and forests, and called them by the names of gods. Groves are here put in the place of Ashtaroth, <a href="/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>; perhaps the goddesses of that name were worshipped in groves; and if Diana is meant by Astarte, Servius (g) says that every oak is sacred to Jupiter and every grove to Diana; and Ovid (h) speaks of a temple of Diana in a grove. But as they are joined with Baalim, the original of which were deified kings and heroes, the groves may be such as were consecrated to them; for, as the same writer observes (i), the souls of heroes were supposed to have their abode in groves; See Gill on <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a> and See Gill on <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>. It was in this time of defection that the idolatry of Micah, and of the Danites, and the war of Benjamin about the Levite's concubine, happened, though related at the end of the book; so Josephus (k) places the account here. <p>(d) "Lucus in urbe fuit media", &amp;c.

It was a characteristic feature of the Canaanite sanctuaries, and from them it was adopted by the Israelites; thus at Ophrah an <span class="ital">ashçrah</span> stood by the altar of Baal (<a href="/judges/6-25.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:">Jdg 6:25</a>), at Samaria, Beth-el, Jerusalem by the altar of Jehovah (<a href="/2_kings/13-6.htm" title="Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)">2 Kings 13:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm" title="And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof on the graves of the children of the people.">2 Kings 23:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2 Kings 23:15</a>; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a> f.). It seems to have been a general symbol for deity. How it came to have this significance is disputed; some regard the sacred pole as a substitute for a tree and a relic of primitive tree-worship; others think that the name meant originally a <span class="ital">sign-post</span>, marking the precincts of the sanctuary, cf. Assyr. <span class="ital">ashirtu</span> ‘sanctuary,’ ‘temple.’ Here, however, and in a few other passages, <span class="ital">ashçrah</span>, like ‘Ashtoreth elsewhere (e.g. <a href="/judges/2-13.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.">Jdg 2:13</a>), is combined with Baal, and was <span class="ital">served</span> apparently as a divinity; cf. <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.">2 Kings 23:4</a> and <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm" title="And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.">1 Kings 15:13</a>, <a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm" title="And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:">2 Kings 21:7</a>. Was <span class="ital">ashçrah</span>, then, a goddess, confused with ‘Ashtoreth and sometimes put in her place1[26]? From outside the O.T. we find undoubted evidence of a goddess Ashçrah, worshipped by the Babylonians in the remote period of Ḫammurabi (c. 2130 b.c.), and of Western or Canaanite origin; while the pr. name <span class="ital">Abd-ashirta</span> ‘servant of Ashçrah,’ which occurs frequently in the Amarna letters, implies her cult in Canaan in the xv cent. b.c.2[27] Still more decisive is the express mention of her name in the phrase ‘the finger of Ashirat,’ from one of the cuneiform tablets found at Taanach (Driver, <span class="ital">Schweich Lects</span>., p. 82). The goddess Ashratum, i.e. ‘the kindly,’ ‘the gracious,’ is simply the fem. of the god Ashur, sometimes written Ashir. In S. Arabia we meet with <span class="ital">Athîrat</span>, the wife of the moon-god; in N. Arabia (Têma) the name was pronounced <span class="ital">Ashîra</span>3[28]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] The confusion goes much further in the Versions, e.g. Vulg. here has Astaroth; but it is in no way due to any similarity in the names, which are quite distinct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[27] The inscr. of Ḫammurabi which mentions <span class="ital">Ash-ra-tum</span>, ‘the bride of the king of heaven,’ is given by Hommel, <span class="ital">Aufsätze u. Abhandlungen</span> ii. 211 f. In the Amarna letters the pr. name alluded to is once written <span class="ital">Ab-di-ash-ta-</span>[<span class="ital">ar</span>]<span class="ital">-ti</span>, i.e. ‘servant of Ishtar,’ shewing how early the confusion between Ashçrah and ‘Ashtoreth began; see also Zimmern, <span class="ital">Keilinschr. u. d. A. T.</span>3 432 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] For <span class="ital">Athîrat</span> in Minaean inscrr. see Hommel l.c. 206 ff., <span class="ital">Expos. Times</span> xi. (1899) 127; for the Aramaic inscr. of Têma see <span class="ital">NSI.</span> 195 ff. In the obscure expression ‘Ashtart in the ashçrah’ the name occurs once in Phoenician, inscr. of Ma‘sûb (<span class="ital">NSI.</span> 50). On some seals and gems, partly of Assyr.-Babyl., partly of Phoen. origin, an altar or a sacred tree is represented with what may be intended for a pole (or <span class="ital">maṣṣçbah</span> ‘pillar’) on either side.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>. The bearing of this evidence upon the usage of the O.T. is not easy to make out; there was a goddess Ashçrah, though in the O.T. the name is probably not to be understood in this sense. At any rate the goddess never had a very distinct existence; in Babylonia she was overshadowed by Ishtar; in Canaan, at a later epoch, she was confused with, or absorbed into, the great Canaanite goddess ‘Ashtoreth, and survived merely in the name of the sacred pole, usually a general symbol for deity, but occasionally, as here, regarded as itself divine and worshipped. In this way, perhaps, we may do justice to all the facts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7–11. <span class="ital">Othniel delivers Israel from Cushan-rishathaim<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span>The account of this deliverance is given as a typical illustration of the theory announced in <a href="/context/judges/2-11.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:...">Jdg 2:11-19</a>. It is composed almost entirely of the standing formulae of the Deuteronomic editor. The other narratives of the Judges are founded upon some popular story, but there is no story here; the only details preserved are the bare names of the oppressor and the deliverer. As it stands this meagre notice can hardly be historical; but when we go behind it we seem to discover the faint tradition of an actual struggle.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The groves</span>.

In the first place (<a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1</a>), &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is more precisely defined as signifying "all those who had not known all the wars of Canaan," sc., from their own observation and experience, that is to say, the generation of the Israelites which rose up after the death of Joshua. For "the wars of Canaan" were the wars which were carried on by Joshua with the almighty help of the Lord for the conquest of Canaan. The whole thought is then still further expanded in <a href="/judges/3-2.htm">Judges 3:2</a> as follows: "only (for no other purpose than) that the succeeding generations (the generations which followed Joshua and his contemporaries) of the children of Israel, that He (Jehovah) might teach them war, only those who had not known them (the wars of Canaan)." The suffix attached to &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; refers to "the wars of Canaan," although this is a feminine noun, the suffix in the masculine plural being frequently used in connection with a feminine noun. At first sight it would appear as though the reason given here for the non-extermination of the Canaanites was not in harmony with the reason assigned in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-22.htm">Judges 2:22</a>, which is repeated in <a href="/judges/3-4.htm">Judges 3:4</a> of the present chapter. But the differences are perfectly reconcilable, if we only give a correct explanation of the two expression, "learning war," and the "wars of Canaan." Learning war in the context before us is equivalent to learning to make war upon the nations of Canaan. Joshua and the Israelites of his time had not overcome these nations by their own human power or by earthly weapons, but by the miraculous help of their God, who had smitten and destroyed the Canaanites before the Israelites. The omnipotent help of the Lord, however, was only granted to Joshua and the whole nation, on condition that they adhered firmly to the law of God (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>), and faithfully observed the covenant of the Lord; whilst the transgression of that covenant, even by Achan, caused the defeat of Israel before the Canaanites (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>). In the wars of Canaan under Joshua, therefore, Israel had experienced and learned, that the power to conquer its foes did not consist in the multitude and bravery of its own fighting men, but solely in the might of its God, which it could only possess so long as it continued faithful to the Lord. This lesson the generations that followed Joshua had forgotten, and consequently they did not understand how to make war. To impress this truth upon them-the great truth, upon which the very existence as well as the prosperity of Israel, and its attainment of the object of its divine calling, depended; in other words, to teach it by experience, that the people of Jehovah could only fight and conquer in the power of its God-the Lord had left the Canaanites in the land. Necessity teaches a man to pray. The distress into which the Israelites were brought by the remaining Canaanites was a chastisement from God, through which the Lord desired to lead back the rebellious to himself, to keep them obedient to His commandments, and to train them to the fulfilment of their covenant duties. In this respect, learning war, i.e., learning how the congregation of the Lord was to fight against the enemies of God and of His kingdom, was one of the means appointed by God to tempt Israel, or prove whether it would listen to the commandments of God (<a href="/judges/3-4.htm">Judges 3:4</a>), or would walk in the ways of the Lord. If Israel should so learn to war, it would learn at the same time to keep the commandments of God. But both of these were necessary for the people of God. For just as the realization of the blessings promised to the nation in the covenant depended upon its hearkening to the voice of the Lord, so the conflicts appointed for it were also necessary, just as much for the purification of the sinful nation, as for the perpetuation and growth of the kingdom of God upon the earth.</body></html>
