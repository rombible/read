The Lord was pleased to try them by the remains of the devoted nations they spared. Temptations and trials detect the wickedness of the hearts of sinners; and strengthen he graces of believers in their daily conflict with Satan, sin, and this evil world. They must live in this world, but they are not of it, and are forbidden to conform to it. This marks the difference between the followers of Christ and mere professors. The friendship of the world is more fatal than its enmity; the latter can only kill the body, but the former murders many precious souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 3:5-7.

The Israelites intermarried with the inhabitants of the land, contrary to the express command of God, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>; whereby they confounded their families, debased their blood, and were ensnared into idolatry, as follows: perhaps to these unlawful marriages, in their first settlement in the land of Canaan, reference is had in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>, "thy father was an Amorite and thy mother an Hittite"; an Amorite marrying a daughter of Israel, and an Israelitish man an Hittite woman: <p>and served their gods; this was the natural consequence of their intermarriages, which the Lord foresaw, and therefore cautioned them against them, <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they took <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</span><p>(c) Contrary to God's commandment, De 7:3.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">they took their daughters</span>] Cf. <a href="/genesis/34-9.htm" title="And make you marriages with us, and give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.">Genesis 34:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/34-16.htm" title="Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.">Genesis 34:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-16.htm" title="And you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make your sons go a whoring after their gods.">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm" title="Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take to your son.">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>. According to the ideas of the ancient world, it was impossible for the Israelites to maintain any religious exclusiveness when they intermarried with the heathen nations (cf. <a href="/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a> b–3); the connubium carried with it an alliance of religion and worship, as for instance in the case of Solomon, <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm" title="But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:">1 Kings 11:1</a> ff.

Intermarriage with the Canaanite nations had been expressly forbidden (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15, 16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a>), and the reason of the prohibition clearly stated, and for some time after Joshua's death no such marriages appear to have been contracted. But now the fatal step was taken, and the predicted consequence immediately ensued: "they served their gods;.., they forgat the Lord their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:7-11 This section introduces us into the actual narrative of the Book of Judges, the prefatory matter being now concluded. The whole book proceeds on the same model as this section does. The apostasy of Israel; their servitude under the oppressor sent to chastise them; their cry of distress and penitence; their deliverance by the judge raised up to save them; the rest which follows their deliverance. There is infinite variety in the details of the successive narratives, but they are all formed on the same plan. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In consequence of this resolution, the Lord let these tribes (those mentioned in <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>) remain at rest, i.e., quietly, in the land, without exterminating them rapidly. The expression &#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, hastily, quickly, i.e., according to the distinct words of the following clause, through and under Joshua, appears strange after what has gone before. For what is threatened in <a href="/judges/2-21.htm">Judges 2:21</a> is not the suspension of rapid extermination, but of any further extermination. This threat, therefore, is so far limited by the word "hastily," as to signify that the Lord would not exterminate any more of these nations so long as Israel persisted in its idolatry. But as soon as and whenever Israel returned to the Lord its God in true repentance, to keep His covenant, the Lord would recall His threat, and let the promised extermination of the Canaanites go forward again. Had Israel not forsaken the Lord its God so soon after Joshua's death, the Lord would have exterminated the Canaanites who were left in the land much sooner than He did, or have carried out their gradual extermination in a much shorter time than was actually the case, in consequence of the continual idolatry of the people. </body></html>
