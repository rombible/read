It occurs repeatedly in ch. 16; <a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5, 6, 29</a>, etc. The word means an <span class="accented">axle-tree. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The entering in of Hamath</span>. There are two theories in regard to Hamath. Some, as Professor Rawlinson in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' identify it with <span class="accented">Hamah</span>, a large and important city on the Orontes in Upper Syria, and consider <span class="accented">that</span> the kingdom of Hamath, which was overthrown by the king of Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>), and of which Hamath was the capital, was for the most part an independent Hamitic or Canaanite kingdom (<a href="/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), but occasionally, as in the days of Solomon and Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), subject to Israel Others, however, justly considering the great improbability of the Israelite dominion having ever extended so far north as the valley of the Orontes, and observing how it is spoken of as an integral part of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>), look for Hamath much further south, in the neighbourhood of Beth-rehob (see <a href="/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>, note). As regards the phrase "the entering in of Hamath," the identical Hebrew words occur seven times, viz., <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; in this passage; <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>, and are variously rendered in the A.V.: "as men come to Hamath;" "unto the entrance of Hamath;" "the entering into Hamath;" "the entering in of Hamath (three times); and the entering of Hamath." The exact meaning of  the phrase seems to be "the approach to  Hamath," some particular spot in the valley  from whence the direct road to Hamath begins; very much like the railway term for  certain stations which are the nearest to,  though at some little distance from, the  place from which they are named, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>,  Shapwick Road, Mildenhall Road, etc. The latter words of the verse describe the territory of the Hivites, which reached from Mount Baal-hermon in the Lebanon range as far as the point where the road leads to Hamath. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Chastisement of the Rebellious Nation. - <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-20.htm">Judges 2:20</a>, <a href="/judges/2-21.htm">Judges 2:21</a>. On account of this idolatry, which was not only constantly repeated, but continued to grow worse and worse, the anger of the Lord burned so fiercely against Israel, that He determined to destroy no more of the nations which Joshua had left when he died, before the people that had broken His covenant. In order to set forth this divine purpose most distinctly, it is thrown into the form of a sentence uttered by God through the expression &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;. The Lord said, "Because this people has transgressed my covenant, ... I also will no longer keep my covenant promise (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>, <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>., <a href="/exodus/34-10.htm">Exodus 34:10</a>.), and will no more drive out any of the remaining Canaanites before them" (see <a href="/joshua/23-13.htm">Joshua 23:13</a>). </body></html>
