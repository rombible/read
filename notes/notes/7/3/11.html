Many questions have been raised, such as—Do the forty years <span class= "ital">include </span>or <span class= "ital">exclude </span>the period of servitude? Is forty meant to be an exact or a general number? Are the various periods of rest and servitude continuous and successive, or do they refer to different parts of the Holy Land, and do they synchronise? Perhaps no final answer to these questions is as yet possible, and no less than fifty schemes of the chronology of the period of the judges have been attempted, which fact alone proves how insufficient are the data on which to decide.<p><span class= "bld">Died.</span>—Probably <span class= "ital">during </span>the forty years, unless we suppose that he attained a most unusual age.

Soon after Israel's settlement in Canaan their purity began to be corrupted, and their peace disturbed. But affliction makes those cry to God who before would scarcely speak to him. God returned in mercy to them for their deliverance. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel. The Spirit of wisdom and courage to qualify him for the service, and the Spirit of power to excite him to it. He first judged Israel, reproved and reformed them, and then went to war. Let sin at home be conquered, that worst of enemies, then enemies abroad will be more easily dealt with. Thus let Christ be our Judge and Lawgiver, then he will save us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The land - means here, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a>, not the whole land of Canaan, but the part concerned, probably the land of the tribe of Judah.

Thus the Israelites are said to <span class="ital">bear their iniquities forty years in the wilderness</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a></span>, when there wanted near two years of that number; and <span class="ital">to dwell in Egypt four hundred and thirty years</span>, when there wanted many years of that number. Thus <span class="ital">Joseph’s kindred</span>, sent for and called by him into Egypt, are numbered seventy-five souls, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/acts/7-14.htm" title="Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, three score and fifteen souls.">Acts 7:14</a></span>, although they were but seventy, as is affirmed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/46-27.htm" title="And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten.">Genesis 46:27</a> <a href="/exodus/1-5.htm" title="And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.">Exodus 1:5</a></span>. So here <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the land</span> is said to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">rest forty years</span>, although they were in servitude eight of those years, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8</a></span>. And in like manner <span class="ital">the land</span> is said to <span class="ital">have rest eighty years</span>, though eighteen of them they served the king of Moab, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/3-14.htm" title="So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.">Judges 3:14</a></span>. And so in some other instances. Nor is it strange and unusual, either in Scripture or in other authors, for things to be denominated from the greater part, as here it was; especially when they did enjoy some degrees of rest and peace, even in their times of slavery, which here they did. Or, secondly, <span class="ital">It rested</span>, i.e. began to rest, or recovered its interrupted rest, <span class="ital">in the fortieth year</span>, either after Joshua’s death, or after the first and famous rest procured for them by Joshua, as is noted, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm" title="There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.">Hebrews 4:9</a></span>, when he destroyed and subdued the Canaanites, and gave them quiet possession of the land; and <span class="ital">the land had rest from war</span>, as is said, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/11-23.htm" title="So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.">Joshua 11:23</a> 14:15</span>. So there is this difference between the years of servitude and oppression, and those of rest, that in the former he tells us how long it lasted; in the latter, when it began; by which, compared with the other years, it was easy also to know how long the rest lasted. To strengthen this interpretation, two things must be noted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That <span class="ital">resting</span> is here put for beginning to rest, as <span class="ital">to beget</span> is put for <span class="ital">beginning to beget</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/5-32.htm" title="And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 5:32</a> 11:26</span>; and <span class="ital">to reign</span>, for <span class="ital">to begin to reign</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years.

That <span class="ital">forty years</span> is put for <span class="ital">the fortieth year</span>; the cardinal number for the ordinal, which is common both in the Holy Scripture, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/1-5.htm" title="And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

As it should seem from the time of this deliverance; though, according to Ben Gersom and Abarbinel, the eight years' servitude are to be included in them; and Bishop Usher (r) reckons these forty years from the rest first settled in the land by Joshua; but the former sense seems best: <p>and Othniel the son of Kenaz died: not at the end of the forty years; it is not likely he should live so long, but when he died is not certain; Eusebius (s) says he judged Israel fifty years. <p>(r) Anual.
