The name Gera was hereditary in the tribe of Benjamin (see <a href="/2_samuel/19-18.htm" title="And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;">2Samuel 19:18</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,">1Chronicles 8:1-7</a>), and the Jews so constantly omit steps in their genealogies that we can never be sure that “son” means more than “descendant.” Ehud seems to be another form of Abihud (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/8-1.htm" title="Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,">1Chronicles 8:1-8</a>). St. Jerome explains it to mean “one who praises “or “is praised.” Josephus calls him a young man, and even “a youth” (<span class= "ital">neaniskos</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">A Benjamite.</span>—“Ben-ha-jemînî,” as in <a href="/psalms/7-1.htm" title="O LORD my God, in you do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:">Psalm 7:1</a>. The word is generally written undivided, so that here the LXX., Vulgate, and Luther have “son of Jemini.” No doubt the Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee rightly understood it to mean a Benjamite, but still there seems to be an intentional play on words, for “Ben-ha-jemînî” may also mean “a <span class= "ital">son of the right hand, </span>who,” as the writer adds, “was <span class= "ital">helpless with his right hand</span>” (<span class= "ital">Ben-ha-jemînî eesh ittêr jad-jemînî</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">Lefthanded—Marg.,</span> “Shut of his right hand.” Luther also renders it “<span class= "ital">links” </span>but the LXX. and the Vulgate take it to mean “ambidextrous,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>able to use his left hand as well as his right (LXX., <span class= "ital">amphoterodexion; </span>Vulg., <span class= "ital">qui utrague manu pro dexterâ utebatur</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Josephus says that he was “best skilled in using his left hand, in which was his whole strength” (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 4, § 2). This rendering is merely an inference, from the fact that in <a href="/context/judges/20-15.htm" title="And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.">Judges 20:15-16</a> (comp. <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.">1Chronicles 12:2</a>) there are <span class= "ital">“</span>700 chosen men left-handed.” (See the Note on that verse.) The Hebrew <span class= "ital">ittêr, </span>however, is correctly rendered “shut” in the margin of our version (comp. <a href="/psalms/69-16.htm" title="Hear me, O LORD; for your loving kindness is good: turn to me according to the multitude of your tender mercies.">Psalm 69:16</a>, “lest the pit <span class= "ital">shut </span>her mouth upon me “), and cannot possibly mean “ambidextrous.” No doubt Ehud, like other Benjamites, might have been trained to use the sling with the left hand, but it does not follow that he may not have had some accident which maimed the right hand; and if so it would avert all suspicion from him in his dreadful purpose. Ehud in that case was a Hebrew <span class= "ital">Scœvola. </span>Stobæus mentions some African tribes which, like the Benjamites, were “left-hand fighters” (<span class= "ital">aristeromachoi</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and for the same cause an Egyptian tribe was known as the <span class= "ital">Euonymitae. </span>The Greek <span class= "ital">Laius </span>has the same meaning.<p><span class= "bld">By him.</span>—Either because he was the chief of one of their houses (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-6.htm" title="And these are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to Manahath:">1Chronicles 8:6</a>), or perhaps because he had intimated to them his design. The narrative in Judges 20 falls chronologically in the days of Phinehas and, therefore, Ehud’s act occurred at a still earlier period after the conquest; for Ehud would hardly have been chosen for this honourable function after the terrible degradation and decimation of the tribe of Benjamin. Possibly Eglon’s invasion occurred soon after Joshua’s death.<p><span class= "bld">Sent a present.</span>—The Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">minchah, </span>here euphemistically used for “tribute,” as it is elsewhere.

The Israelites did ill, and the Moabites did worse; yet because God punishes the sins of his own people in this world, Israel is weakened, and Moab strengthened against them. If lesser troubles do not do the work, God will send greater. When Israel prays again, God raises up Ehud. As a judge, or minister of Divine justice, Ehud put to death Eglon, the king of Moab, and thus executed the judgments of God upon him as an enemy to God and Israel. But the law of being subject to principalities and powers in all things lawful, is the rule of our conduct. No such commissions are now given; to pretend to them is to blaspheme God. Notice Ehud's address to Eglon. What message from God but a message of vengeance can a proud rebel expect? Such a message is contained in the word of God; his ministers are boldly to declare it, without fearing the frown, or respecting the persons of sinners. But, blessed be God, they have to deliver a message of mercy and of free salvation; the message of vengeance belongs only to those who neglect the offers of grace. The consequence of this victory was, that the land had rest eighty years. It was a great while for the land to rest; yet what is that to the saints' everlasting rest in the heavenly Canaan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them up a deliverer - The very same words as are used at <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>.

This is varied, however, with the expressions &#1497;&#1497; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (&#1510;&#1500;&#1495;&#1492;) &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>, <a href="/judges/14-19.htm">Judges 14:19</a>; <a href="/judges/15-14.htm">Judges 15:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/11-6.htm">1 Samuel 11:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) and &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1508; &#1500;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; &#1497;&#1497; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, "the Spirit of Jehovah clothed the man" (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>). Of these the former denotes the operations of the Divine Spirit in overcoming the resistance of the natural will of man, whilst the latter represents the Spirit of God as a power which envelopes or covers a man. The recipients and bearers of this Spirit were thereby endowed with the power to perform miraculous deeds, in which the Spirit of God that came upon them manifested itself generally in the ability to prophesy (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-14.htm">2 Chronicles 20:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>), but also in the power to work miracles or to accomplish deeds which surpassed the courage and strength of the natural man. The latter was more especially the case with the judges; hence the Chaldee paraphrases "the Spirit of Jehovah" in <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a> as the spirit of might from the Lord;" though in the passage before us it gives the erroneous interpretation &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, "the spirit of prophecy." Kimchi also understands it as signifying "the spirit of bravery, under the instigation of which he was able fearlessly to enter upon the war with Chushan." But we are hardly at liberty to split up the different powers of the Spirit of God in this manner, and to restrict its operations upon the judges to the spirit of strength and bravery alone. The judges not only attacked the enemy courageously and with success, but they also judged the nation, for which the spirit of wisdom and understanding was indispensably necessary, and put down idolatry (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18-19</a>), which they could not have done without the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. "And he judged Israel and went out to war." The position of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; before &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488; does not warrant us in explaining &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; as signifying "he began to discharge the functions of a judge," as Rosenmller has done: for &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; must not be limited to a settlement of the civil disputes of the people, but means to restore right in Israel, whether towards its heathen oppressors, or with regard to the attitude of the nation towards the Lord. "And the Lord gave Chushan-rishathaim into his hand (cf. <a href="/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>, etc.), and his hand became strong over him;" i.e., he overcame him (cf. <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a>), or smote him, so that he was obliged to vacate the land. In consequence of this victory, and the land had rest from war (cf. <a href="/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>) forty years. "And then Othniel died:" the expression &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; with &#1493; consec. does not necessarily imply that Othniel did not die for forty years, but simply that he died after rest had been restored to the land. </body></html>
