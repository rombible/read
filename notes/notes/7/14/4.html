Shall one, not only an Israelite, but a Nazarite, devoted to the Lord, covet to become one with a worshipper of Dagon? It does not appear that he had any reason to think her wise or virtuous, or any way likely to be a help meet for him; but he saw something in her agreeable to his fancy. He that, in the choice of a wife, is only guided by his eye, and governed by his fancy, must afterwards thank himself if he find a Philistine in his arms. Yet it was well done not to proceed till Samson had made his parents acquainted with the matter. Children ought not to marry, nor to move towards it, without the advice and consent of their parents. Samson's parents did well to dissuade him from yoking himself unequally with unbelievers. It seems that it pleased God to leave Samson to follow his own inclinations, intending to bring out good from his conduct; and his parents consented, because he was bent upon it. However, his example is not recorded for us to do likewise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His father and mother very properly opposed Samson's marriage with a Pagan woman, the daughter of the oppressors of his race. But they could not prevail, because it was the secret purpose of God by these means to "seek occasion" against the Philistines; i. e. to make the misconduct of the father of Samson's wife, which He foresaw, the occasion of destruction to the Philistines.

Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren&#8212;that is, "of thine own tribe"&#8212;a Danite woman.<p>Samson said &#8230; Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well&#8212;literally, "she is right in mine eyes"; not by her beautiful countenance or handsome figure, but right or fit for his purpose. And this throws light on the historian's remark in reference to the resistance of his parents: they "knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines"&#8212;rather, "from the Philistines"&#8212;originating on their side. The Lord, by a course of retributive proceedings, was about to destroy the Philistine power, and the means which He meant to employ was not the forces of a numerous army, as in the case of the preceding judges, but the miraculous prowess of the single-handed champion of Israel. In these circumstances, the provocation to hostilities could only spring out of a private quarrel, and this marriage scheme was doubtless suggested by the secret influence of the Spirit as the best way of accomplishing the intended result.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He sought an occasion against the Philistines; </span> which he knew by very probable conjecture, if not by particular inspiration, that marriage would give him many ways. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his father and mother knew not that it was of the Lord,.... That he should marry this uncircumcised Philistine; Samson knew it was, and that his desire of having her in marriage did not arise from carnal affection to her merely, being captivated with her beauty and external form, for she was not so very fair, her younger sister was fairer than she, <a href="/judges/15-2.htm">Judges 15:2</a> but he perceived it was the mind and will of God that he should take such a person to wife, by the impulse of the Spirit of God upon him, pointing it, unto him, inclining and urging him to it, suggesting the end and design of it, and the opportunity it would give him of quarrelling with the Philistines, and taking vengeance on them; but this his parents were ignorant of, nor did he let them know that this was of God: <p>that he sought an occasion against the Philistines; in this way, by this means; they might know he sought to get an opportunity to be avenged on them for their oppression, and to attempt the deliverance of Israel; but they knew not that it was the will of God that a way should be opened for it by this means. Samson might be directed by the Lord to reason thus in his mind, that if he proposed to the Philistines to marry one of their daughters, and they should reject his proposal, this would give him a reason to fall out with them, and fall upon them; and if they should agree to such a match, he might expect they would be kind to him, and to his people for his sake, being in alliance with them, or he should resent it, and take occasion from hence to come to a quarrel with them: <p>for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel; had invaded their country, and dwelt in their cities, and made them tributary to them, and used them ill; which Samson observing, was provoked to seek an opportunity of avenging the injuries done them, and of delivering them, and he was directed to it this way. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But his father and his mother knew not that it <i>was</i> of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</span><p>(b) To fight against them for the deliverance of Israel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.
