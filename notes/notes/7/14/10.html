But the victory of Christ over Satan, by means of his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation that followed to him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritual advantages to his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death, that devouring monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of his horror, forwards the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and other senses, out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong, sweetness. Samson's companions obliged his wife to get the explanation from him. A worldly wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as an enemy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to betray him. No union can be comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted, without danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of our corrupt nature. His chief advantage against us arises from his correspondence with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This proved an occasion of weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well for us, if the unkindness we meet with from the world, and our disappointments in it, obliged us by faith and prayer to return to our heavenly Father's house, and to rest there. See how little confidence is to be put in man. Whatever pretence of friendship may be made, a real Philistine will soon be weary of a true Israelite.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made a feast ... - This was the wedding-feast, protracted in this instance seven days, in that of Tobias (Tobit 8:19) fourteen days.

At Timnath, whom Samson had espoused; the Targum is,"about the business of the woman;''about the consummation of the marriage with her; they all three went, the father, the mother, and the son, as appears from the preceding verse: <p>for Samson made a feast, for so used the young men to do; at the time of marriage; this was the nuptial feast common in all nations; but it seems the custom now and here was for the bridegroom to make it; whereas from other instances we learn, that the father of the bridegroom used to make it,, <a href="/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2</a> and the Vulgate Latin version here renders it: <p>and he made a feast for his son Samson; the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions add, seven days, and so long this feast was kept, <a href="/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>. Now this marriage of Samson with a daughter of the Philistines was a type of the marriage of Christ with his people, especially with the Gentile church, such as were not of the commonwealth of Israel, but sinners of the Gentiles, very ignorant of divine things, reproached by the Jews, and their calling an offence to them; and may fitly express the love of Christ to his church, though unworthy of it, which is a love of complacency and delight, arising from his own good will and pleasure, and not owing to any superior beauty, excellence, worth, or worthiness in them, they being no better than others, children of wrath, even as others, see <a href="/judges/15-2.htm">Judges 15:2</a> as well as there is an agreement in the manner of his obtaining and betrothing her, which was by applying to his father to get her for him, and being got and given, be betrothed her; so Christ asked his people of his father to be his spouse, which request being obtained, he betrothed them to himself in righteousness; and the Gospel feast, or ministry of the word, is kept and continued on account of it, <a href="/psalms/21-2.htm">Psalm 21:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> feast; for so used the young men to do.</span><p>(d) Meaning when he was married.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">his father</span>] Again, an insertion.

The <span class="ital">young men</span> mean bridegrooms.

It is not clear what is meant by this mention of his father alone; but it was probably some part of the wedding etiquette that the father should go to the bride first alone; perhaps, as Kimehi says, to give her notice of the bridegroom's approach, that she might get ready. Among the preparations may have been the selection of the thirty young men to be "the children of the bride-chamber" (<a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>). As these were all Philistines, the inference is that they were selected by the bride, just as with us the bride has the privilege of choosing the minister who is to officiate at the marriage. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>His parents expressed their astonishment at the choice, and asked him whether there was not a woman among the daughters of his brethren (i.e., the members of his own tribe), or among all his people, that he should want to fetch one from the Philistines, the uncircumcised. But Samson repeated his request, because the daughter of the Philistines pleased him. The aversion of his parents to the marriage was well founded, as such a marriage was not in accordance with the law. It is true that the only marriages expressly prohibited in <a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>, are marriages with Canaanitish women; but the reason assigned for this prohibition was equally applicable to marriages with daughters of the Philistines. In fact, the Philistines are reckoned among the Canaanites in <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a> upon the very same ground. But Samson was acting under a higher impulse, whereas his parents did not know that it was from Jehovah, i.e., that Jehovah had so planned it; "for Samson was seeking an opportunity on account of the Philistines," i.e., an occasion to quarrel with them, because, as is afterwards added in the form of an explanatory circumstantial clause, the Philistines had dominion over Israel at that time. &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., an opportunity (cf. &#1492;&#1514;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;,   <a href="/2_kings/5-7.htm">2 Kings 5:7</a>). </body></html>
