Young people consider not how they exposed themselves to the roaring lion that seeks to devour, when they wander from their prudent, pious parents. Nor do men consider what lions lurk in the vineyards, the vineyards of red wines.

Mahaneh-dan, the camp of Dan, was the name given to the district in which the Danites who emigrated, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a>, from the inheritance of their tribe, had pitched their encampment behind, i.e., to the west of, Kirjath-jearim, or according to this verse, between Zorea and Eshtaol. The situation cannot be determined precisely, as the situation of Eshtaol itself has not been discovered yet (see at <a href="/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>). It was there that Samson lived with his parents, judging from <a href="/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a>. The meaning of this verse, which forms the introduction to the following account of the acts of Samson, is simply that Samson was there seized by the Spirit of Jehovah, and impelled to commence the conflict with the Philistines. </body></html>
