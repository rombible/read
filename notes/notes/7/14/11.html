But the victory of Christ over Satan, by means of his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation that followed to him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritual advantages to his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death, that devouring monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of his horror, forwards the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and other senses, out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong, sweetness. Samson's companions obliged his wife to get the explanation from him. A worldly wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as an enemy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to betray him. No union can be comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted, without danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of our corrupt nature. His chief advantage against us arises from his correspondence with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This proved an occasion of weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well for us, if the unkindness we meet with from the world, and our disappointments in it, obliged us by faith and prayer to return to our heavenly Father's house, and to rest there. See how little confidence is to be put in man. Whatever pretence of friendship may be made, a real Philistine will soon be weary of a true Israelite.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thirty companions - These were "the children of the bride-chamber" (<a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>; see <a href="/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20</a>).

A etc. read <span class="ital">because they feared him; they</span> must be the Philistines, though not mentioned in the context. The sight of Samson, <span class="ital">or</span> their fear of him, induced the Philistines to procure thirty <span class="ital">companions</span> (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/14-20.htm" title="But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.">Jdg 14:20</a></span>), nominally as friends and supporters, but really in self-defence. The text does not give an altogether satisfactory sense, and may have suffered from alterations. If we read <span class="ital">that he brought</span>, which would be an improvement, we must treat <span class="ital">when they saw him</span> as an interpolation. This is Moore’s view, and Budde proposes further re-arrangements; the original state of the verse is not easy to recover. The <span class="ital">thirty</span> (cf. <a href="/songs/3-7.htm" title="Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; three score valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.">Song of Solomon 3:7</a> <span class="ital">sixty</span>) are of course Philistines, <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/14-18.htm" title="And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?

At village weddings in Syria the bridegroom is still attended by a body-guard of young men with their leader (<span class="ital"><a href="/judges/14-20.htm" title="But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.">Jdg 14:20</a></span>), who superintend the festivities and bear the cost. This ancient institution probably goes back to days when the party really needed protection (Wetzstein, <span class="ital">Z. f.

We still see a strong resemblance to the wedding arrangements referred to in <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, and Matthew 25:1-12; only in this case they were young men instead of young women who went out to meet the bridegroom. We may observe, by the way, that the scale of the wedding feast, as regards numbers and duration, indicates that Samson s family was one of wealth and position. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Samson went down with his parents to Timnath, a young lion came roaring towards him at the vineyards of that town. Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, so that he tore the lion in pieces as a kid is torn (lit. "like the tearing in pieces of the kid"), although he had nothing, i.e., no weapon, in his hand. David, when a shepherd, and the hero Benaiah, also slew lions (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>); and even at the present day Arabs sometimes kill lions with a staff (see Winer, Bibl. R. W. Art. Lwe). Samson's supernatural strength, the effect of the Spirit of Jehovah, which came upon him, was simply manifested in the fact that he tore the lion in pieces without any weapon whatever in his hand. But he said nothing about it to his parents, who were not eyewitnesses of the deed. This remark is introduced in connection with what follows. </body></html>
