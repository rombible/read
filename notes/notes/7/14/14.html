Josephus gives the riddle in the form,”the all-devouring having generated sweet food from itself, though itself far from sweet” (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 8, § 6). The whole of Samson’s life has been described by Ewald as “a charming poetic picture, in which the interspersed verses gleam forth like the brightest pearls in a circlet.” It must be confessed that the riddle was hardly a fair one, for the event to which it alluded was most unusual, and no one could have guessed such a riddle without some clue; for—<p>“ ’Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb<p>In the dead carrion.”<p>Shakespeare: <span class= "ital">Henry V., </span>ii. 4.<p>Cassel quotes a curious parallel from the legends of North Germany. The judges offer a woman her husband’s life if she can make a riddle which they cannot guess. On her way to the court she had found the carcase of a horse in which a bird had built its nest and hatched six young ones, which she took away. Her riddle was (I venture rudely to translate the rude old lines):—<p>“As hitherwards on my way I sped,<p>I took the living out of the dead,<p>Six were thus of the seventh made quit:—<p>To rede my riddle, my lords, ‘tis fit.”<p>The judges failed, and the husband was spared (Mullen-hof, <span class= "ital">Sagen, </span>p. 506).<p><span class= "bld">In three days.</span>—It is hard to see why this is mentioned if it was only on the <span class= "ital">seventh </span>day (<a href="/judges/14-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?">Judges 14:15</a>) that they tried the unfair means of inducing Samson’s wife to reveal the secret. Bishop Hervey conjectures, with much probability, that we should read <span class= "ital">shesheth </span>“six,” for <span class= "ital">shelsheth, </span>“four.” The LXX. and Syriac read “on the fourth day,” and <span class= "greekheb">ד</span> (7) may easily have been confused with <span class= "greekheb">ד</span> (4).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:10-20 Samson's riddle literally meant no more than that he had got honey, for food and for pleasure, from the lion, which in its strength and fury was ready to devour him. But the victory of Christ over Satan, by means of his humiliation, agonies, and death, and the exaltation that followed to him, with the glory thence to the Father, and spiritual advantages to his people, seem directly alluded to. And even death, that devouring monster, being robbed of his sting, and stripped of his horror, forwards the soul to the realms of bliss. In these and other senses, out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong, sweetness. Samson's companions obliged his wife to get the explanation from him. A worldly wife, or a worldly friend, is to a godly man as an enemy in the camp, who will watch every opportunity to betray him. No union can be comfortable or lasting, where secrets cannot be intrusted, without danger of being divulged. Satan, in his temptations, could not do us the mischief he does, if he did not plough with the heifer of our corrupt nature. His chief advantage against us arises from his correspondence with our deceitful hearts and inbred lusts. This proved an occasion of weaning Samson from his new relations. It were well for us, if the unkindness we meet with from the world, and our disappointments in it, obliged us by faith and prayer to return to our heavenly Father's house, and to rest there. See how little confidence is to be put in man.

His Riddle.<p>12-18. I will now put forth a riddle&#8212;Riddles are a favorite Oriental amusement at festive entertainments of this nature, and rewards are offered to those who give the solution. Samson's riddle related to honey in the lion's carcass. The prize he offered was thirty sindinim, or shirts, and thirty changes of garments, probably woolen. Three days were passed in vain attempts to unravel the enigma. The festive week was fast drawing to a close when they secretly enlisted the services of the newly married wife, who having got the secret, revealed it to her friends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Out of that strong and devouring creature, the lion, came forth sweet meat, to wit, honey; withal it is covertly implied, that the Philistines, though now they had strength on their side, and dominion over Israel, whom they did devour upon all occasions, yet at last they should become meat to the Israelites. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them, out of the eater came forth meat,.... Out of a devouring eater, such as the lion is, came forth honey, or that was taken out of it, which Samson, and his father and mother, ate of, and which was the common food of some persons, as of John the Baptist: <p>and out of the strong came forth sweetness: not only out of that which was strong in body while alive, but of a strong and ill scent, as the carcass of a dead lion is, and out of that came forth honey, than which nothing is sweeter. Josephus (m) expresses it,"that which devours all things furnishes out pleasant food, when that itself is altogether unpleasant:" <p>and they could not in three days expound the riddle; so long they laboured to find it out, but then began to despair of it. <p>(m) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 8. sect. 6. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.

On the way "he turned aside (from the road) to see the carcase of the lion; and behold a swarm of bees was in the body of the lion, also honey." The word &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, which only occurs here, is derived from &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;, like &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; from &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;, and is synonymous with &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, cadaver, and signifies not the mere skeleton, as bees would not form their hive in such a place, but the carcase of the lion, which had been thoroughly dried up by the heat of the sun, without passing into a state of putrefaction. "In the desert of Arabia the heat of a sultry season will often dry up all the moisture of men or camels that have fallen dead, within twenty-four hours of their decease, without their passing into a state of decomposition and putrefaction, so that they remain for a long time like mummies, without change and without stench" (Rosenmller, Bibl. Althk. iv. 2, p. 424). In a carcase dried up in this way, a swarm of bees might form their hive, just as well as in the hollow trunks of trees, or clefts in the rock, or where wild bees are accustomed to form them, notwithstanding the fact that bees avoid both dead bodies and carrion (see Bochart, Hieroz, ed. Ros. iii. p. 355). </body></html>
