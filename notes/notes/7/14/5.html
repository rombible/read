Young people consider not how they exposed themselves to the roaring lion that seeks to devour, when they wander from their prudent, pious parents. Nor do men consider what lions lurk in the vineyards, the vineyards of red wines.

His rending and killing the shaggy monster, without any weapon in his hand, were accomplished by that superhuman courage and strength which the occasional influences of the Spirit enabled him to put forth, and by the exertion of which, in such private incidental circumstances, he was gradually trained to confide in them for the more public work to which he was destined.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His father and his mother</span> accompanied him, either because they were now acquainted with his design, or to order the circumstances of that action which they saw he was set upon, or to watch if they could find any occasion to take him off from his intention. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Came to the vineyards of Timnath, </span> whither he had turned aside, either by a Divine impulse, or upon some real or pretended occasion. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,....

Probably the whole district under the hills was a succession of vineyards, like the country round Bordeaux. Samson had left the road along which his father and mother were walking, at a pace, perhaps, too slow for his youthful energy, and had plunged into the vineyards. Of a sudden a young lion, - a term designating a lion between the age of a cub and a full-grown lion, - brought there, perhaps, in pursuit of the foxes or jackals, which often had their holes in vineyards (<a href="/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>), roared against him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The promise of God was fulfilled. the boy whom the woman bare received the name of Samson. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (lxx, &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;) does not mean sun-like, hero of the sun, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; (the sun), but, as Josephus explains it (Ant. v. 8, 4), &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, the strong or daring one, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1501;, from the intensive from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, in its original sense to be strong or daring, not "to devastate." &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; is an analogous word: lit. to be powerful, then to act powerfully, to devastate.
