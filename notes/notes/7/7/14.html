The fact that this Bath Kol echoed the promise which Gideon had already received (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, get you down to the host; for I have delivered it into your hand.">Judges 7:9</a>) would give it additional force.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:9-15 The dream seemed to have little meaning in it; but the interpretation evidently proved the whole to be from the Lord, and discovered that the name of Gideon had filled the Midianites with terror. Gideon took this as a sure pledge of success; without delay he worshipped and praised God, and returned with confidence to his three hundred men. Wherever we are, we may speak to God, and worship him. God must have the praise of that which encourages our faith. And his providence must be acknowledged in events, though small and seemingly accidental.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon - The word rendered tumbled in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>, is rather descriptive of a sword brandished (compare <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). Hence, the interpretation "the sword of Gideon." Hearing this dream and the interpretation would convince Gideon that he was indeed under the guidance of God, and so assure him of God's aid; and secondly, it would show him that a panic had already fallen npon the mind of the enemy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian&#8212;This was a characteristic and very expressive dream for an Arab in the circumstances. The rolling down the hill, striking against the tents, and overturning them, naturally enough connected it in his mind with the position and meditated attack of the Israelitish leader. The circumstance of the cake, too, was very significant. Barley was usually the food of the poor, and of beasts; but most probably, from the widespread destruction of the crops by the invaders, multitudes must have been reduced to poor and scanty fare.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As there are many examples of. significant dreams given by God to heathens, as <span class="bld"> Ge 41 Da 2 Da 4</span>, so some of them had the gift of interpreting dreams; which they sometimes did by study and art, and sometimes by Divine direction, as in this case. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his fellow answered and said,.... As the dream was no doubt from God, so the interpretation of it was; it was he that put into the mind of the soldier's comrade to whom he told it to interpret it as follows; or otherwise in all likelihood he would never have thought of it: <p>this is nothing else save the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, a man of Israel; that is, this signifies nothing else, and a fit emblem it was of him and his little army. A cake is but a small thing, and, let it come tumbling as it will, can have no force or strength in it equal to overturn a tent; and a cake of barley is mean and contemptible; and a cake baked under ashes, or on coals, is what is soon and hastily done, and fitly represented the smallness and weakness of Gideon's army, their meanness and contemptibleness; the Israelites being, as Josephus (e) represents the soldier saying, the vilest of all the people of Asia; and those that were with Gideon were suddenly and hastily got together, raw and undisciplined, and very unfit to engage the veteran troops of the united forces of Midian, Amalek, and Arabia. It appears from hence that Gideon's name was well known in the camp of Midian, what was his descent, and his character as a valiant man, which is meant by <p>a man of Israel; namely, a courageous mighty man, and the very name of him might strike with terror: <p>for into his hands hath God delivered Midian and all his host; which the man concluded from this dream, and the interpretation of it suggested to him from God, and impressed upon his mind; which he speaks of with the greatest assurance and confidence, which he was inspired to do, for the strengthening of Gideon, and the encouragement of him to come down with his army, and fall on the host of Midian. <p>(e) Ut supra.

If, in accordance with usage, we translate <span class="ital">the men of Israel</span>, then it seems likely that the names of Gideon and his father were inserted to make the application more distinct. Some scholars would include <span class="ital">the sword</span> among the inserted words (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/7-20.htm" title="And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.">Jdg 7:20</a></span>), but this is hardly necessary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into</span> <span class="bld">their</span> <span class="ital">hand God hath delivered</span>] A foreigner uses the name <span class="ital">Elohim: Jehovah</span> is for Israelites; cf. <a href="/judges/3-20.htm" title="And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlor, which he had for himself alone.

Because, although both the dream and the interpretation were of God, for the encouragement of Gideon in his great undertaking, yet they followed the course of nature and the laws of psychology. The presentiment that God had delivered Midian into Gideon's hand is exactly like the terror in the minds of the Canaanites which preceded the arrival of Joshua (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"So they (the 300 picked men) took the provision of the people in their hand, and their (the people's) trumpets (the suffix points back to &#1492;&#1506;&#1501;, the people); and all the men of Israel (the 9700) he had sent away every one to his tents, i.e., to his home (see at <a href="/deuteronomy/16-7.htm">Deuteronomy 16:7</a>), and the three hundred men he had kept by himself; but the camp of the Midianites was below to him in the valley." These words bring the preparations for the battle to a close, and the last clause introduces the ensuing conflict and victory. In the first clause &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (the people) cannot be the subject, partly because of the actual sense, since the 300 warriors, who are no doubt the persons intended (cf. <a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>), cannot be called "the people," in distinction from "all the men of Israel," and partly also because of the expression &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1492;, which would be construed in that case without any article in violation of the ordinary rule. We must rather read &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1514;, as the lxx and the Chaldee have done. The 300 men took the provision of the people, i.e., provision for the war, from the people who had been sent away, and the war-trumpets; so that every one of the 300 had a trumpet now, and as the provision of the people was also probably kept in vessels or pitchers (caddim: <a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>), a jug as well. The subject to &#1497;&#1511;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is to be taken from the first clause of the seventh verse. The sentences which follow from &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; are circumstantial clauses, introduced to bring out distinctly the situation in which Gideon was now placed. &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, the opposite of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, to send away, signifies to hold fast, to keep back or by himself, as in <a href="/exodus/9-2.htm">Exodus 9:2</a>. &#1500;&#1493;, to him, Gideon, who was standing by the fountain of Harod with his 300 men, the situation of Midian was underneath in the valley (see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>, and <a href="/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>). </body></html>
