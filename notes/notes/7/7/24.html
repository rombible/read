Rather, <span class="accented">the hill country</span>, <span class="accented">of Ephraim.</span> For some reason Gideon had not invited the Ephraimites to join in the war before (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>); but now, seeing the extreme importance of seizing the fords of Jordan, so as to stop the escape of the Midianites, he sent messengers in all haste to the men of Ephraim, who accordingly "took the <span class="accented">waters</span> unto <span class="accented">Beth-barah</span> and Jordan." The <span class="accented">waters</span> seem to mean a number of streams running from the hill country of Ephraim into the Jordan, and which had to be crossed by the Midianites before they could reach the Jordan fords. The site of <span class="accented">Beth-barah</span> is unknown. It is not thought to be the same as <span class="accented">Bethabara beyond Jordan</span>, where John was baptising (<a href="/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>). <span class="accented">Beth-barah</span> must have been on the west of Jordan. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When therefore he had heard the dream related and interpreted, he worshipped, praising the Lord with joy, and returned to the camp to attack the enemy without delay. He then divided the 300 men into three companies, i.e., three attacking columns, and gave them all trumpets and empty pitchers, with torches in the pitchers in their hands. The pitchers were taken that they might hide the burning torches in them during their advance to surround the enemy's camp, and then increase the noise at the time of the attack, by dashing the pitchers to pieces (<a href="/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a>), and thus through the noise, as well as the sudden lighting up of the burning torches, deceive the enemy as to the strength of the army. At the same time he commanded them, "See from me, and do likewise," - a short expression for, As ye see me do, so do ye also (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, without the previous &#1499;&#1468;, or &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; as in <a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a>; see Ewald, 260, a.), - "I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me; ye also blow the trumpets round about the entire camp," which the 300 men divided into three companies were to surround, "and say, To the Lord and Gideon." According to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a>, this war-cry ran fully thus: "Sword to (for) the Lord and Gideon." This addition in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a>, however, does not warrant us in inserting "chereb" (sword) in the text here, as some of the early translators and MSS have done.<p>(Note: Similar stratagems to the one adopted by Gideon here are recorded by Polyaenus (Strateg. ii. c. 37) of Dicetas, at the taking of Heraea, and by Plutarch (Fabius Max. c. 6) of Hannibal, when he was surrounded and completely shut in by Fabius Maximus. An example from modern history is given by Niebuhr (Beschr. von Arabien, p. 304). About the middle of the eighteenth century two Arabian chiefs were fighting for the Imamate of Oman. One of them, Bel-Arab, besieged the other, Achmed ben Said, with four or five thousand men, in a small castle on the mountain. But the latter slipped out of the castle, collected together several hundred men, gave every soldier a sign upon his head, that they might be able to distinguish friends from foes, and sent small companies to all the passes. Every one had a trumpet to blow at a given signal, and thus create a noise at the same time on every side. The whole of the opposing army was thrown in this way into disorder, since they found all the passes occupied, and imagined the hostile army to be as great as the noise.) </body></html>
