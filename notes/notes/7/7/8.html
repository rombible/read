Provisions would be scarce in the neighbourhood of so vast a host, and it would be the desire of all that the brave 300 should be well supplied. The reason for taking 300 rams’ horns would soon appear; and, indeed, but for this verse we might well wonder how each of the 300 came to have a horn of his own. Their “pitchers” were probably those in which the provisions had been carried.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/7-8.htm" title="So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.">Jdg 7:8</a>. </span><span class="ital">Their trumpets — </span>That is, the trumpets belonging to the whole army, which he retained for the use following.

God provides that the praise of victory may be wholly to himself, by appointing only three hundred men to be employed. Activity and prudence go with dependence upon God for help in our lawful undertakings. When the Lord sees that men would overlook him, and through unbelief, would shrink from perilous services, or that through pride they would vaunt themselves against him, he will set them aside, and do his work by other instruments. Pretences will be found by many, for deserting the cause and escaping the cross. But though a religious society may thus be made fewer in numbers, yet it will gain as to purity, and may expect an increased blessing from the Lord. God chooses to employ such as are not only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. They grudged not at the liberty of the others who were dismissed. In doing the duties required by God, we must not regard the forwardness or backwardness of others, nor what they do, but what God looks for at our hands. He is a rare person who can endure that others should excel him in gifts or blessings, or in liberty; so that we may say, it is by the special grace of God that we regard what God says to us, and not look to men what they do.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense is, "And they (the three hundred) took the victuals and trumpets of the people (all the people of <a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>) into their hands." so that each of the three hundred should have a trumpet and a pitcher. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley&#8212;Attention to the relative position of the parties is of the greatest importance to an understanding of what follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And their trumpets, </span> i.e. the trumpets belonging to the whole army, even to those who were gone away, which he retained for the use here following.

That is, the three hundred took victuals of those that departed, as much as was necessary for them, and also their trumpets, being directed thereunto by Gideon, no doubt; perhaps they took all the trumpets they had; however, as many as would furnish every man with one. And from hence it appears, that these three hundred that were ordered to stay and go with Gideon were unarmed men, at least could carry no arms in their hands; for in one hand they carried their victuals, and in the other hand their trumpets, so that the salvation wrought by them would most clearly appear to be of the Lord: <p>and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent; not to his tent in the army, but to his own house, in the tribe and city to which he belonged: and retained these three hundred men; that had lapped water, to engage with the Midianites and their associates: <p>and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley; in the valley of Jezreel; for it seems as if Gideon, after he had brought down his men to the water to be tried, went up to the hill again with his three hundred men only, to wait the divine orders, when he should attack the army of Midian below him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">So the people took victuals in their hand</span>] Not a strict transl. of the original, which must mean <span class="ital">So they took the provisions of the people in their hand</span> (LXX, marg.), though the text requires correction to yield this meaning.

Nevertheless the Lord said to Gideon, "The people that are with thee are too many for me to give Midian into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My hand hath helped me." &#1512;&#1489; followed by &#1502;&#1503; is to be understood as a comparative. Gideon was therefore to have a proclamation made before all the people: "Whosoever is fearful and despondent, let him turn and go back from Mount Gilead." The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1510;&#1508;&#1512;, judging from the Arabic, which signifies to plait, viz., hair, ropes, etc., and the noun &#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, a circle or circuitous orbit, probably signifies to twist one's self round; hence in this instance to return in windings, to slink away in bypaths. The expression "from Mount Gilead," however, is very obscure. The mountain (or the mountains) of Gilead was on the eastern side of the Jordan; but the Israelitish army was encamped in or near the plain of Jezreel, in the country to the west of the Jordan, and had been gathered from the western tribes alone; so that even the inadmissible rendering, Let him turn and go home to the mountains of Gilead, would not give any appropriate sense. The only course left therefore is either to pronounce it an error of the text, as Clericus and Bertheau have done, and to regard "Gilead" as a mistake for "Gilboa," or to conclude that there was also a mountain or mountain range named Gilead by the plain of Jezreel in western Palestine, just as, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>, there was a mountain, or range of mountains, called Seir, in the territory of Judah, of which nothing further is known. The appeal which Gideon is here directed to make to the army was prescribed in the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>) for every war in which the Israelites should be engaged, and its general object was to fortify the spirit of the army be removing the cowardly and desponding. But in the case before us the intention of the Lord was to deprive His people of all ground for self-glorification. Hence the result of the appeal was one which Gideon himself certainly did not expect, - namely, that more than two-thirds of the soldiers gathered round him - 22,000 men of the people - turned back, and only 10,000 remained.</body></html>
