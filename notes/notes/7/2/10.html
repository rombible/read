The nation made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil they had done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, even the meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations round about them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to his promises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it. The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they became saviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, there shall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israelites were not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the good ways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Their punishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they were beaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corrupt appetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves, under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find it true by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand with ourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted and grounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Let us declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all our days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All that generation - i. e. the main body of those who were grown-up men at the time of the conquest of Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-10. And when Joshua had let the people go&#8212;This passage is a repetition of Jos 24:29-31. It was inserted here to give the reader the reasons which called forth so strong and severe a rebuke from the angel of the Lord. During the lifetime of the first occupiers, who retained a vivid recollection of all the miracles and judgments which they had witnessed in Egypt and the desert, the national character stood high for faith and piety. But, in course of time, a new race arose who were strangers to all the hallowed and solemnizing experience of their fathers, and too readily yielded to the corrupting influences of the idolatry that surrounded them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which knew not the Lord; </span> which had no experimental nor serious and affectionate knowledge of God, nor of his works. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers,.... Were dead and buried, that is, the greatest part of those that were contemporaries with the elders that outlived Joshua; for they might not be all dead, at least not all that came out of Egypt, and still less all that came into the land of Canaan; for, according to the computation of Ben Gersom, the time of Joshua and the elders were but twenty seven years; and there were no more than sixty seven years from their coming out of Egypt to this time; and no doubt there were men living of eighty years of age and more, but these might be but few: <p>and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord; so as to love, fear, serve, and worship him; did not own him to be the one only living and true God, otherwise they must know him nationally, being educated in the true religion: <p>nor yet the works which he had done for Israel; some of them, as before observed, might have seen the works and wonders of the Lord for Israel, at their first coming out of Egypt; though not being wise, as the above writer observes, it had no effect upon them, to keep them from doing evil in the sight of God; and they all of them had been informed of them, and many had seen, and must have had personal knowledge of what was done for them at their coming into the land of Canaan; but not a practical knowledge, or such as had any influence upon them, to preserve them from idolatry. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">were gathered unto their fathers</span>] This expression (as here only in <a href="/2_kings/22-20.htm" title="Behold therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring on this place.

According to this writer the death of Joshua marked a cleavage between the age of faith and the age of deterioration; the prophets Hosea (<a href="/judges/9-10.htm" title="And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.">Jdg 9:10</a> ff.) and Ezekiel (16) take an even gloomier view.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which know not the Lord</span>, etc. The memory of God's great works gradually faded away, and with this memory their influence upon the hearts of the people. The seductions of idolatry and the influence of heathen example were ever fresh and powerful. Had the people obeyed the voice of the Lord, the idolatry and the idolaters would have been out of the way. We may notice by the way the value to the Church of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in keeping alive a perpetual memory of Christ's precious death until his coming again. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The people broke out into loud weeping on account of this reproof. And since the weeping, from which the place received the name of Bochim, was a sign of their grief on account of their sin, this grief led on to such repentance that "they sacrificed there unto the Lord," no doubt presenting sin-offerings and burnt-offerings, that they might obtain mercy and the forgiveness of their sins. It does not follow from this sacrifice, however, that the tabernacle or the ark of the covenant was to be found at Bochim. In any place where the Lord appeared to His people, sacrifices might be offered to Him (see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-20.htm">Judges 6:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>, <a href="/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>; <a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>.; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>, and the commentary of <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>). On the other hand, it does follow from the sacrifice at Bochim, where there was no sanctuary of Jehovah, that the person who appeared to the people was not a prophet, nor even an ordinary angel, but the angel of the Lord, who is essentially one with Jehovah. </body></html>
