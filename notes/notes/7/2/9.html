The nation made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God, as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful to him. Their punishment answered to the evil they had done. They served the gods of the nations round about them, even the meanest, and God made them serve the princes of the nations round about them, even the meanest. Those who have found God true to his promises, may be sure that he will be as true to his threatenings. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could not for pity do it. The Lord was with the judges when he raised them up, and so they became saviours. In the days of the greatest distress of the church, there shall be some whom God will find or make fit to help it. The Israelites were not thoroughly reformed; so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately bent to backslide. Thus those who have forsaken the good ways of God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts hardened. Their punishment was, that the Canaanites were spared, and so they were beaten with their own rod. Men cherish and indulge their corrupt appetites and passions; therefore God justly leaves them to themselves, under the power of their sins, which will be their ruin. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it, until by making bold with temptation we find it true by sad experience. We need to examine how matters stand with ourselves, and to pray without ceasing, that we may be rooted and grounded in love, and that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith. Let us declare war against every sin, and follow after holiness all our days.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The servant of the Lord - This is a title especially given to Moses <a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>.

During the lifetime of the first occupiers, who retained a vivid recollection of all the miracles and judgments which they had witnessed in Egypt and the desert, the national character stood high for faith and piety. But, in course of time, a new race arose who were strangers to all the hallowed and solemnizing experience of their fathers, and too readily yielded to the corrupting influences of the idolatry that surrounded them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Timnath-heres, </span> called <span class="ital">Timnath-serah</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/19-50.htm" title="According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelled therein.">Joshua 19:50</a> <a href="/joshua/24-30.htm" title="And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.">Joshua 24:30</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres,....

A later, mediaeval, tradition fixes the site at Hâris, about 9 m. S.W. of Shechem (Nâblus). Timnath-ḥeres, lit. ‘(sacred) territory of the Sun’ (cf.
