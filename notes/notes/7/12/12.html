Jephthah died&#8212;After a government of six years, this mighty man of valor died; and however difficult it may be for us to understand some passages in his history, he has been ranked by apostolic authority among the worthies of the ancient church.

Both probably should be pronounced alike, as in the LXX, for the consonants are practically identical; and the form should be Elon, this being the name of one of the ‘sons,’ i.e. families, of Zebulun, <a href="/genesis/46-14.htm" title="And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.">Genesis 46:14</a>, <a href="/numbers/26-26.htm" title="Of the sons of Zebulun after their families: of Sered, the family of the Sardites: of Elon, the family of the Elonites: of Jahleel, the family of the Jahleelites.">Numbers 26:26</a>.

See on <a href="/judges/10-2.htm" title="And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.">Jdg 10:2</a>. In these notices of the Minor Judges have we traditions of individuals or of clans? Partly, perhaps, of the one and partly of the other. The names are clan-names; the ‘sons’ and ‘daughters’ (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Jdg 10:4</a>, <a href="/judges/12-9.htm" title="And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.

It is remarkable that the two names <span class="accented">Elon</span> and <span class="accented">Aijalon</span> are identical in Hebrew as far as the consonants are concerned. It looks as if Aijalon, which is not mentioned among the Zebulonite cities in <a href="/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10-16</a>, was named from Elon, its possessor. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the Gileadites had beaten the Ephraimites, they took the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites (or towards Ephraim: see <a href="/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>; <a href="/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24</a>), to cut off their retreat and prevent their return to their homes. And "when fugitives of Ephraim wanted to cross, the men of Gilead asked them, Art thou Ephrathi," i.e., an Ephraimite? And if he said no, they made him pronounce the word Shibboleth (a stream or flood, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>, <a href="/psalms/69-16.htm">Psalm 69:16</a>; not an ear of corn, which is quite unsuitable here); "and if he said, Sibboleth, not taking care to pronounce it correctly, they laid hold of him and put him to death at the fords of the Jordan." In this manner there fell at that time, i.e., during the whole war, 42,000 Ephraimites. The "fugitives of Ephraim" were the Ephraimites who had escaped from the battle and wished to return home. The expression is used here in its ordinary sense, and not with the contemptuous sense in which the Ephraimites had used it in <a href="/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4</a>. From this history we learn quite casually that the Ephraimites generally pronounced sh (shin) like s (samech). &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; is used elliptically for &#1500;&#1489; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to direct his heart to anything, pay heed (compare <a href="/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>, with <a href="/2_chronicles/12-14.htm">2 Chronicles 12:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-19.htm">2 Chronicles 30:19</a>). </body></html>
