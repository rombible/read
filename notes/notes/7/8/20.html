Little did they think to have heard of this so long after; but murder seldom goes unpunished in this life. Sins long forgotten by man, must be accounted for to God.

But it is well for us to be made aware how the best and greatest men cannot rise above the manners and received maxims of their age; and it teaches us to make due allowance for the faults of uncivilised men with whom we have to do, whether Afghans, or Zulus, or others. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Punishment of the Towns of Succoth and Pnuel, and Execution of the Captures Kings of Midian.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13-14</a><p>Gideon returned victorious from the war, &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1505; &#1502;&#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "from by the ascent (or mountain road) of Hecheres," a place in front of the town of Succoth, with which we are not acquainted.
