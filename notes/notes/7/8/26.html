It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family.

If the rings, like that given to Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>), weighed each half a shekel, they would be the spoil of 3400 dead bodies.

Perhaps the <span class="accented">ornaments</span> mentioned in ver. 21 as on the camels' necks were suspended to these chains. In <a href="/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a> the <span class="accented">chain</span> is mentioned as an ornament of a woman's neck; in <a href="/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> of a man's neck. Many interpreters understand these last-mentioned articles as not being part of Gideon's spoil, but being the people's portion. But it seems much more probable that the spoil of the kings should be Gideon's portion, as indeed ver. 21 implies. It is best, therefore, to take all these articles as being the property of the kings, and to understand the writer to tell us that Gideon had the rings, which were the people's spoil, in addition to all the spoil which naturally fell to his own share. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After punishing these cities, Gideon repaid the two kings of Midian, who had been taken prisoners, according to their doings. From the judicial proceedings instituted with regard to them (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18</a>, <a href="/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>), we learn that these kings had put the brothers of Gideon to death, and apparently not in open fight; but they had murdered them in an unrighteous and cruel manner. And Gideon made them atone for this with their own lives, according to the strict jus talionis. &#1488;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492;, in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-18.htm">Judges 8:18</a>, does not mean where? but "in what condition, of what form, were the men whom he slew at Tabor?" i.e., either in the city of Tabor or at Mount Tabor (see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>, and <a href="/joshua/19-22.htm">Joshua 19:22</a>). The kings replied: "As thou so they" (those men), i.e., they were all as stately as thou art, "every one like the form of kings' sons." &#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, one, for every one, like &#1488;&#1495;&#1491; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>, or more frequently &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; alone. As the men who had been slain were Gideon's own brothers, he swore to those who had done the deed, i.e., to the two kings, "As truly as Jehovah liveth, if ye had let them live I should not have put you to death;" and then commanded his first-born son Jether to slay them, for the purpose of adding the disgrace of falling by the hand of a boy. "But the boy drew not his sword from fear, because he was yet a boy." And the kings then said to Gideon, "Rise thou and stab us, for as the man so is his strength," i.e., such strength does not belong to a boy, but to a man. Thereupon Gideon slew them, and took the little moons upon the necks of their camels as booty. "The little moons" were crescent-shaped ornaments of silver or gold, such as men and women wore upon their necks (see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/3-18.htm">Isaiah 3:18</a>), and which they also hung upon the necks of camels-a custom still prevalent in Arabia (see Schrder, de vestitu mul. hebr. pp. 39, 40, and Wellsted, Reisen in Arab. i. p. 209). </body></html>
