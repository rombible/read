It is not said that he tormented them till they expired, and therefore he perhaps only put them to torture for some time; but if he put them to death, then the expression, <span class="ital">with them he taught the men of Succoth, </span>must mean, that he made their death an example to the rest of the inhabitants, to terrify them from such ungenerous behaviour for the future. “As their crime was the same,” says Dr. Dodd, “as that of the men of Penuel, it seems likely that it was a punishment unto death. However severe, this chastisement was just. In refusing Gideon the succour which he demanded for the troops employed to save the state, they rendered themselves guilty of a species of rebellion; they sinned against the laws of humanity; they joined insult to their cruelty; and their refusal, unworthy a people who had any respect for religion, and any love for their country, merited a more public chastisement; as otherwise their example might have proved contagious, and have defeated all the good effects of Gideon’s government.” <span class="ital">He slew the men of the city </span>— Not all of them; probably only those who had affronted him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:13-17 The active servants of the Lord meet with more dangerous opposition from false professors than from open enemies; but they must not care for the behaviour of those who are Israelites in name, but Midianites in heart. They must pursue the enemies of their souls, and of the cause of God, though they are ready to faint through inward conflicts and outward hardships. And they shall be enabled to persevere. The less men help, and the more they seek to hinder, the more will the Lord assist. Gideon's warning being slighted, the punishment was just.

All of them, especially those of them who had been most guilty, and had them to a proper place, where they might be made public examples of: <p>and thorns of the wilderness, and briers; which were near at hand, and soon cut up, for which he gave orders to proper persons: <p>and with them he taught the men of Succoth; either the inhabitants of the place, as distinct from the elders, whose punishment he taught them to be cautious not to follow such examples, or to behave ill to their superiors; or the princes and elders of the city are meant by the men of it, whom Gideon taught or chastised with thorns and briers; and so it is usual with us for a parent or master to say to his child or servant that has offended, I will "teach" you to do so or so, or to do otherwise, when he threatens to chastise: or "with them he made them to know" (z); that is, their sin and the heinousness of it, by the punishment he inflicted on them. Abarbinel thinks the word "know" has the signification of mercy in it, as in <a href="/exodus/2-25.htm">Exodus 2:25</a> in that he did not punish in general the men of that city, only the elders of it. The Targum is,"he broke upon them, or by them, the men of Succoth;''so Jarchi and others; that is, he broke the briers and thorns upon them, scourging them with them; or rather broke and tore their flesh by them: whether they died or no is not certain. <p>(z) "et cognoscere fecit", Montanus; so some in Vatablus; "notificavit", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">and with them he taught</span>] Read, changing one letter, <span class="bld">threshed</span> as in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/8-7.htm" title="And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.">Jdg 8:7</a></span>, with LXX.

Peshitto and Targ. paraphrase. The meaning seems to be that Gideon dragged thorns and teasels over their prostrate bodies, i.e. carded them; a form of torture well known in antiquity. For ‘threshing’ in this metaphorical sense cf. <a href="/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a>, <a href="/micah/4-13.htm" title="Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass: and you shall beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain to the LORD, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.">Micah 4:13</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm" title="Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.">Isaiah 41:15</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He taught</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> corrected, punished.

We have then the fulfilment of Gideon's threat in ver. 7 recorded in the same words with regard to Succoth, just as the <span class="accented">breaking down</span> of the tower of Penuel in ver. 17 is in verbal agreement with ver. 9. The Septuagint and Vulgate both seem to have found <span class="accented">he threshed</span> in their copies. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Midianitish kings were at Karkor with all the remnant of their army, about fifteen thousand men, a hundred and twenty thousand having already fallen. Gideon followed them thither by the road of the dwellers in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbeha; and falling upon them unawares, smote the whole camp, which thought itself quite secure, and took the two kings prisoners, after discomfiting all the camp. The situation of Karkor, which is only mentioned here, cannot be determined with certainty. The statement of Eusebius and Jerome (Onom. s. v. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;, Carcar), that it was the castle of Carcaria, a day's journey from Petra, is decidedly wrong, since this castle is much too far to the south, as Gesenius (Thes. p. 1210) has shown. Karkor cannot have been very far from Nobah and Jogbeha. These two places are probably preserved in the ruins of Nowakis and Jebeiha, on the north-west of Ammn (Rabbath-ammon; see at <a href="/numbers/21-31.htm">Numbers 21:31</a>). Now, as Burckhardt (Syr. p. 612) also mentions a ruin in the neighbourhood, called Karkagheisch, on the left of the road from Szalt to Ammn, and at the most an hour and a half to the north-west of Ammn, Knobel (on <a href="/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>) is inclined to regard this ruin as Karkor. If this supposition could be proved to be correct, Gideon would have fallen upon the camp of the enemy from the north-east. For "the way of the dwellers in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbeha" cannot well be any other than the way which ran to the east of Nobah and Jogbeha, past the most easterly frontier city of the Gadites, to the nomads who dwelt in the desert. &#1489;&#1488;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; has the article attached to the governing noun, which may easily be explained in this instance from the intervening preposition. The passive participle &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; has an intransitive force (see Ewald, 149, a.). The verb &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; in the circumstantial clause acquires the force of the pluperfect from the context. When he had startled the camp out of its security, having alarmed it by his unexpected attack, he succeeded in taking the two kings prisoners. </body></html>
