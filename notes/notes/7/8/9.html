It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Succoth was in the valley or Ghor of the Jordan <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5</a>, and Penuel apparently in the mountain.

And they did chide with him sharply," less from any dissatisfied longing for booty, than from injured pride or jealousy, because Gideon had made war upon the enemy and defeated them without the co-operation of this tribe, which was striving for the leadership. Gideon's reply especially suggests the idea of injured ambition: "What have I now done like you?" sc., as if I had done as great things as you. "Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?" The gleaning of Ephraim is the victory gained over the flying Midianites. Gideon declares this to be better than the vintage of Abiezer, i.e., the victory obtained by him the Abiezrite with his 300 men, because the Ephraimites had slain two Midianitish princes. The victory gained by the Ephraimites must indeed have been a very important one, as it is mentioned by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>) as a great blow of the Lord upon Midian. "And what could I do like you?" i.e., could I accomplish such great deeds as you? "Then their anger turned away from him." &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, the breathing of the nose, snorting, hence "anger," as in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>, etc. </body></html>
