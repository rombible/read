No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself, which belongs only to God. Gideon thought to keep up the remembrance of this victory by an ephod, made of the choicest of the spoils. But probably this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to it, and Gideon intended this for an oracle to be consulted. Many are led into false ways by one false step of a good man. It became a snare to Gideon himself, and it proved the ruin of the family.

But Gideon knew too well, and revered too piously the principles of the theocracy, to entertain the proposal for a moment. Personal and family ambition was cheerfully sacrificed to a sense of duty, and every worldly motive was kept in check by a supreme regard to the divine honor. He would willingly act as judge, but the Lord alone was King of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Rule thou over us; </span> not as a judge, for that he was already made by God; but as a king; and let the kingdom be hereditary to thee and to thy family.

Some time after his return, the chief men of Israel having met in a body, and consulted matters among themselves, sent a deputation to Gideon with an offer of the government of them: <p>rule thou over us, both thou and thy son, and thy son's son also; by which they meant, that he would take the kingly government of them, and which they proposed to settle in his posterity for ages to come; for, as a judge in Israel, he had a sort of rule and government of them under God already, but amounted not to regal power and authority; and this was what the people of Israel were fond of, that they might be like their neighbours; and this they tempted Gideon with, who had done such very wonderful and extraordinary things for them, which they allege as a reason: <p>for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian; from the bondage they were in to them, and therefore fit to be a king over them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</span><p>(m) That is, thy posterity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>22–28. <span class="ital">Gideon refuses the kingship: he sets up an ephod: conclusion<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span><span class="bld">22</span><span class="ital">.</span> <span class="ital">the men of Israel</span>] Not the 300 of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/judges/8-4.htm" title="And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them....">Jdg 8:4-21</a></span>, but the men who formed the army <a href="/judges/7-14.htm" title="And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host.">Jdg 7:14</a>, <a href="/judges/9-55.htm" title="And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.">Jdg 9:55</a>, the Israelites drawn from Ephraim, Manasseh, and the neighbouring tribes <a href="/judges/7-23.htm" title="And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.">Jdg 7:23</a>.

But the time predicted by Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14, 15</a>) was not yet come. And so Gideon returned an answer replete with moderation and piety: "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you" (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Gideon then reproached the elders with the insult they had offered him (<a href="/judges/8-6.htm">Judges 8:6</a>), and had them punished with desert thorns and thistles.
