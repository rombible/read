If so, it implies that he came round by some other road to attack Succoth. The word for “going up” is <span class= "ital">maaleh, </span>as in <span class= "ital">Maaleh Ahrabbim, </span>“the ascent of scorpions” (see Note on <a href="/judges/1-36.htm" title="And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.">Judges 1:36</a>), which is also applied to sunrise.

It cannot possibly mean “before <span class= "ital">sunset</span>” (<span class= "ital">ehe die Sonne heraufgekommen war</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as Luther renders it, following the Chaldee and various Rabbis. The ordinary word for “sun” is <span class= "ital">shemesh, </span>not <span class= "ital">cheres; </span>but the latter word occurs in various names (see on <a href="/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Judges 1:35</a>; <a href="/judges/2-9.htm" title="And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.">Judges 2:9</a>), which makes it perhaps more probable that this also is the name of some place. It might, indeed, be prudent for Gideon to desist from further pursuit when the dawn revealed the paucity and exhaustion of his followers; and in poetic style (<a href="/job/9-7.htm" title="Which commands the sun, and it rises not; and seals up the stars.">Job 9:7</a>) <span class= "ital">cheres </span>may mean “sun,” so that here the phrase <span class= "ital">might </span>be an archaism, as <span class= "ital">cheresah </span>is in <a href="/judges/14-18.htm" title="And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.">Judges 14:18</a>; but the preposition used <span class= "ital">(min</span>) cannot mean “before.” Aquila renders it “from the ascent <span class= "ital">of the groves” </span>and Symmachus “of the <span class= "ital">mountains;” </span>but this is only due to a defective reading.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/8-13.htm" title="And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,">Jdg 8:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Gideon returned before the sun was up — </span>By which it may be gathered, that he came upon them in the night, which was most convenient for him who had so small a number with him, and most likely to terrify them by the remembrance of the last night’s sad work. It must be acknowledged, however, that different interpretations are given of this passage. The Seventy, the Syriac, and Arabic versions take <span class="greekheb">החרס</span>, <span class="ital">hechares, </span>here rendered <span class="ital">sun, </span>for the name of a place, in which they are followed by Houbigant, who translates the words, <span class="ital">By that place which is above Hares. </span>It is well known, however, that the word just quoted does properly mean the sun, and is so translated in other passages of Scripture, and the translating it so here both gives a more important sense to the passage, and is more agreeable to the context than the amendment proposed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:13-17 The active servants of the Lord meet with more dangerous opposition from false professors than from open enemies; but they must not care for the behaviour of those who are Israelites in name, but Midianites in heart.

The less men help, and the more they seek to hinder, the more will the Lord assist. Gideon's warning being slighted, the punishment was just.

To Penuel and Succoth, to chastise them for their ill treatment of him and his men: <p>before the sun was up; by which it appears that it was in the night that he fell upon the host at Karkor, which must be the night following; it could not be the same night in which he had defeated them in the valley of Jezreel; though Vatablus thinks this battle was begun and finished in one night; but there were, according to this history, so many things done after the first defeat, as sending messengers to Mount Ephraim and the Ephraimites, upon the taking the fords of Jordan, and bringing the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, expostulating with him, and his answer to them, and his stay at Succoth and Penuel; which make it more probable that the day following was spent in the pursuit, and that it was the night after that that the whole affair was finished; and before sunrise Gideon returned to Penuel and Succoth again; so Ben Gersom and Abarbinel; but according to the Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi, this phrase is to be rendered, "before the sunset", while it yet appeared, and was above the horizon; and so it must be in the daytime that he pursued the two kings and took them, and returned before sunset. Abendana observes the word for "sun" may be the name of a place, and so the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions call it the ascent of Ares or Heres; as if it was the name of the place from whence Gideon returned, so called in like manner as the ascent of Akrabbim, and the like. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> before the sun <i>was up</i>,</span><p>(i) Some read, the sun being yet high.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">from the ascent of Heres</span>] So LXX.

The word Ḥeres = ‘the sun’ lends itself to various experiments, which are to be seen in the Versions. The general sense of the verse seems to be that Gideon returned from the battle by some different way.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the sun was up</span>. There is a wonderful diversity in the renderings of this verse. Some of the old versions and Jewish Rabbis interpret it <span class="accented">before sunset.</span> Many of the best Jewish commentators, however, understand the phrase as the A.V. does - "Before the going up of the sun," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before sunrise; supposing Gideon's attack on the Midianitish camp to have been a night attack, and Succoth to have been so near to Karkor that he was able to reach it by sunrise. But others say that the word here rendered <span class="accented">sun</span> (<span class="accented">heres</span>) is only used in poetry, and that the word rendered up is never used of sunrise, but, as, in the phrase "the going up of Akrabbim" (<a href="/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>), of an ascent up a hill. They therefore take <span class="accented">heres</span> as a proper name, and translate "from the going up of Hems." Others again, by an almost imperceptible change in the last letter, read "the mountains" instead of <span class="accented">Heres.</span> But the A.V. may be well defended, and gives an excellent sense. In <a href="/judges/14-18.htm">Judges 14:18</a> the same word for the sun is used in the very similar phrase, "before the sun went down." In <a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a> the phrase, "the morning arose," has the verb from which the word here rendered <span class="accented">up</span> is derived; and a note of time here exactly suits the context. It marks the celerity of Gideon's move. ments that he was actually on his way back to Succoth at sunrise, after having routed the Midianites and taken their two kings prisoners. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Gideon threatened them, therefore, with severe chastisement in the event of a victorious return. "If Jehovah give Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will thresh your flesh (your body) with desert thorns and thistles." The verb &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, constructed with a double accusative (see Ewald, 283, _.), is used in a figurative sense: "to thresh," in other words, to punish severely.

The explanation "threshing machines with stones or flints underneath them," which was suggested by J. D. Michaelis and Celsius, and adopted by Gesenius, cannot be sustained.</body></html>
