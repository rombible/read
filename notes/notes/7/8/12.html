It is many a time the true Christian's case, fainting, and yet pursuing. The world knows but little of the persevering and successful struggle the real believer maintains with his sinful heart. But he betakes himself to that Divine strength, in the faith of which he began his conflict, and by the supply of which alone he can finish it in triumph.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zebah and Zalmunna seem to have fled nearly due east to Karkor, which was probably an enclosure of some kind (perhaps a walled sheepfold, compare <a href="/numbers/31-32.htm">Numbers 31:32</a> note). Its site is unknown; but it was near Nobah, in the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40</a>, and Jogbehah was in the tribe of Gad <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34-35</a>. Gideon, perhaps taking a circuit so as to come upon them from the east, fell suddenly upon them, apparently at night, surprised them, and smote them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them&#8212;A third conflict took place.

The two kings were the first to fly; Gideon contented himself with capturing them, and letting the rest break away in panic. He did not kill the kings at once; he had promised to shew them to Succoth and Penuel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He discomfited</span>. Rather, as in the margin, he terrified. Those who were not killed in the first onslaught, when "he smote the host," were so terrified that they fled without further resistance, and many probably escaped, as all Gideon's efforts were directed to the capture of the two kings. CHAPTER 8:13-21 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The princes of Succoth, however, showed so little sympathy and nationality of feeling, that instead of taking part of the attack upon the enemies of Israel, they even refused to supply bread to refresh their brethren of the western tribes who were exhausted with the pursuit of the foe. They said (the sing. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; may be explained on the ground that one spoke in the name of all: see Ewald, 319, a.), "Is the fist of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand (power), that we should give thine army bread?" In these words there is not only an expression of cowardice, or fear of the vengeance which the Midianites might take when they returned upon those who had supported Gideon and his host, but contempt of the small force which Gideon had, as if it were impossible for him to accomplish anything at all against the foe; and in this contempt they manifested their utter want of confidence in God.</body></html>
