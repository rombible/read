We have no mention of this slaughter before, and here the account of it is so short, that we can only form conjectures. It is evident, however, that these kings had slain Gideon’s brethren; but in what manner, and for what reason, we are not informed. They answered, <span class="ital">As thou art, so were they,</span> &c. — By this it appears that Gideon was of a goodly presence, carrying greatness and majesty in his aspect; and that kings in those days were wont to match only with graceful persons, by whom they might hope to have children like themselves. <span class="ital">Each one resembled the children of a king — </span>Not for their garb or outward splendour, but for the majesty of their looks.

As they confessed themselves guilty of murder, Gideon acted as the avenger of blood, being the next of kin to the persons slain. Little did they think to have heard of this so long after; but murder seldom goes unpunished in this life. Sins long forgotten by man, must be accounted for to God. What poor consolation in death from the hope of suffering less pain, and of dying with less disgrace than some others! yet many are more anxious on these accounts, than concerning the future judgment, and what will follow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What manner of men - literally, "Where are the men?" The sense, "what manner of men", is merely gathered from the tenor of the answer. Gideon doubtless knew that his brethren had been killed by Zebah and Zalmunna, and the desire of avenging their death was one motive for his impetuous pursuit and attack. His question was rather a taunt, a bitter reproach to his captives, preparing them for their fate. Zebah and Zalmunna, in their answer, did not give evidence against themselves. Their hope was by a flattering answer to soothe Gideon's wrath. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Not at Penuel or Succoth, but when he had brought them into the land of Canaan, and perhaps to his own city Ophrah: <p>what manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? Mount Tabor, to which these men had betaken and hid themselves, in some caves and dens there: see <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a> and these kings some little time before the battle had taken them, and slew them, of which it seems Gideon had notice; and some of his brethren being not to be found, he suspected they were the persons, and therefore asked this question: <p>and they answered, as thou art, so were they; very much like him in countenance and stature, stout, able bodied men, of a graceful and majestic appearance. Abarbinel takes it to be a curse on Gideon, be thou, or thou shalt be, as they are; as they died by the hand of the Midianites, so shalt thou; but the former sense seems best, and agrees with what follows: <p>each one resembled the children of a king; being brought up in a delicate manner, as these persons seemed to have been: according to Jarchi and Kimchi, the sense is, they were like him, and had all one and the same form and lovely aspect, resembling kings' children; but according to Ben Gersom they were in general very much like Gideon, and one of them was like his children, who were then present, particularly his eldest son, as appears from <a href="/judges/8-20.htm">Judges 8:20</a>.

We may observe in passing how characteristic this is of a true narrative in which every. thing that happened cannot possibly be related (see <a href="/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11, 12</a>, note). The word here rendered <span class="accented">what manner of</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. of what</span> sort, means, in every other place in which it occurs, where? and the sense <span class="accented">of what sort is</span> only inferred from the answer, <span class="accented">As thou art</span>, <span class="accented">so were they.</span> But it is not safe thus to change the universal meaning of a common word. It is better to take the words of Gideon, <span class="accented">Where are the men whom ye slew</span> at Tabor? as an upbraiding of them for the murder of his brethren, and a threat that where they were their murderers would soon be. The answer of Zebah and Zalmunna, which is not given in its entirety, was no doubt intended to be soothing and deprecatory of Gideon's wrath. They pleaded the necessity they were under in self-defence to slay them; they were men of such royal stature and prowess that their own lives would have been in danger had they spared them. But Gideon turned a deaf ear to their plea. He must avenge the death of his own brothers, his own mother's sons. He would have spared them as prisoners of war (<a href="/2_kings/6-22.htm">2 Kings 6:22</a>), but he must do his part as <span class="accented">goel</span> or <span class="accented">avenger</span> (<a href="/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Observe the stress laid on their being not merely his father's sons by another wife, but his own mother's sons, a much more tender relation (cf. Psalm 50:0). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Midianitish kings were at Karkor with all the remnant of their army, about fifteen thousand men, a hundred and twenty thousand having already fallen. Gideon followed them thither by the road of the dwellers in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbeha; and falling upon them unawares, smote the whole camp, which thought itself quite secure, and took the two kings prisoners, after discomfiting all the camp. The situation of Karkor, which is only mentioned here, cannot be determined with certainty. The statement of Eusebius and Jerome (Onom. s. v. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#768;, Carcar), that it was the castle of Carcaria, a day's journey from Petra, is decidedly wrong, since this castle is much too far to the south, as Gesenius (Thes. p. 1210) has shown. Karkor cannot have been very far from Nobah and Jogbeha. These two places are probably preserved in the ruins of Nowakis and Jebeiha, on the north-west of Ammn (Rabbath-ammon; see at <a href="/numbers/21-31.htm">Numbers 21:31</a>). Now, as Burckhardt (Syr. p. 612) also mentions a ruin in the neighbourhood, called Karkagheisch, on the left of the road from Szalt to Ammn, and at the most an hour and a half to the north-west of Ammn, Knobel (on <a href="/numbers/32-42.htm">Numbers 32:42</a>) is inclined to regard this ruin as Karkor. If this supposition could be proved to be correct, Gideon would have fallen upon the camp of the enemy from the north-east. For "the way of the dwellers in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbeha" cannot well be any other than the way which ran to the east of Nobah and Jogbeha, past the most easterly frontier city of the Gadites, to the nomads who dwelt in the desert. &#1489;&#1488;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; has the article attached to the governing noun, which may easily be explained in this instance from the intervening preposition. The passive participle &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; has an intransitive force (see Ewald, 149, a.). The verb &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; in the circumstantial clause acquires the force of the pluperfect from the context. When he had startled the camp out of its security, having alarmed it by his unexpected attack, he succeeded in taking the two kings prisoners. </body></html>
