This is not a common application of the word father in the Old Testament. The prominent idea seems to be one of honour, combined with authority to teach and advise. It is applied to prophets (<a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), and to Joseph (<a href="/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>). The idea is implied in the converse phrase of <span class="accented">son</span>, applied to those to whom the prophets stood in 'the relation of spiritual fathers (see <a href="/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10, 20</a>, and frequently elsewhere). The abuse of the feeling which dictates the term as applied to human teachers is reproved by our Lord (<a href="/matthew/23-9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>). It has been freely used in the Christian Church, as in the titles <span class="accented">papa</span> or <span class="accented">pope</span> applied to bishops, <span class="accented">abbot</span> and <span class="accented">abbas</span>, <span class="accented">father in God</span>, <span class="accented">fathers of the Church</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> Here there is perhaps a special reference to the function of Micah's priest to ask counsel of God, and then give that counsel to those who came to inquire (see note to ver. 5). It may be added that the idea of <span class="accented">counsellor</span> seems to be inherent in the word cohen or <span class="accented">priest</span>, as in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Ten shekels</span> - a little over a pound of our money, but probably equivalent to &pound;20, when considered relatively to articles of consumption. <span class="cmt_word">A suit of apparel</span>. There is great doubt as to the exact meaning of the word rendered <span class="accented">suit</span> in this connection. The word means anything <span class="accented">arranged</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> put in a <span class="accented">rank</span>, or <span class="accented">row</span>, or <span class="accented">order.</span> In <a href="/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a> it is applied to the shewbread: "He ordered the bread in order." Thence it came to mean the <span class="accented">estimation</span> or <span class="accented">worth</span> of a person or thing - some-what as we use the word <span class="accented">rank.</span> From this last sense some interpret the word here to mean the <span class="accented">worth</span> or <span class="accented">price</span> of his clothes. Others, including St. Jerome and the Septuagint, interpret it <span class="accented">a pair</span> of vestments, meaning summer and winter clothing. But perhaps the A.V., <span class="accented">suit</span>, meaning the whole set of under and upper garments, is after all the best interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">The Levite went in</span>. The Hebrew is <span class="accented">went</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the common use of the word, <span class="accented">went his way.</span> And such is probably the meaning here. He went his way to consider the proposal made to him. The result is given in the next verse: <span class="accented">And the Levite was content</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hereupon-namely, when her son had given her back the silver ("he restored the silver unto his mother" is only a repetition of <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3</a>, introduced as a link with which to connect the appropriation of the silver)-the mother took 200 shekels and gave them to the goldsmith, who made an image and molten work of them, which were henceforth in Micah's house. The 200 shekels were not quite the fifth part of the whole. What she did with the rest is not stated; but from the fact that she dedicated the silver generally, i.e., the whole amount, to Jehovah, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3</a>, we may infer that she applied the remainder to the maintenance of the image-worship.<p>(Note: There is no foundation for Bertheau's opinion, that the 200 shekels were no part of the 1100, but the trespass-money paid by the son when he gave his mother back the money that he had purloined, since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, when a thief restored to the owner any stolen property, he was to add the fifth of its value. There is no ground for applying this law to the case before us, simply because the taking of the money by the son is not even described as a theft, whilst the mother really praises her son for his open confession.)<p>Pesel and massecah (image and molten work) are joined together, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>. The difference between the two words in this instance is very difficult to determine. Pesel signifies an idolatrous image, whether made of wood or metal. Massecah, on the other hand, signifies a cast, something poured; and when used in the singular, is almost exclusively restricted to the calf cast by Aaron or Jeroboam. It is generally connected with &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;, but it is used in the same sense without this definition (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12</a>). This makes the conjecture a very natural one, that the two words together might simply denote a likeness of Jehovah, and, judging from the occurrence at Sinai, a representation of Jehovah in the form of a molten calf. But there is one obstacle in the way of such a conjecture, namely, that in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-17.htm">Judges 18:17-18</a>, massecah is separated from pesel, so as necessarily to suggest the idea of two distinct objects. But as we can hardly suppose that Micah's mother had two images of Jehovah made, and that Micah had both of them set up in his house of God, no other explanation seems possible than that the massecah was something belonging to the pesel, or image of Jehovah, but yet distinct from it-in other words, that it was the pedestal upon which it stood. The pesel was at any rate the principal thing, as we may clearly infer from the fact that it is placed in the front rank among the four objects of Micah's sanctuary, which the Danites took with them (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-17.htm">Judges 18:17-18</a>), and that in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>, the pesel alone is mentioned in connection with the setting up of the image-worship in Dan. Moreover, there can hardly be any doubt that pesel, as a representation of Jehovah, was an image of a bull, like the golden calf which Aaron had made at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>), and the golden calves which Jeroboam set up in the kingdom of Israel, and one of which was set up in Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>).</body></html>
