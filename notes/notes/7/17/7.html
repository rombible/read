This <span class="ital">young man</span>, a Levite of Judah, was settled in the place where Micah lived, became intimate with him (<span class="ital"><a href="/judges/17-11.htm" title="And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.">Jdg 17:11</a></span> b), and was installed as his domestic priest (<span class="ital"><a href="/judges/17-12.htm" title="And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.">Jdg 17:12</a></span> a); we hear of <span class="ital">the young man</span> again in <a href="/judges/18-3.htm" title="When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought you here? and what make you in this place? and what have you here?">Jdg 18:3</a>; <a href="/judges/18-15.htm" title="And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and saluted him.">Jdg 18:15</a>.

The memory of a connexion between certain Levitical families and the southern clans has been preserved by the genealogies: thus among the Levitical families mentioned in <a href="/numbers/26-58.htm" title="These are the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korathites. And Kohath begat Amram.">Numbers 26:58</a>, the Libnites, Hebronites, Korahites are named after places in the territory of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-42.htm" title="Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,">Joshua 15:42</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-13.htm" title="Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/2-43.htm" title="And the sons of Hebron; Korah, and Tappuah, and Rekem, and Shema.">1 Chronicles 2:43</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How could <span class="ital">the young man</span> have belonged to the family of Judah and at the same time have been a Levite? (<span class="ital">a</span>) Wellhausen and Moore think that at this period <span class="ital">Levite</span> was the designation not of a tribe, but of a priestly caste open to any one1[61]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[61] So Driver, <span class="ital">Exodus</span>, p. 29, in agreement with McNeile, <span class="ital">Exodus</span>, p. lxvi. f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>. The young man is described as a Judaean by birth and a Levite by profession; for ‘in early times it was not the pedigree, but the art, that was the essential thing’ (Moore). The old tribe of Levi had been broken up (see Genesis 34; <a href="/context/genesis/49-5.htm" title="Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations....">Genesis 49:5-7</a>); the scattered members of it followed the priestly calling; out of this nucleus a priestly ‘tribe’ of Levi was created by a genealogical fiction. (<span class="ital">b</span>) There may be some error in the text. The LXX. cod. B omits the first <span class="ital">Judah</span>; the Peshitto omits <span class="ital">of the family of Judah</span>, merely, no doubt, because the description seemed unintelligible Budde, however, suggests that the text has deliberately been altered: originally it ran <span class="ital">of the family of Moses</span>, and this was afterwards modified out of respect for the traditional founder of the priesthood. A certain amount of support for such an alteration is given by <a href="/judges/18-30.htm" title="And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.">Jdg 18:30</a>; but <span class="ital">Judah</span> is hardly the name which would obviously occur as a substitute for <span class="ital">Moses</span>. It seems best after all to take the text as it stands, and to suppose that there was a time when ‘Levite’ was the official title of one who had received the training of a priest, regardless of the tribe to which he belonged by birth (McNeile). The evidence suggests that the scattered members of the tribe of Levi, like those of Simeon, had attached themselves to the Judaean settlements. The break up of these two tribes is accounted for in Genesis 34; <a href="/context/genesis/49-5.htm" title="Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations....">Genesis 49:5-7</a>, which refer to an episode apparently in the early days of the occupation of Canaan, and therefore not far removed in date from the present narrative. How the Levi of this ugly story came to be the priestly tribe is one of the obscure problems of Hebrew history; see <span class="ital">HDB</span>. s.v. Levi. Judah is here a <span class="ital">family</span>, the term applied to the small clan of the Danites (<a href="/judges/13-2.htm" title="And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.">Jdg 13:2</a> <span class="ital">n.</span>). It was not till later, probably not before the time of David, that the <span class="ital">family</span> of Judah grew into <span class="ital">the tribe</span>; Beth-lehem and the neighbourhood was most likely its ancient seat.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of the family of Judah</span>. These words are difficult to explain. If the man was a Levite he could not be of the family or tribe of Judah. Some explain the words to be merely a more accurate definition of Bethlehem-judah, as if he would say, I <span class="accented">mean Bethlehem in the tribe of Judah.</span> Others explain them to mean that he was one of a family of Levites who had settled in Bethlehem, and so came to be reckoned in civil matters as belonging to Judah. Others, that he was of the family of Judah on his mother s side, which might be the cause of his settling at Bethlehem. But many commentators think them spurious, as they are not found in the Septuagint (Cod. Vat.), nor in the Peschito, nor in No. 440 of De Rossi's MSS.

Bible), had stolen 1100 shekels of silver (about 135) from his mother. This is very apparent from the words which he spoke to his mother (v. 2): "The thousand and hundred shekels of silver which were taken from thee (the singular &#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; refers to the silver), about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears (i.e., didst so utter the curse that among others I also heard it), behold, this silver is with me; I have taken it." &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, to swear, used to denote a malediction or curse (cf. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). He seems to have been impelled to make this confession by the fear of his mother's curse. But his mother praised him for it, - "Blessed be my son of Jehovah," - partly because she saw in it a proof that there still existed a germ of the fear of God, but in all probability chiefly because she was about to dedicate the silver to Jehovah; for, when her son had given it back to her, she said (v. 3), "I have sanctified the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son, to make an image and molten work." The perfect &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not to be taken in the sense of the pluperfect, "I had sanctified it," but is expressive of an act just performed: I have sanctified it, I declare herewith that I do sanctify it. "And now I give it back to thee," namely, to appropriate to thy house of God.</body></html>
