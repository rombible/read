Satan ruins men by flattering them into a good opinion of their own safety, and so bringing them to mind nothing, and fear nothing; and then he robs them of their strength and honour, and leads them captive at his will. When we sleep our spiritual enemies do not. Samson's eyes were the inlets of his sin, (ver. 1,) and now his punishment began there. Now the Philistines blinded him, he had time to remember how his own lust had before blinded him. The best way to preserve the eyes, is, to turn them away from beholding vanity.

And she drove it in with the plug." These words are difficult to explain, partly because several technical terms are used which have more than one meaning, and partly because the account itself is contracted, both Samson's advice and her fulfilment of it being only given in a partial form, so that the one has to be completed from the other. In <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-19.htm">Judges 16:19</a>, the only other passage in which &#1502;&#1495;&#1500;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; occurs, it no doubt means the plaits into which Samson's long flowing hair was plaited. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; only occurs here (<a href="/judges/16-13.htm">Judges 16:13</a> and <a href="/judges/16-14.htm">Judges 16:14</a>), and probably means the woven cloth, or rather what was still upon the loom, the warp of the cloth, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (lxx). Accordingly the meaning of the verse would be this: If thou weavest the seven plaits of my hair along with the warp upon the loom. The commentators are all agreed that, according to these words, there must be something wanting in the account, though they are not of one opinion as to whether the binding of Samson is fully given here, and all that has to be supplied is the clause "Then shall I be weal," etc. (as in <a href="/judges/16-7.htm">Judges 16:7</a> and <a href="/judges/16-11.htm">Judges 16:11</a>), or whether the words &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1491; &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511;&#1506; add another fact which was necessary to the completeness of the binding, and if so, how these words are to be understood. In Bertheau's opinion, the words "and she thrust with the plug" probably mean nothing more than that she made a noise to wake the sleeping Samson, because it is neither stated here that she forced the plug into the wall or into the earth to fasten the plaits with (lxx, Jerome), nor that her thrusting with the plug contributed in any way to the further fastening of the hair. These arguments are sound no doubt, but they do not prove what is intended. When it is stated in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-14.htm">Judges 16:14</a>, that "he tore out the weaver's plug and the cloth," it is certainly evident that the plug served to fasten the hair to the cloth or to the loom. Moreover, not only would any knocking with the plug to waken Samson with the noise have been altogether superfluous, as the loud cry, "Philistines upon thee, Samson," would be amply sufficient for this; but it is extremely improbable that a fact with so little bearing upon the main facts would be introduced here at all. We come therefore to the same conclusion as the majority of commentators, viz., that the words in question are to be understood as referring to something that was done to fasten Samson still more securely. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1491;  equals  &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1490; &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1491; (<a href="/judges/16-14.htm">Judges 16:14</a>) does not mean the roller or weaver's beam, to which the threads of the warp were fastened, and round which the cloth was rolled when finished, as Bertheau supposes, for this is called &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512; in <a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>; nor the &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; of the Greeks, a flat piece of wood like a knife, which was used in the upright loom for the same purpose as our comb or press, viz., to press the weft together, and so increase the substance of the cloth (Braun, de vestitu Sacerd. p. 253); but the comb or press itself which was fastened to the loom, so that it could only be torn out by force. To complete the account, therefore, we must supply between <a href="/judges/16-13.htm">Judges 16:13</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-14.htm">Judges 16:14</a>, "And if thou fastenest it (the woven cloth) with the plug (the weaver's comb), I shall be weak like one of the other men; and she wove the seven plaits of his hair into the warp of the loom." Then follows in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16-14.htm">Judges 16:14</a>, "and fastened the cloth with the weaver's comb." There is no need, however, to assume that what has to be supplied fell out in copying. We have simply an ellipsis, such as we often meet with. When Samson as wakened out of his sleep by the cry of "Philistines upon thee," he tore out the weaver's comb and the warp (sc.,) from the loom, with his plaits of hair that had been woven in. The reference to his sleeping warrants the assumption that Delilah had also performed the other acts of binding while he was asleep. We must not understand the account, however, as implying that the three acts of binding followed close upon one another on the very same day. Several days may very probably have elapsed between them. In this third deception Samson had already gone so far in his presumptuous trifling with the divine gift entrusted to him, as to suffer the hair of his head to be meddled with, though it was sanctified to the Lord. "It would seem as though this act of sin ought to have brought him to reflection. But as that was not the case, there remained but one short step more to bring him to thorough treachery towards the Lord" (O. v. Gerlach).</body></html>
