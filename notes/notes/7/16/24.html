By the loss of his bodily sight the eyes of his understanding were opened; and by depriving him of bodily strength, the Lord was pleased to renew his spiritual strength. The Lord permits some few to wander wide and sink deep, yet he recovers them at last, and marking his displeasure at sin in their severe temporal sufferings, preserves them from sinking into the pit of destruction. Hypocrites may abuse these examples, and infidels mock at them, but true Christians will thereby be rendered more humble, watchful, and circumspect; more simple in their dependence on the Lord, more fervent in prayer to be kept from falling, and in praise for being preserved; and, if they fall, they will be kept from sinking into despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our God ... - A portion of the Philistine triumphal song.

Not on the occasion of his being brought into the temple as mentioned in ver. 25, but after his capture, and whenever they saw him grinding or elsewhere. It was this universal ascription of praise to Dagon that led to the celebration of this great feast. This praise of Dagon is also dwelt upon to show that God, in what happened, vindicated the glory of his own great name, which was blasphemed by the servants of Dagon when they thus made him superior to Jehovah. So Milton makes Samson say, "All the contest is now 'Twixt God and Dagon .... He, be sure, will not connive or linger, thus provoked, but will arise, and his great name assert." Generally, the 'Samson Agonistes' is an excellent commentary on the history of Samson. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Delilah saw (i.e., perceived, namely from his words and his whole behaviour while making this communication) that he had betrayed the secret of his strength, she had the princes of the Philistines called: "Come up this time, ... for he had revealed to her all his heart." This last clause is not to be understood as having been spoken by Delilah to the princes themselves, as it is by the Masorites and most of the commentators, in which case &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; would have to be altered into &#1500;&#1497;; but it contains a remark of the writer, introduced as an explanation of the circumstance that Delilah sent for the princes of the Philistines now that she was sure of her purpose. This view is confirmed by the word &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (came up) which follows, since the use of the perfect instead of the imperfect with vav consec. can only be explained on the supposition that the previous clause is a parenthetical one, which interrupts the course of the narrative, and to which the account of the further progress of the affair could not be attached by the historical tense (&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;).<p>(Note: The Keri reading &#1500;&#1497; arose simply from a misunderstanding, although it is found in many MSS and early editions, and is without any critical worth. The Masorites overlooked the fact that the main point is all that is related of the message of Delilah to the princes of the Philistines, namely that they were to come this time, and that the rest can easily be supplied from the context. Studer admits how little &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; suits that view of the clause which the Keri reading &#1500;&#1497; requires, and calls it "syntactically impossible." He proposes, however, to read &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, without reflecting that this reading is also nothing more than a change which is rendered necessary by the alteration of &#1500;&#1492;&#1468; into &#1500;&#1497;, and has no critical value.)<p>The princes of the Philistines came up to Delilah on the receipt of this communication, bringing the money, the promised reward of her treachery (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), in their hands.</body></html>
