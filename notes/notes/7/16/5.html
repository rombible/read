The reason of it is unknown. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The pursuit of the Philistines, however, and the conflict with them, had exhausted Samson, so that he was very thirsty, and feared that he might die from exhaustion; for it was about the time of the wheat-harvest (<a href="/judges/15-1.htm">Judges 15:1</a>), and therefore hot summer weather. Then he called to the Lord, "Thou hast through (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;) "Thy servant given this great deliverance; and now I shall die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised!" From this prayer we may see that Samson was fully conscious that he was fighting for the cause of the Lord. And the Lord helped him out of this trouble. God split the hollow place at Lechi, so that water came out of it, as at Horeb and Kadesh (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/20-8.htm">Numbers 20:8</a>, <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>). The word &#1502;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, which is used in <a href="/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a> to signify a mortar, is explained by rabbinical expositors as denoting the socket of the teeth, or the hollow place in which the teeth are fixed, like the Greek &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, mortariolum, according to Pollux, Onom. ii. c. 4, 21. Accordingly many have understood the statement made here, as meaning that God caused a fountain to flow miraculously out of the socket of a tooth in the jaw-bone which Samson had thrown away, and thus provided for his thirst. This view is the one upon which Luther's rendering, "God split a tooth in the jaw, so that water came out," is founded, and is has been voluminously defended by Bochart (Hieroz. l. ii. c. 15). But the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "the maktesh which is at Lechi," is opposed to this view, since the tooth-socket in the jaw-bone of the ass would be simply called &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1502;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1502;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;; and so is also the remark that this fountain was still in existence in the historian's own time. And the article proves nothing to the contrary, as many proper names are written with it (see Ewald, 277, c.). Consequently we must follow Josephus (Ant. v. 8), who takes &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; as the name given to the opening of the rock, which was cleft by God to let water flow out. "If a rocky precipice bore the name of jaw-bone (lechi) on account of its shape, it was a natural consequence of this figurative epithet, that the name tooth-hollow should be given to a hole or gap in the rock" (Studer). Moreover, the same name, Maktesh, occurs again in <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>, where it is applied to a locality in or near Jerusalem. The hollow place was split by Elohim, although it was to Jehovah that Samson had prayed, to indicate that the miracle was wrought by God as the Creator and Lord of nature. Samson drank, and his spirit returned, so that he revived again. Hence the fountain received the name of En-hakkore, "the crier's well which is at Lechi," unto this day. According to the accents, the last clause does not belong to &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; (in Lechi), but to &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; (he called, etc.). It received the name given to it unto this day. This implies, of course, that the spring itself was in existence when our book was composed. - In <a href="/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20</a> the account of the judicial labours of Samson are brought to a close, with the remark that Samson judged Israel in the days of the Philistines, i.e., during their rule, for twenty years. What more is recorded of him in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/16.htm">Judges 16</a> relates to his fall and ruin; and although even in this he avenged himself upon the Philistines, he procured no further deliverance for Israel. It is impossible to draw any critical conclusions from the position in which this remark occurs, as to a plurality of sources for the history of Samson. </body></html>
