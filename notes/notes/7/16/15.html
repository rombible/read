Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls.

But Samson, when he awoke, tore up the pin from its socket, and went away with the loom and the pin fastened to his hair.<p>The beam - Rather, the "loom," or "frame."
