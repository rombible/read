Licentiousness is one of the things that take away the heart. This is a deep pit into which many have fallen; but from which few have escaped, and those by a miracle of mercy, with the loss of reputation and usefulness, of almost all, except their souls.

After this successful act, Samson gave himself up once more to his sensual lusts. He fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, named Delilah (i.e., the weak or pining one), to whose snares he eventually succumbed. With reference to the valley of Sorek, Eusebius affirms in the Onom. (s. v. &#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7;), that there was a village called &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7; (l. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c7; according to Jerome) near Zorea, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (l. &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; according to Jerome, who has ad septentrionalem plagam); and also (s. v. &#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;) that this place was near to Eshtaol. Consequently the Sorek valley would have to be sought for somewhere in the neighbourhood of Samson's birthplace (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>), and the dwelling-place of his family (<a href="/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a>).</body></html>
