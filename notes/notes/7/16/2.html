In this chapter we find him behaving in so wicked a manner, that many question whether or not he were a godly man. But the apostle has determined this, Heb 11:32. By adverting to the doctrines and examples of Scripture, the artifices of Satan, the deceitfulness of the human heart, and the methods in which the Lord frequently deals with his people, we may learn useful lessons from this history, at which some needlessly stumble, while others cavil and object. The peculiar time in which Samson lived may account for many things, which, if done in our time, and without the special appointment of Heaven, would be highly criminal. And there might have been in him many exercises of piety, which, if recorded, would have reflected a different light upon his character. Observe Samson's danger. Oh that all who indulge their sensual appetites in drunkenness, or any fleshly lusts, would see themselves thus surrounded, way-laid, and marked for ruin by their spiritual enemies! The faster they sleep, the more secure they feel, the greater their danger. We hope it was with a pious resolution not to return to his sin, that he rose under a fear of the danger he was in. Can I be safe under this guilt? It was bad that he lay down without such checks; but it would have been worse, if he had laid still under them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gaza - About 8 hours from Eleutheropolis, and one of the chief strong-holds of the Philistines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>Jud 16:1-3. Samson Carries Away the Gates of Gaza.<p>1, 2. Gaza&#8212;now Guzzah, the capital of the largest of the five Philistine principal cities, about fifteen miles southwest of Ashkelon. The object of this visit to this city is not recorded, and unless he had gone in disguise, it was a perilous exposure of his life in one of the enemy's strongholds. It soon became known that he was there; and it was immediately resolved to secure him. But deeming themselves certain of their prey, the Gazites deferred the execution of their measure till the morning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This they chose to do, rather than to seize upon him in his house and bed by night; either because they knew not certainly in what house or place he was; or because they thought that might cause great terror, and confusion, and mischief among their own people; whereas in the day time they might more fully discover him, and more unexpectedly surprise him, and more certainly direct their blows and use their weapons against him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it was told the Gazites,....

These words have no doubt accidentally fallen out of the Hebrew text, but they are necessary to the sense, and are expressed in all the ancient versions. We have no clue as to the motive of Samson's visit to Gaza, whether he was meditating its conquest, or an assault upon its inhabitants, or whether he came merely in the wild spirit of adventure, or upon civil business. We only know that he came there, that, with his usual weakness, he fell into the snare of female blandishments, that the Philistines thought to have caught him and killed him, but that he escaped by his supernatural strength. Gaza is about thirteen hours' march from Thimnathah. <span class="cmt_word">They compassed him in</span>. The Hebrew does not express this idea, nor is it what the Gazites did. It should be rendered, <span class="accented">They went about and lay in wait for him.</span> Instead of attacking him directly, they took a round-about course, and set an ambush for him in the city gates, probably in the guard-room by the side of the gate, intending when he came forth unsuspectingly in the morning, at the hour of opening the gates, to rush upon him and kill him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As soon as he was relieved of his bands, he seized upon a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, which he found there, and smote therewith a thousand men. He himself commemorated this victory in a short poetical strain (<a href="/judges/15-16.htm">Judges 15:16</a>): "With the ass's jaw-bone a heap, two heaps; with the ass's jaw-bone I smote a thousand men." The form of the word &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;  equals  &#1495;&#1502;&#1512; is chosen on account of the resemblance to &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512;, and is found again at <a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>. How Samson achieved this victory is not minutely described. But the words "a heap, two heaps," point to the conclusion that it did not take place in one encounter, but in several. The supernatural strength with which Samson rent asunder the fetters bound upon him, when the Philistines thought they had him safely in their power, filled them with fear and awe as before a superior being, so that they fled, and he pursued them, smiting one heap after another, as he overtook them, with an ass's jaw-bone which he found in the way. The number given, viz., a thousand, is of course a round number signifying a very great multitude, and has been adopted from the song into the historical account.</body></html>
