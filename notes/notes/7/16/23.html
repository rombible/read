The Lord permits some few to wander wide and sink deep, yet he recovers them at last, and marking his displeasure at sin in their severe temporal sufferings, preserves them from sinking into the pit of destruction. Hypocrites may abuse these examples, and infidels mock at them, but true Christians will thereby be rendered more humble, watchful, and circumspect; more simple in their dependence on the Lord, more fervent in prayer to be kept from falling, and in praise for being preserved; and, if they fall, they will be kept from sinking into despair.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dagon was the national idol of the Philistines <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>, so called from Dag, a fish. The description of Dagon, in his temple at Ashdod <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-4.htm">1 Samuel 5:4</a>, exactly agrees with the representations of a fish-god on the walls of Khorsabad, on slabs at Kouyunjik, and on sundry antique cylinders and gems. In these the figures vary. Some have a human form down to the waist, with that of a fish below the waist; others have a human head, arms, and legs, growing, as it were, out of a fish's body, and so arranged that the fish's head forms a kind of mitre to the man's head, while the body and fins form a kind of cloak, hanging down behind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 16:23-25.

And this place being near Egypt, where some of their gods were worshipped in the form of fishes, and being near the sea, it seems most probable that it was one of the sea gods of the heathens, and that it had in some part the resemblance of a fish. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together,.... The five lords, with their friends, not directly upon Samson's being taken and committed to prison, but some time after; perhaps some months: <p>for to get a great sacrifice to Dagon their god; in later times their god was called Marnas (o), which signifies the lord of men, but now Dagon; who also had a temple at Ashdod, another of the five principalities of the Philistines, <a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2</a> and seems to have been at this time their common and chief deity: according to Jarchi in the place referred to, it was in the form of a fish, for "dag" in Hebrew signifies a fish; and Kimchi on the same place says, that from its navel upwards it was in the form of a man, and from thence downwards in the form of a fish (p); and Diodorus Siculus (q) relates that Derceto, a goddess of Ashkelon, another of the five principalities of Palestine, its face was human, and the other part of its body resembled a fish; and the same Lucian says of the Syrian goddess; and Cicero (r) testifies, that the Syrians worshipped a fish, and Porphyry (s) says they will not eat any; and Gaza being a maritime city, a sea port, this might be their sea god in this form: but Ben Gersom in the above place says, it was in the form of a man; and Sanchoniatho (t) making mention of Dagan, a brother of Saturn, Philo Byblius, who translated his history into Greek, interprets it by Siton, which signifies corn, deriving it from Dagan, which so signifies; as if this deity presided over corn, as Ceres in other nations, and Jupiter Frumentarius, or Aratrius; yea, he says he invented corn and the plough; however this be, the Philistine princes met together to sacrifice to him, not a common offering, but a great sacrifice. It is very probable that this was a public festival of the Philistines, as Josephus (u) says, an anniversary one; and perhaps was held in a more grand manner on the present occasion, since it is added: <p>and to rejoice: for they said, our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hands; for though Samson's harlot had done it, and they had paid her for it, yet they attribute it to their god, such was their blindness and stupidity; and yet this may shame us believers in the true God, who are so backward to ascribe to him the great things he does for us, when such Heathens were so forward to give glory to their false deities, without any foundation for it. <p>(o) Hicron. in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/17.htm">Isaiah 17</a>.fol. 39.

But the name also occurs outside the territory once held by the Philistines; it survives in <span class="ital">Beit-dejan</span> 7 m. E. of Nâblus; and we may infer that the worship of Dagon was not confined to the Philistines. Most likely he was a Canaanite god adopted by the Philistines when they settled in the country, just as they adopted Ashtoreth (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm" title="And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.">1 Samuel 31:10</a>). The name of the Canaanite letter-writer <span class="ital">Dagan-takala</span> in the Amarna tablets (Nos. 215, 216) carries us back to the age when Babylonian influences prevailed in Canaan; and Dagan is met with as the name of a deity from the early Babylonian down to the Assyrian period, both in proper names and in conjunction with Anu; the latter fact points to a god of heaven. But whether he was a native Babylonian god is not certain; it seems probable that he was introduced from outside, perhaps from Canaan; most authorities identify him with the Philistine Dagon2[58]. Of his nature nothing definite is known. Philo of Byblus derives the name from <span class="ital">dâgân</span> = <span class="ital">corn</span>, and regards him as an agricultural deity; Ḳimḥi (xiiith century a.d.) in his commentary on <a href="/1_samuel/5-4.htm" title="And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off on the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.">1 Samuel 5:4</a> mentions a tradition that Dagon’s image was shaped as a man above the waist and a fish below (<span class="ital">dâg</span> = <span class="ital">fish</span>). These, however, are only etymological guesses. It may be questioned whether the god, half man and half fish, represented on the coins of Ascalon and Arvad, was intended for Dagon3[59].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] One of these was probably the Bit-daganna mentioned in the Prism Inscr. of Sennacherib, <span class="ital">KB.</span> ii. 93.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] See Dhorme, <span class="ital">La Rel.

The fish was a natural emblem of fertility and productiveness, especially to a maritime people. The fish-shaped idol is found upon old Phoenician coins, and also on the monuments of Khorsabad, and on some Assyrian gems in the British Museum. One of the chief temples of Dagon was at Gaza.
