The Israelites blamed Samson for what he had done against the Philistines, as if he had done them a great injury. Thus our Lord Jesus did many good works, and for those the Jews were ready to stone him. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, his cords were loosed: where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and those are free indeed who are thus set free. Thus Christ triumphed over the powers of darkness that shouted against him, as if they had him in their power. Samson made great destruction among the Philistines. To take the bone of an ass for this, was to do wonders by the foolish things of the world, that the excellency of the power might be of God, not of man. This victory was not in the weapon, was not in the arm; but it was in the Spirit of God, which moved the weapon by the arm. We can do all things through Him that strengtheneth us. Seest thou a poor Christian, who is enabled to overcome a temptation by weak, feeble counsel, there is the Philistine vanquished by a sorry jaw-bone.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The dispirited men of Judah were prepared to give up their champion, in order to conciliate their masters.

Then the Philistines went up&#8212;to the high land of Judah.<p>and spread themselves in Lehi&#8212;now El-Lekieh, abounding with limestone cliffs; the sides of which are perforated with caves. The object of the Philistines in this expedition was to apprehend Samson, in revenge for the great slaughter he had committed on their people. With a view of freeing his own countrymen from all danger from the infuriated Philistines, he allowed himself to be bound and surrendered a fettered prisoner into their power. Exulting with joy at the near prospect of riddance from so formidable an enemy, they went to meet him. But he exerted his superhuman strength, and finding a new (or moist) jawbone of an ass, he laid hold of it, and with no other weapon, slew a thousand men at a place which he called Ramath-lehi&#8212;that is, "the hill of the jawbone."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. from the cave or hole in the rock, in which he had secured himself, out of which he was first brought up, and then carried down from the rock to the plain. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they spake unto him, saying, no,....
