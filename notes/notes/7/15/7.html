In the means which Samson employed, we must look at the power of God supplying them, and making them successful, to mortify the pride and punish the wickedness of the Philistines. The Philistines threatened Samson's wife that they would burn her and her father's house. She, to save herself and oblige her countrymen, betrayed her husband; and the very thing that she feared, and by sin sought to avoid, came upon her! She, and her father's house, were burnt with fire, and by her countrymen, whom she thought to oblige by the wrong she did to her husband.

Samson said &#8230;, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you&#8212;By that act the husbandmen had been the instruments in avenging his private and personal wrongs.

This is perhaps on the whole the most probable meaning. It still leaves it uncertain whether the Philistines meant to do Samson justice, or to do him an additional injury, by putting his wife and her father to death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Further Acts of Samson. - <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/15-1.htm">Judges 15:1-8</a>.
