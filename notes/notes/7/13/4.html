When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of such mothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept. Husbands and wives should tell each other their experiences of communion with God, and their improvements in acquaintance with him, that they may help each other in the way that is holy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Zorah - See the marginal reference.<p>His wife was barren - To mark more distinctly the high providential destiny of the child that was eventually born.

Any liquor inebriating and intoxicating, neither new wine nor old wine, as the Targum, and so Jarchi; the reason of this appears in the next verse, because the child she should conceive and bear was to be a Nazarite, and to be one from his mother's womb; and from all such liquors, Nazarites, according to the law, were to abstain, <a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>. <p>and eat not any unclean thing; meaning not so much such sort of food as was forbidden by the law to be eaten, which every Israelite was to abstain from, but such as were particularly forbidden to Nazarites, as moist and dried grapes, or anything made of the vine tree, from the kernel to the husk, <a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>. The reason of this is, because the child in the womb is nourished with the same the mother is; and as this child was to be a Nazarite from the womb, and even in it, his mother was to abstain both from eatables and drinkables forbidden a Nazarite by the law. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>.

The two prohibitions are classed together, apparently on the principle that to partake of anything fermented or putrified renders a person unfit for consecration to the Deity1[50]. Thus priests during their service were not allowed to drink wine (<a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm" title="Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:">Leviticus 10:9</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/44-21.htm" title="Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.">Ezekiel 44:21</a>); while unclean foods, i.e. carrion (<a href="/exodus/22-31.htm" title="And you shall be holy men to me: neither shall you eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs.">Exodus 22:31</a>, <a href="/leviticus/7-24.htm" title="And the fat of the beast that dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but you shall in no wise eat of it.">Leviticus 7:24</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm" title="You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it to the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to an alien: for you are an holy people to the LORD your God.

The restrictions are laid upon the mother; nothing is said about the child observing them. Samson did not consider himself bound to abstain from wine (see below); the second prohibition was not distinctive of the Nazirite consecration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[50] See Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Rel. of Sem.</span>, 203 f., 367, 465. Frazer, <span class="ital">Golden Bough</span> i. 183–185, suggests that the ultimate reason for abstinence from intoxicating wine was the idea that ‘whoever drinks wine drinks the blood, and so receives into himself the soul or spirit of the god of the vine.’ Such intercourse with a spirit alien to Jehovah would be regarded by a Hebrew as unlawful. The Nazirite abstinence from wine seems to have been determined by other reasons, as suggested above; when it came into practice the original meaning of the prohibition was lost.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He was followed by the judge Abdon, the son of Hillel of Pirathon.
