Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept.

At the beginning of the 12th century these ‘peoples of the sea’ swept down upon Upper Syria and S.W. Canaan; they were twice defeated by the Pharaoh, but he did not succeed in driving them all out of the country. The Philistines settled on the coast between Carmel and Gaza, and in course of time formed a federal state governed by five <span class="ital">lords</span> (<span class="ital">serânim</span>, <a href="/judges/3-3.htm" title="Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.">Jdg 3:3</a>, <a href="/judges/16-5.htm" title="And the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give you every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.">Jdg 16:5</a> ff., <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm" title="From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:">Joshua 13:3</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;">1 Samuel 6:17</a> f.); a kindred tribe, the Cherçthites (translated <span class="ital">Cretans</span>1[48] by LXX in <a href="/zephaniah/2-5.htm" title="Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy you, that there shall be no inhabitant.">Zephaniah 2:5</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/25-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.">Ezekiel 25:16</a>), found a home in the Negeb, <a href="/1_samuel/30-14.htm" title="We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.">1 Samuel 30:14</a>. At the period of the Samson story the Philistines not only held the maritime plain and the Shephçlah, but had made themselves masters of the inland districts belonging to the Israelites; in the period which follows they pushed their conquests further E. and N., and it was to resist these aggressions that the Hebrew monarchy was founded. The foreign origin of the Philistines is recognized by O.T. tradition. Thus in Judg. and Sam. they are called ‘the uncircumcised,’ and their original home is said to have been Caphtor (<a href="/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a> LXX Cappadocia, <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm" title="Because of the day that comes to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remains: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.">Jeremiah 47:4</a>, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm" title="And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>), which may be the equivalent of <span class="ital">Keftô</span>, the ancient Egyptian name for the western quarter of the world, especially perhaps Cilicia; the civilization which they brought with them no doubt belonged to the early Aegean type2[49]. But though foreigners by race and civilization, they seem to have adopted the language and religion of the natives whom they conquered. The names of persons and places in Philistia are Canaanite (except perhaps <span class="ital">Achish</span>, and <span class="ital">serânim</span> above); the gods whom they worshipped, Dagon (<a href="/judges/16-23.htm" title="Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.">Jdg 16:23</a> f., 1 Samuel 5), Ashtart (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm" title="And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.">1 Samuel 31:10</a>), Baal-zebub (<a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2 Kings 1:2</a> f.), are Canaanite too; see also Herod, i. 105. Curiously enough, the district inhabited by these foreign invaders (Hebr. <span class="ital">Pelesheth</span>) gave its name through Greek influence to the whole country, <span class="greekheb">Παλαιστίνη</span> (Herod. ii. 104, vii. 89), Palestine.

It by no means follows from this phrase that this chapter is in direct chronological sequence to the preceding The scene is shifted to the tribe of Dan, and to the Philistines on the west, and there is nothing to guide us as to the exact time when the things narrated occurred. But the end of the forty years probably coincided with the judgeship of Samuel; for there was no complete deliverance in the time of Samson, only occasional cheeks to the Philistine domination (see ver. 5). It was not till the days of Samuel that the Philistines were really smitten (see <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-14</a>). We may suppose the date of the ensuing narrative to be somewhere in the first decade of the Philistine oppression. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of these three judges no particular deeds are related, just as in the case of Tola and Jair (see the remarks on <a href="/judges/10-1.htm">Judges 10:1</a>). But it certainly follows from the expression &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/12-8.htm">Judges 12:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/12-11.htm">Judges 12:11</a>, <a href="/judges/12-13.htm">Judges 12:13</a>) that they were one after another successors of Jephthah, and therefore that their office of judge also extended simply over the tribes on the east of the Jordan, and perhaps the northern tribes on this side.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/judges/12-8.htm">Judges 12:8-10</a><p>Ibzan sprang from Bethlehem,-hardly, however, the town of that name in the tribe of Judah, as Josephus affirms (Ant. v. 7, 13), for that is generally distinguished either as Bethlehem "of Judah" (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>, <a href="/judges/17-9.htm">Judges 17:9</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-2.htm">Ruth 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>), or Bethlehem Ephratah (<a href="/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>), but probably Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15</a>). He had thirty sons and thirty daughters, the latter of whom he sent away &#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492; (out of his house), i.e., gave them in marriage, and brought home thirty women in their places from abroad as wives for his sons. He judged Israel seven years, and was buried in Bethlehem.</body></html>
