Good men are more careful and desirous to know the duty to be done by them, than to know the events concerning them: duty is ours, events are God's. God will guide those by his counsel, who desire to know their duty, and apply to him to teach them. Pious parents, especially, will beg Divine assistance. The angel repeats the directions he had before given. There is need of much care for the right ordering both of ourselves and our children, that we may be duly separate from the world, and living sacrifices to the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man of God - The designation of a prophet, of frequent use in the books of Samuel and Kings <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-8</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/9-10.htm">1 Samuel 9:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-5.htm">1 Kings 13:5-6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>, and applied to Timothy by Paul in the New Testament <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>.<p>His countenance - Rather, "his appearance," as the word is rendered in <a href="/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 13:11-14.

Mishpachath Dani (the family of the Danites) is used interchangeably with shebet Dani (the tribe of the Danites: see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>, <a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>), which may be explained on this ground, that according to <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-42.htm">Numbers 26:42-43</a>, all the Danites formed but one family, viz., the family of the Shuhamites. The angel of the Lord announced to this woman, who was barren, "Thou wilt conceive and bear a son. And now beware, drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean: for, behold, thou wilt conceive and bear a son, and no razor shall come upon his head; for a vowed man of God (Nazir) will the boy be from his mother's womb," i.e., his whole life long, "to the day of his death," as the angel expressly affirmed, according to <a href="/judges/13-7.htm">Judges 13:7</a>. The three prohibitions which the angel of the Lord imposed upon the woman were the three things which distinguished the condition of a Nazarite (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/6-1.htm">Numbers 6:1-8</a>, and the explanation given there of the Nazarite vow). The only other thing mentioned in the Mosaic law is the warning against defilement from contact with the dead, which does not seem to have been enforced in the case of Samson. When the angel added still further, "And he (the Nazarite) will begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines," he no doubt intended to show that his power to effect this deliverance would be closely connected with his condition as a Nazarite. The promised son was to be a Nazarite all his life long, because he was to begin to deliver Israel out of the power of his foes. And in order that he might be so, his mother was to share in the renunciations of the Nazarite vow during the time of her pregnancy. Whilst the appearance of the angel of the Lord contained the practical pledge that the Lord still acknowledged His people, though He had given them into the hands of their enemies; the message of the angel contained this lesson and warning for Israel, that it could only obtain deliverance from its foes by seeking after a life of consecration to the Lord, such as the Nazarites pursued, so as to realize the idea of the priestly character to which Israel had been called as the people of Jehovah, by abstinence from the deliciae carnis, and everything that was unclean, as being emanations of sin, and also by a complete self-surrender to the Lord (see Pentateuch, p. 674). </body></html>
