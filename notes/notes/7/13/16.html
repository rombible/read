God has in his word given full directions concerning our duty, but never designed to answer other questionings. There are secret things which belong not to us, of which we must be quite contented to be ignorant, while in this world. The name of our Lord is wonderful and secret; but by his wonderful works he makes himself known as far as is needful for us. Prayer is the ascent of the soul to God. But without Christ in the heart by faith, our services are offensive smoke; in him, acceptable flame. We may apply this to Christ's sacrifice of himself for us; he ascended in the flame of his own offering, for by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, Heb 9:12. In Manoah's reflections there is great fear; We shall surely die. In his wife's reflection there is great faith. As a help meet for him, she encouraged him. Let believers who have had communion with God in the word and prayer, to whom he has graciously manifested himself, and who have had reason to think God has accepted their works, take encouragement from thence in a cloudy and dark day. God would not have done what he has done for my soul, if he had designed to forsake me, and leave me to perish at last; for his work is perfect. Learn to reason as Manoah's wife; If God designed me to perish under his wrath, he would not give me tokens of his favour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The language of Manoah, like that of Gideon <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-18.htm">Judges 6:18</a>, seems to indicate some suspicion that his visitor was more than human. The word rendered "made ready," is also the proper word for "offering a sacrifice," and is so used by the Angel in the next verse. By which it appears that the Angel understood Manoah to speak of offering a kid as a burnt-offering. Hence, his caution, "thou must offer it unto the Lord." (Compare <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/10-25.htm">Acts 10:25-26</a>.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 13:15-23. Manoah's Sacrifice.<p>15. Manoah said unto the angel &#8230;, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid&#8212;The stranger declined the intended hospitality and intimated that if the meat were to be an offering, it must be presented to the Lord [Jud 13:6]. Manoah needed this instruction, for his purpose was to offer the prepared viands to him, not as the Lord, but as what he imagined him to be, not even an angel (Jud 13:16), but a prophet or merely human messenger. It was on this account, and not as rejecting divine honors, that he spoke in this manner to Manoah. The angel's language was exactly similar to that of our Lord (Mt 19:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Bread, </span> i.e. meat, as <span class="ital">bread</span> is commonly taken in Scripture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the Lord; </span> not unto a man, as now thou apprehendest me to be; but unto the Lord, as thou wilt by and by perceive me to be. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah,....

Gideon is allowed to prepare and cook a meal, but it is consumed by fire, not by the Angel; here the very notion of a meal is repelled (cf. <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/12-19.htm" title="All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.">Tob 12:19</a>); if anything is to be presented it must be a burnt offering, and offered to Jehovah.

The angel, perhaps perceiving that Manoah was in doubt as to who he might be, had a holy dread lest he might offer the kid to him, just as the angel whom St. John was about to worship said, "See thou do it not" (<a href="/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>); and Barnabas and Paul ran in among the people of Lycaonia to restrain them from offering sacrifice to them (<a href="/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14-18</a>). The order of the words, which is rightly given in the A.V., makes it a clear direction to offer the sacrifice to no one but the Lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then she hastened to fetch her husband, who first of all inquired of the person who had appeared, "Art thou the man who said to the woman" (sc., what has been related in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3-5</a>)? And when this was answered in the affirmative, he said still further (<a href="/judges/13-12.htm">Judges 13:12</a>), "Should thy word then come to pass, what will be the manner of the boy, and his doing?" The plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is construed ad sensum with the singular verb, because the words form one promise, so that the expression is not to be taken distributively, as Rosenmller supposes.
