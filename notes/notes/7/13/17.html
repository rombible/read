God has in his word given full directions concerning our duty, but never designed to answer other questionings. There are secret things which belong not to us, of which we must be quite contented to be ignorant, while in this world. The name of our Lord is wonderful and secret; but by his wonderful works he makes himself known as far as is needful for us. Prayer is the ascent of the soul to God. But without Christ in the heart by faith, our services are offensive smoke; in him, acceptable flame. We may apply this to Christ's sacrifice of himself for us; he ascended in the flame of his own offering, for by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, Heb 9:12. In Manoah's reflections there is great fear; We shall surely die. In his wife's reflection there is great faith. As a help meet for him, she encouraged him. Let believers who have had communion with God in the word and prayer, to whom he has graciously manifested himself, and who have had reason to think God has accepted their works, take encouragement from thence in a cloudy and dark day. God would not have done what he has done for my soul, if he had designed to forsake me, and leave me to perish at last; for his work is perfect. Learn to reason as Manoah's wife; If God designed me to perish under his wrath, he would not give me tokens of his favour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do thee honor - If applied to a man, it would be by gifts, such for instance as Balak promised to the prophet Balaam <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>, and such as were usually given to seers <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/5-5.htm">2 Kings 5:5</a>, <a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a> : if to God, it would be by sacrifices <a href="/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-20.
