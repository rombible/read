When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of such mothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept. Husbands and wives should tell each other their experiences of communion with God, and their improvements in acquaintance with him, that they may help each other in the way that is holy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man of God - The designation of a prophet, of frequent use in the books of Samuel and Kings <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-8</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/9-10.htm">1 Samuel 9:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-5.htm">1 Kings 13:5-6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>, and applied to Timothy by Paul in the New Testament <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>.<p>His countenance - Rather, "his appearance," as the word is rendered in <a href="/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. then Manoah entreated the Lord&#8212;On being informed by his wife of the welcome intimation, the husband made it the subject of earnest prayer to God.
