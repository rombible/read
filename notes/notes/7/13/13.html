We may observe that the angel gives no answer to Manoah’s question, how the child should be educated, &c., as willing that they should not be solicitous about that at the present, but leave it to the care of Providence, which, in proper time, would so direct matters in regard to the child, as that he should be fitted for the great purpose he was intended for.

Good men are more careful and desirous to know the duty to be done by them, than to know the events concerning them: duty is ours, events are God's. God will guide those by his counsel, who desire to know their duty, and apply to him to teach them. Pious parents, especially, will beg Divine assistance. The angel repeats the directions he had before given. There is need of much care for the right ordering both of ourselves and our children, that we may be duly separate from the world, and living sacrifices to the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Translate, "What shall be the manner (or ordering) of the child, and what shall be his work (or exploits)." The original message of the Angel had given information on these two points:<p>(1) how the child was to be brought up, namely, as a Nazarite;<p>(2) what he should do, namely, begin to deliver Israel.<p>Manoah desires to have the information repeated (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26-27</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-30.htm">1 Samuel 17:30</a>).

"Angel of God" is equivalent to "angel of the Lord" (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>; <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>), the angel in whom the invisible God reveals himself to men. The woman therefore imagined the person who appeared to her to have been a prophet, whose majestic appearance, however, had produced the impression that he was a superior being; consequently she had not ventured to ask him either his name or where he came from. </body></html>
