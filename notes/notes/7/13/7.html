Since Samuel was also a Nazarite, we see that the distress of the people had led mothers to meditate on the old law of life-dedication to God. In Samson’s case this vow was imposed on him from his birth, perhaps to teach the Israelites a moral lesson. Other Nazarites were John the Baptist and James, the Lord’s brother. It is not impossible that Joseph was a Nazarite, for in <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm" title="The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brothers.">Genesis 49:26</a> this word is used, though in the English Version it is rendered “separated” from his brethren.

When Israel was in this distress, Samson was born. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were born of such mothers. Mercies long waited for, often prove signal mercies; and by them others may be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy. The angel notices her affliction. God often sends comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel their troubles most. This deliverer of Israel must be devoted to God. Manoah's wife was satisfied that the messenger was of God. She gave her husband a particular account, both of the promise and of the precept. Husbands and wives should tell each other their experiences of communion with God, and their improvements in acquaintance with him, that they may help each other in the way that is holy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A man of God - The designation of a prophet, of frequent use in the books of Samuel and Kings <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-8</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/9-10.htm">1 Samuel 9:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-5.htm">1 Kings 13:5-6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>, and applied to Timothy by Paul in the New Testament <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>.<p>His countenance - Rather, "his appearance," as the word is rendered in <a href="/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. then Manoah entreated the Lord&#8212;On being informed by his wife of the welcome intimation, the husband made it the subject of earnest prayer to God.

The oppression of the Israelites by the Philistines, which is briefly hinted at in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7</a>, is noticed again here with the standing formula, "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord," etc. (cf. <a href="/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1</a>; <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>), as an introduction to the account of the life and acts of Samson, who began to deliver Israel from the hands of these enemies. Not only the birth of Samson, but the prediction of his birth, also fell, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>, within the period of the rule of the Philistines over Israel. Now, as their oppression lasted forty years, and Samson judged Israel for twenty years during that oppression (<a href="/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20</a>; <a href="/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a>), he must have commenced his judgeship at an early age, probably before the completion of his twentieth year; and with this the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/14.htm">Judges 14</a>, that his marriage with a Philistine woman furnished the occasion for his conflicts with these enemies of his people, fully agrees. The end of the forty years of the supremacy of the Philistines is not given in this book, which closes with the death of Samson. It did not terminate till the great victory which the Israelites gained over their enemies under the command of Samuel (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a>). Twenty years before this victory the Philistines had sent back the ark which they had taken from the Israelites, after keeping it for seven months in their own land (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>, and <a href="/1_samuel/6-1.htm">1 Samuel 6:1</a>). It was within these twenty years that most of the acts of Samson occurred. His first affair with the Philistines, however, namely on the occasion of his marriage, took place a year or two before this defeat of the Israelites, in which the sons of Eli were slain, the ark fell into the hands of the Philistines, and the high priest Eli fell from his seat and broke his neck on receiving the terrible news (<a href="/1_samuel/4-18.htm">1 Samuel 4:18</a>). Consequently Eli died a short time after the first appearance of Samson. </body></html>
