When Jericho was destroyed and laid under a curse, it would be quite in accordance with the Jewish feeling, which attached such “fatal force and fascination” to words, to avoid even the mention of the name. The Kenites would naturally attach less importance to the curse, or at any rate would not consider that they were braving it when they pitched their nomad tents among those beautiful groves of palms and balsams, which once made the soil “a divine country” (Jos. B. J. i. 6. §6; iv. 8, § 3; Antt. v. 1, § 22), though they have now entirely disappeared. Rabbinic tradition says that Jericho was assigned to Hobab.

The rabbinical story is that Jericho, with 500 cubits square of land, was given to Hobab.

If he might not himself, his posterity did accept the invitation of Moses (Nu 10:32) to accompany the Israelites to Canaan. Their first encampment was in the "city of palm trees"&#8212;not Jericho, of course, which was utterly destroyed, but the surrounding district, perhaps En-gedi, in early times called Hazezon-tamar (Ge 14:7), from the palm-grove which sheltered it. Thence they removed for some unknown cause, and associating themselves with Judah, joined in an expedition against Arad, in the southern part of Canaan (Nu 21:1). On the conquest of that district, some of this pastoral people pitched their tents there, while others migrated to the north (Jud 4:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Children of the Kenite, </span> i.e. of Jethro, so called from the people from whom he descended, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/numbers/24-21.htm" title="And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling place, and you put your nest in a rock.">Numbers 24:21</a>,22</span>.

The posterity of Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses; for though Jethro returned to his own country, after he had paid a visit to Moses in the wilderness, yet Hobab his son, at the persuasion of Moses, travelled with him and Israel through the wilderness, and went with them into Canaan, at least some of his descendants, and settled there, some in one part of the land, and some in another, of whom we read in several places of Scripture; they continued to the days of Jeremiah, and then went by the name of Rechabites, so called from Rechab, a descendant of Jethro: these <p>went up out of the city of palm trees; from the city of Jericho, as the Targum, so called from the great number of palm trees which grew near it, see <a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>. This is to be understood not of the city itself, that was utterly destroyed by Joshua, and the rebuilding of it was forbidden under a curse, but the country adjacent, the valley in which it stood, which was set with palm trees; here was a grove of palm trees (m), and the garden of balsam, which grew nowhere else, as Strabo (n) says; and who also observes, that here was a royal palace in his time; this belonged to Herod king of Judea in the times of Augustus Caesar, to whose palm tree groves there Horace (o) refers. Here the Kenites first settled when they came first over Jordan with Joshua, being a most pleasant and delightful place, and suitable to such persons who dwelt in tents, as they did, and answered to the promise of Moses to Hobab, <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>; and here it seems they had remained to this time: and now they left it, and came <p>with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah; which was also a convenient place for the habitation of such persons, who loved a solitary life. Perhaps the Canaanites about Jericho might be troublesome to them, and therefore chose to stay no longer, there; or, having a peculiar affection for the tribe of Judah, they chose to be within their lot; and the rather, as they were a warlike and valiant tribe, they might expect the greater safety and protection among them: <p>which lieth, in the south of Arad; that is, which wilderness of Judah lay there, of which name there was a country or city, see <a href="/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>; and here some of them dwelt to the times of Saul, the Amalekites then having got possession of the southern parts, which they infested and were troublesome to, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-6.htm">1 Samuel 15:6</a>, <p>and they went and dwelt among the people; of the tribe of Judah, near some of the cities which were in the wilderness; of which see <a href="/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>. <p>(m) Justin. e Trogo, l. 36. c. 3.((n) Geograph. l. 16. p. 525.

But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.">Exodus 2:15</a> ff; <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm" title="Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-1.htm" title="When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;">Exodus 18:1</a>, <a href="/numbers/10-29.htm" title="And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.">Numbers 10:29</a> he is a Midianite. Common to both traditions is Moses’ connexion by marriage with an Arab tribe. The verb <span class="ital">went up</span> in clause a is plur.; in clause b <span class="ital">went and dwelt</span> are sing., and may be corrected to the plur. (with RV., LXX. B <span class="ital">they dwelt</span>). But the sing, verbs in clause b perhaps imply that the text originally ran <span class="ital">And Hobab the Kenite … went up</span> (sing.) … <span class="ital">and went and dwelt</span>, omitting <span class="ital">the children of</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the city of palm trees</span>] i.e. Jericho, cf. <a href="/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Jdg 3:13</a> <span class="ital">n.</span> and <a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm" title="And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, to Zoar.">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/28-15.htm" title="And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers: then they returned to Samaria.">2 Chronicles 28:15</a>. The order in which the stages of the invasion are mentioned, Jerusalem, Hebron, Debir, Arad, Zephath, seems to indicate a movement starting from the E. and advancing towards the S.; hence Jericho, in the neighbourhood of Gilgal (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm" title="And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.">Jdg 2:1</a>), may well have been the point of departure. On the theory that Judah came up from Kadesh in the southern desert, a ‘city of palm trees’ has been looked for in the S., and Tamar, i.e. ‘palm tree’ (<a href="/ezekiel/47-19.htm" title="And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.">Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/48-28.htm" title="And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.">Ezekiel 48:28</a>), in S.E. Palestine, is suggested as the place (Steuernagel, l.c. 75 ff.). The possibility that the Calebites and other clans which in time coalesced under the name of Judah, entered the land from the South has been noticed above, in <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Jdg 1:10</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad</span>] in the <span class="bld">Negeb of Arad</span>. The wilderness, of Judah (Psalms 63 title, St <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a>, cf. <a href="/joshua/15-61.htm" title="In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,">Joshua 15:61</a>) was the barren, rugged tract which descends from the Central Highlands eastwards to the Dead Sea. It is possible that the term may have included Arad = Tell ‘Arâd, 17 m. S.E. of Hebron (cf. on <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/1-9.htm" title="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Jdg 1:9</a></span>); yet the description of the ‘wilderness of Judah’ (properly in the E.) as within the Negeb (in the S.) is surprising. The text is certainly incorrect. The LXX. cod. A reads ‘into the desert of Judah, which is in the south, at the descent of Arad’; cod. B ‘into the desert which is in the south of Judah, which is at the descent of Arad.’ Both recensions of the LXX give <span class="ital">the descent of Arad</span> (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-5.htm" title="And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: why the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.">Joshua 7:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven on them to Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.">Joshua 10:11</a> ‘the going down’) instead of <span class="ital">the Negeb of Arad</span>; in the neighbourhood of Tell ‘Arâd the Judaean hills descend to the Wadi Seyyal on the E. and the Wadi el-Milḥ on the W., and thence to the plains. Following the LXX. cod. B we might restore ‘into the desert which is in the Negeb of Judah in the descent of Arad,’ which would give excellent sense; but we cannot feel sure that the LXX represents the original text. Other emendations are: ‘the wilderness of Judah which is in the descent of Arad’ (Budde); ‘into the wilderness of Arad’ (Moore, omitting the rest as partly gloss and partly correction of the Hebr.); ‘the Kenites went up from the city of palm-trees which is in the Negeb with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Arad’ (Steuernagel). None of these is quite convincing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the people</span>] gives no sense; read <span class="ital">with the</span> <span class="bld">Amalekite</span>, following a group of cursive MSS. of the LXX which have ‘with the people Amalek’; this agrees with <a href="/1_samuel/15-6.htm" title="And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.">1 Samuel 15:6</a>, <a href="/context/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever....">Numbers 24:20-22</a>. ‘While the main Judaean stock settled on the arable land and in cities, and intermarried with the Canaanites, the Kenites, true to their nomadic origin, turned into the wilderness of Judah, and dwelt with the Amalekites’ (G. A. Smith, <span class="ital">Hist. Geogr.</span>, p. 277 f.). The Kenites, who were related to the Kenizzites (<a href="/genesis/15-19.htm" title="The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,">Genesis 15:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-11.htm" title="And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.">Genesis 36:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-15.htm" title="These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,">Genesis 36:15</a>), seem to have been a branch of the Amalekites (Num. l. c.); they continued to dwell near Judah in the Negeb <a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm" title="And Achish said, Where have you made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.">1 Samuel 27:10</a>, on friendly terms <span class="ital">ib.</span> <a href="/1_samuel/30-29.htm" title="And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,">1 Samuel 30:29</a>.

Hobab and his tribe, a branch of the Midianites, called Kenites, from an unknown ancestor, <span class="accented">Kain</span>, at first settled in the city of palm trees, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jericho (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>); but it seems that when Judah started on his expedition with Simeon to conquer the south laud, the Kenites went with him.
