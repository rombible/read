In these respects they inquired of the Lord. God appoints service according to the strength he has given. From those who are most able, most work is expected. Judah was first in dignity, and must be first in duty. Judah's service will not avail unless God give success; but God will not give the success, unless Judah applies to the service. Judah was the most considerable of all the tribes, and Simeon the least; yet Judah begs Simeon's friendship, and prays for aid from him. It becomes Israelites to help one another against Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should strengthen one another. Those who thus help one another in love, have reason to hope that God will graciously help both. Adoni-bezek was taken prisoner. This prince had been a severe tyrant. The Israelites, doubtless under the Divine direction, made him suffer what he had done to others; and his own conscience confessed that he was justly treated as he had treated others. Thus the righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment answer the sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render "and the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it," etc. With regard to the capture of Jerusalem there is some obscurity. It is here said to have been taken, smitten with the edge of the sword, and burned, by the children of Judah. In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a>, <a href="/joshua/12-10.htm">Joshua 12:10</a> the Jebusite and the king of Jerusalem are enumerated among Joshua's conquests, but without any distinct mention of the capture of the city; and in the marginal reference we read that the Jebusites were not expelled from Jerusalem, but dwelt with the children of Judah (compare <a href="/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>). Further, we learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10-12</a> that Jerusalem was wholly a Jebusite city in the lifetime of Phinehas <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>, and so it continued until the reign of David <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>. The conclusion is that Jerusalem was only taken once, namely, at the time here described, and that this was in the lifetime of Joshua; but that the children of Judah did not occupy it in sufficient force to prevent the return of the Jebusites, who gradually recovered complete possession.<p>Set the city on fire - A phrase found only at <a href="/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, and <a href="/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it&#8212;The capture of this important city, which ranks among the early incidents in the war of invasion (Jos 15:63), is here noticed to account for its being in the possession of the Judahites; and they brought Adoni-bezek thither [Jud 1:7], in order, probably, that his fate being rendered so public, might inspire terror far and wide. Similar inroads were made into the other unconquered parts of Judah's inheritance [Jud 1:9-11]. The story of Caleb's acquisition of Hebron is here repeated (Jos 15:16-19).

A short time before his death, Joshua had gathered the elders and heads of the people around him, and set before them the entire destruction of the Canaanites through the omnipotent help of the Lord, if they would only adhere with fidelity to the Lord; whilst, at the same time, he also pointed out to them the dangers of apostasy from the Lord (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/23.htm">Joshua 23</a>). Remembering this admonition and warning, the Israelites inquired, after Joshua's death, who should begin the war against the Canaanites who still remained to be destroyed; and the Lord answered, "Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand" (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, <a href="/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, to ask with Jehovah for the purpose of obtaining a declaration of the divine will, is substantially the same as &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>), to inquire the will of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim of the high priest. From this time forward inquiring of the Lord occurs with greater frequency (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-23.htm">Judges 20:23</a>, <a href="/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-10.htm">1 Samuel 22:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>, etc.), as well as the synonymous expression "ask of Elohim" in <a href="/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5</a>; <a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-37.htm">1 Samuel 14:37</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/14-10.htm">1 Chronicles 14:10</a>; whereas Moses and Joshua received direct revelations from God. The phrase &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "go up to the Canaanites," is defined more precisely by the following words, "to fight against them;" so that &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; is used here also to denote the campaign against a nation (see at <a href="/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>), without there being any necessity, however, for us to take &#1488;&#1500; in the sense of &#1506;&#1500;. &#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; signifies "to go up in the beginning," i.e., to open or commence the war; not to hold the commandership in the war, as the Sept., Vulgate, and others render it (see <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/10-18.htm">Judges 10:18</a>, where &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; is expressly distinguished from being the chief or leader). Moreover, &#1502;&#1497; does not mean who? i.e., what person, but, as the answer clearly shows, what tribe? Now a tribe could open the war, and take the lead at the head of the other tribes, but could not be the commander-in-chief. In the present instance, however, Judah did not even enter upon the war at the head of all the tribes, but simply joined with the tribe of Simeon to make a common attack upon the Canaanites in their inheritance. The promise in <a href="/judges/1-2.htm">Judges 1:2</a> is the same as that in <a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1</a>, etc. "The land" is not merely the land allotted to the tribe of Judah, or Judah's inheritance, as Bertheau supposes, for Judah conquered Jerusalem (<a href="/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>), which had been allotted to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>), but the land of Canaan generally, so far as it was still in the possession of the Canaanites and was to be conquered by Judah. The reason why Judah was to commence the hostilities is not to be sought for in the fact that Judah was the most numerous of all the tribes (Rosenmller), but rather in the fact that Judah had already been appointed by the blessing of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8</a>.) to be the champion of his brethren. </body></html>
