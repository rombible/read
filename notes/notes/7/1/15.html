It is here said to have been taken, smitten with the edge of the sword, and burned, by the children of Judah. In <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/12-8.htm">Joshua 12:8</a>, <a href="/joshua/12-10.htm">Joshua 12:10</a> the Jebusite and the king of Jerusalem are enumerated among Joshua's conquests, but without any distinct mention of the capture of the city; and in the marginal reference we read that the Jebusites were not expelled from Jerusalem, but dwelt with the children of Judah (compare <a href="/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21</a>). Further, we learn from <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10-12</a> that Jerusalem was wholly a Jebusite city in the lifetime of Phinehas <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>, and so it continued until the reign of David <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>. The conclusion is that Jerusalem was only taken once, namely, at the time here described, and that this was in the lifetime of Joshua; but that the children of Judah did not occupy it in sufficient force to prevent the return of the Jebusites, who gradually recovered complete possession.<p>Set the city on fire - A phrase found only at <a href="/judges/20-48.htm">Judges 20:48</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>, and <a href="/psalms/74-7.htm">Psalm 74:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it&#8212;The capture of this important city, which ranks among the early incidents in the war of invasion (Jos 15:63), is here noticed to account for its being in the possession of the Judahites; and they brought Adoni-bezek thither [Jud 1:7], in order, probably, that his fate being rendered so public, might inspire terror far and wide. Similar inroads were made into the other unconquered parts of Judah's inheritance [Jud 1:9-11]. The story of Caleb's acquisition of Hebron is here repeated (Jos 15:16-19).

Gullath or Golath, pronounced Gulloth in the text, has the ending <span class="ital">ath</span> as in other old Canaanite names, e.g. Zephath, Baalath, Zarephath; the rendering ‘springs’ is conjectural; in <a href="/zechariah/4-3.htm" title="And two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side thereof.">Zechariah 4:3</a>, <a href="/1_kings/7-41.htm" title="The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;">1 Kings 7:41</a> f. the word means ‘bowl.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the upper springs and the nether springs</span>] <span class="bld">Gullath-illith and Gullath-taḥtith</span> (changing the plur. of the text to sing.), proper names, without the article.

The springs fall into three groups, and may well correspond with <span class="ital">Gullath-upper</span> and <span class="ital">Gullath-lower</span>. This attractive story was no doubt told to explain how the springs came to be in the possession of the Othnielites of Debir, when they ought by rights to belong to the clan of Caleb in Hebron; cf. the stories of the wells of Rehoboth and Beer-sheba, <a href="/context/genesis/26-22.htm" title="And he removed from there, and dig another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land....">Genesis 26:22-33</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[23] Given in the P.E.F. large Map of W.
