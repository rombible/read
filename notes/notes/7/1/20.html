(See <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a> note.) It is a curious fact that when Rameses III took Askelon it was occupied, not by Philistines, but apparently by Hebrews. Rameses began to reign in 1269 B.C., and reigned 25 years. At any time between 1269 and 1244 B.C. such occupation of Askelon by Hebrews agrees with the Book of Judges. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. the Lord was with Judah; &#8230; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley&#8212;The war was of the Lord, whose omnipotent aid would have ensured their success in every encounter, whether on the mountains or the plains, with foot soldiers or cavalry.
