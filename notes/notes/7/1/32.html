Owing to slothfulness and cowardice, they would not be at the pains to complete their conquests. It was also owing to their covetousness: they were willing to let the Canaanites live among them, that they might make advantage of them. They had not the dread and detestation of idolatry they ought to have had. The same unbelief that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan, kept them now out of the full possession of it. Distrust of the power and promise of God deprived them of advantages, and brought them into troubles. Thus many a believer who begins well is hindered. His graces languish, his lusts revive, Satan plies him with suitable temptations, the world recovers its hold; he brings guilt into his conscience, anguish into his heart, discredit on his character, and reproach on the gospel. Though he may have sharp rebukes, and be so recovered that he does not perish, yet he will have deeply to lament his folly through his remaining days; and upon his dying bed to mourn over the opportunities of glorifying God and serving the church he has lost. We can have no fellowship with the enemies of God within us or around us, but to our hurt; therefore our only wisdom is to maintain unceasing war against them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is an evidence of the power of the Canaanite in this portion of the land that it is not said (compare <a href="/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30</a>) that the Canaanites dwelt among the Asherites, but that the Asherites (and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-33.htm">Judges 1:33</a>, Naphtali) "dwelt among the Canaanites;" nor are the Canaanites in Accho, Zidon, and the other Asherite cities, said to have become tributaries. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-36. The same course of subjugation was carried on in the other tribes to a partial extent, and with varying success. Many of the natives, no doubt, during the progress of this exterminating war, saved themselves by flight and became, it is thought, the first colonists in Greece, Italy, and other countries. But a large portion made a stout resistance and retained possession of their old abodes in Canaan. In other cases, when the natives were vanquished, avarice led the Israelites to spare the idolaters, contrary to the express command of God; and their disobedience to His orders in this matter involved them in many troubles which this book describes.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land,....

The situation of this Luz is altogether unknown. Even the situation of the land of the Hittites cannot be more precisely determined; for we find Hittites at Hebron in the times of Abraham and Moses (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>), and also upon the mountains of Palestine (<a href="/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>), and at a later period on the north-east of Canaan on the borders of Syria (<a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>). That the Hittites were one of the most numerous and widespread of the tribes of the Canaanites, is evident from the fact that, in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>, the Canaanites generally are described as Hittites. </body></html>
