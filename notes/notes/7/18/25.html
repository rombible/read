The readiness with which they joined in the attempt to recover the stolen articles affords a presumption that the advantages of the chapel had been open to all in the neighborhood; and the importance which Micah, like Laban, attached to his teraphim, is seen by the urgency with which he pursued the thieves, and the risk of his life in attempting to procure their restoration. Finding his party, however, not a match for the Danites, he thought it prudent to desist, well knowing the rule which was then prevalent in the land, that<p>"They should take who had the power,<p>And they should keep who could."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy voice; </span> thy complaints and reproaches. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Angry fellows; </span> the soldiers, who are in themselves sharp and fierce, and will soon be inflamed by thy provoking words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And thou lose thy life; </span> which, notwithstanding all thy pretences, thou dost value more than thy images, as indeed appeared from his following practice. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Dan said unto him, let not thy voice be heard among us,....

With the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; the narrative passes from the aorist or historical tense &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; into the perfect. "The perfects do not denote the coming and taking on the part of the five men as a continuation of the previous account, but place the coming and taking in the same sphere of time as that to which the following clause, 'and the priest stood,' etc., belongs" (Bertheau). But in order to explain what appears very surprising, viz., that the priest should have stood before the gate whilst his house of God was being robbed, the course which the affair took is explained more clearly afterwards in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a>, in the form of a circumstantial clause. Consequently the verbs in these verses ought to be rendered as pluperfects, and the different clauses comprised in one period, <a href="/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a> forming the protasis, and <a href="/judges/18-19.htm">Judges 18:19</a> the apodosis. "Namely, when those (five) men had come into Micah's house, and had taken the image of the ephod, etc., and the priest had said to them, What are ye doing? they had said to him, Be silent, lay thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us, and become a father and priest to us (see <a href="/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>). Is it better to be a priest to the house of a single man, or to a tribe and family in Israel?" The combination &#1492;&#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1491; &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; (the ephod-pesel), i.e., the image belonging to the ephod, may be explained on the ground, that the use of the ephod as a means of ascertaining the will of God presupposes the existence of an image of Jehovah, and does not prove that the ephod served as a covering for the Pesel. The priest put on the ephod when he was about to inquire of God. The &#1488;&#1493; in the second question is different from &#1488;&#1501;, and signifies "or rather" (see <a href="/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>), indicating an improvement upon the first question (see Ewald, 352, a.). Consequently it is not a sign of a later usage of speech, as Bertheau supposes. The word &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (unto a family) serves as a more minute definition or limitation of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; (to a tribe). </body></html>
