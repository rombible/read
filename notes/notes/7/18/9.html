That is, prepare for war, and go up in an hostile manner against the present possessors of the land, not doubting of being masters of it easily: <p>for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good. Adrichomius (x) says it was very good pasture land, and fertile, abounding with fruits of all kinds; and the same is attested by Josephus (y): <p>and are ye still? can ye sit still, and be easy, and not bestir yourselves to go up and possess so good a country, of which an easy conquest may be made? or, affirmatively, "ye are still or silent" (z); ye make no answer to what we say, and seem careless and indifferent about the matter; or by way of exhortation, "be silent", either that the people may remain in their quiet, easy, careless state, and lest, on hearing designs against them, should prepare for their defence; or, as Abarbinel, lest any of the other tribes of Israel should hear of it, and go take it before them: <p>be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land; they suggest that there was scarce anything more to be done than to go and take possession, and that it would be altogether owing to their sloth and indolence if they did not. <p>(x) Ut supra.

Moore thus separates the two: (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">Arise, and let us go up against them: for when ye come, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large, for it is a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth</span>; (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">And they said, We have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land; God hath given it into your hand</span>.

He distinguishes the sources as follows: (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">And they said, Arise and let us go up</span> [<span class="ital">to Laish</span>]; <span class="ital">for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth</span>; (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">And they said</span>, [<span class="ital">Why</span>] <span class="ital">are ye still? be not slothful to go</span> [<span class="ital">to Laish</span>] <span class="ital">to possess the land, for</span> [<span class="ital">Jehovah</span>] <span class="ital">hath given it into your hand.
