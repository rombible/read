Thus those who please themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring any thing to their hands that further them in their evil way, are apt from thence to think that God is pleased with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were gathered together - literally, "were called together." The men, who were all Micah's workmen, were probably in the fields with their master at the time of the robbery. When the women saw what was done they gave the alarm, and Micah called the men together as quickly as possible, and pursued the Danites and overtook them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-26. the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together&#8212;The robbers of the chapel being soon detected, a hot pursuit was forthwith commenced by Micah, at the head of a considerable body of followers. The readiness with which they joined in the attempt to recover the stolen articles affords a presumption that the advantages of the chapel had been open to all in the neighborhood; and the importance which Micah, like Laban, attached to his teraphim, is seen by the urgency with which he pursued the thieves, and the risk of his life in attempting to procure their restoration. Finding his party, however, not a match for the Danites, he thought it prudent to desist, well knowing the rule which was then prevalent in the land, that<p>"They should take who had the power,<p>And they should keep who could."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Dan went their way,....
