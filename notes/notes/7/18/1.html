The English Version interpolates the words “all their” before “inheritance,” apparently to avoid difficulties. But these glosses, however well meant, are almost always a violation of the primary duty of translation, which is to be rigidly faithful to the* original.

The Danites Seek Out an Inheritance.<p>1-6. In those days &#8230; the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in&#8212;The Danites had a territory assigned them as well as the other tribes. But either through indolence, or a lack of energy, they did not acquire the full possession of their allotment, but suffered a considerable portion of it to be wrested out of their hands by the encroachments of their powerful neighbors, the Philistines. In consequence, being straitened for room, a considerable number resolved on trying to effect a new and additional settlement in a remote part of the land. A small deputation, being despatched to reconnoitre the country, arrived on their progress northward at the residence of Micah. Recognizing his priest as one of their former acquaintances, or perhaps by his provincial dialect, they eagerly enlisted his services in ascertaining the result of their present expedition. His answer, though apparently promising, was delusive, and really as ambiguous as those of the heathen oracles. This application brings out still more clearly and fully than the schism of Micah the woeful degeneracy of the times. The Danites expressed no emotions either of surprise or of indignation at a Levite daring to assume the priestly functions, and at the existence of a rival establishment to that of Shiloh. They were ready to seek, through means of the teraphim, the information that could only be lawfully applied for through the high priest's Urim. Being thus equally erroneous in their views and habits as Micah, they show the low state of religion, and how much superstition prevailed in all parts of the land.Those of the tribe of Dan, having not sufficient inheritance, send forth five men to spy out a place; they come to the house of Micah, and desire the Levite to ask counsel of God touching their journey, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/context/judges/18-1.htm" title="In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel....">Judges 18:1-5</a></span>.

The bulk of the tribe, as we read in <a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>, did receive their inheritance by lot before the death of Joshua (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 49) and Eleazar (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 51). But as long as any part of the tribe was not settled, the tribe as such, in its unity, was still seeking a settlement. The land for their inheritance had not yet fallen to the tribe in its integrity. This is in part accounted for by what we read <a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>, that the Amorites would not suffer the children of Dan to come down to the valley, so that those who could not get possession of their land there would be crowded into other parts of the tribal territory. These Danites, of whom we are here reading, were dwelling in Zorah and Eshtaol (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1, 25</a>), as we see by vers. 2, 11. <span class="cmt_word">Unto that day</span>, etc. Translate this clause, <span class="accented">For unto that day</span> the land (meaning <span class="accented">the whole land</span>) <span class="accented">had not fallen unto them in the midst of the tribes of Israel for an inheritance.</span> The words <span class="accented">the land</span> must be supplied after the analogy of <a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>.

Houbigant, by an ingenious conjecture, gives the sense <span class="accented">was too narrow for them.</span> Prom the mention of this migration in the Book of Joshua, it is probable that it took place not many years after Joshua's death. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Appointment of a Levite as Priest. - <a href="/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a>. In the absence of a Levitical priest, Micah had first of all appointed one of his sons as priest at his sanctuary. He afterwards found a Levite for this service. A young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who, being a Levite, stayed (&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;) there (in Bethlehem) as a stranger, left this town to sojourn "at the place which he should find," sc., as a place that would afford him shelter and support, and came up to the mountains of Ephraim to Micah's house, "making his journey," i.e., upon his journey. (On the use of the inf. constr. with &#1500; in the sense of the Latin gerund in do, see Ewald, 280, d.) Bethlehem was not a Levitical town. The young Levite from Bethlehem was neither born there nor made a citizen of the place, but simply "sojourned there," i.e., dwelt there temporarily as a stranger. The further statement as to his descent (mishpachath Judah) is not to be understood as signifying that he was a descendant of some family in the tribe of Judah, but simply that he belonged to the Levites who dwelt in the tribe of Judah, and were reckoned in all civil matters as belonging to that tribe. On the division of the land, it is true that it was only to the priests that dwelling-places were allotted in the inheritance of this tribe (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/21-9.htm">Joshua 21:9-19</a>), whilst the rest of the Levites, even the non-priestly members of the family of Kohath, received their dwelling-places among the other tribes (<a href="/joshua/21-20.htm">Joshua 21:20</a>.). At the same time, as many of the towns which were allotted to the different tribes remained for a long time in the possession of the Canaanites, and the Israelites did not enter at once into the full and undisputed possession of their inheritance, it might easily so happen that different towns which were allotted to the Levites remained in possession of the Canaanites, and consequently that the Levites were compelled to seek a settlement in other places. It might also happen that individuals among the Levites themselves, who were disinclined to perform the service assigned them by the law, would remove from the Levitical towns and seek some other occupation elsewhere (see also at <a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>).<p>(Note: There is no reason, therefore, for pronouncing the words &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; (of the family of Judah) a gloss, and erasing them from the text, as Houbigant proposes. The omission of them from the Cod. Vat. of the lxx, and from the Syriac, is not enough to warrant this, as they occur in the Cod. Al. of the lxx, and their absence from the authorities mentioned may easily be accounted for from the difficulty which was felt in explaining their meaning. On the other hand, it is impossible to imagine any reason for the interpolation of such a gloss into the text.) </body></html>
