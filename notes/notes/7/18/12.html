Their journey led them through the territory of Judah, and their first halting place was "behind," that is, on the west of Kirjath-jearim, on a spot called afterwards "the camp of Dan." Prosecuting the northern route, they skirted the base of the Ephraimite hills. On approaching the neighborhood of Micah's residence, the spies having given information that a private sanctuary was kept there, the priest of which had rendered them important service when on their exploring expedition, it was unanimously agreed that both he and the furniture of the establishment would be a valuable acquisition to their proposed settlement. A plan of spoliation was immediately formed. While the armed men stood sentinels at the gates, the five spies broke into the chapel, pillaged the images and vestments, and succeeded in bribing the priest also by a tempting offer to transfer his services to their new colony. Taking charge of the ephod, the teraphim, and the graven image, he "went in the midst of the people"&#8212;a central position assigned him in the march, perhaps for his personal security; but more probably in imitation of the place appointed for the priests and the ark, in the middle of the congregated tribes, on the marches through the wilderness. This theft presents a curious medley of low morality and strong religious feeling. The Danites exemplified a deep-seated principle of our nature&#8212;that men have religious affections, which must have an object on which these may be exercised, while they are often not very discriminating in the choice of the objects. In proportion to the slender influence religion wields over the heart, the greater is the importance attached to external rites; and in the exact observance of these, the conscience is fully satisfied, and seldom or never molested by reflections on the breach of minor morals.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Kirjath-jearim, </span> called <span class="ital">Kirjath-baal</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/15-60.htm" title="Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:60</a></span>; a city lying in the northern parts of Judah, in the road to Laish; yet not in the city, but in the fields belonging to it, as the following words evince. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behind Kirjath-jearim, </span> i.e. westward from it, as the western sea is called the hindermost sea, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/11-24.htm" title="Every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your coast be.">Deu 11:24</a></span>; and as, on the contrary, the east is called <span class="ital">Keedem</span>, which signifies the forepart. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they went up and pitched in Kirjathjearim in Judah,....
