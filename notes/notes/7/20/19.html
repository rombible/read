At this time the ark was at Bethel (compare <a href="/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>), and not at Shiloh. It is not unlikely that though Shiloh was the chief residence of the ark <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>, yet the tabernacle, being moveable, was, either at stated times, or as occasion required, moved to where the Judge resided, or the congregation assembled (compare <a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). On the present occasion the ark may have been moved to Bethel for the convenience of proximity to the great national council at Mizpeh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 20:18-28.

But they ought to have done it at the commencement of their proceedings. Instead of this, all their plans were formed, and never doubting, it would seem, that the war was just and inevitable, the only subject of their inquiry related to the precedency of the tribes&#8212;a point which it is likely was discussed in the assembly. Had they asked counsel of God sooner, their expedition would have been conducted on a different principle&#8212;most probably by reducing the number of fighting men, as in the case of Gideon's army. As it was, the vast number of volunteers formed an excessive and unwieldy force, unfit for strenuous and united action against a small, compact, and well-directed army. A panic ensued, and the confederate tribes, in two successive engagements, sustained great losses. These repeated disasters (notwithstanding their attack on Benjamin had been divinely authorized) overwhelmed them with shame and sorrow. Led to reflection, they became sensible of their guilt in not repressing their national idolatries, as well as in too proudly relying on their superior numbers and the precipitate rashness of this expedition. Having humbled themselves by prayer and fasting, as well as observed the appointed method of expiating their sins, they were assured of acceptance as well as of victory. The presence and services of Phinehas on this occasion help us to ascertain the chronology thus far, that the date of the occurrence must be fixed shortly after the death of Joshua.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Israel rose up in the morning,....

"The tribes of Benjamin" are the same as "the families of Benjamin:" the historian pictured to himself the different divisions of the tribe of Benjamin as warlike powers about to carry on a war with the other tribes of Israel. The word shebet (tribe) is used in a different way in <a href="/numbers/4-18.htm">Numbers 4:18</a>. But the Benjaminites would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the other tribes of Israel. The Keri (sons of Benjamin) is a needless alteration, since Benjamin may be construed with the plural as a collective term. By refusing this just demand on the part of the other tribes, the Benjaminites took the side of the culprits in Gibeah, and compelled the congregation to make war upon the whole tribe. </body></html>
