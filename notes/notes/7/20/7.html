All the Israelites went out (rose up from their dwelling-places) to assemble together as a congregation like one man; all the tribes from Dan, the northern boundary of the land (i.e., Dan-laish, <a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>), to Beersheba, the most southerly town of Canaan (see at <a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>), and the land of Gilead, i.e., the inhabitants of the land to the east of the Jordan, "to Jehovah at Mizpeh" in Benjamin, i.e., the present Nebi-samwil, in the neighbourhood of Kirjath-jearim, on the western border of the tribe of Benjamin (see at <a href="/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>). It by no means follows with certainty from the expression "to Jehovah," that there was a sanctuary at Mizpeh, or that the ark of the covenant was taken thither, but simply that the meeting took place in the sight of Jehovah, or that the congregation assembled together to hold a judicial court, which they held in the name of Jehovah, analogous to the expression el-Elohim in <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a>. It was not essential to a judicial proceeding that the ark should be present. At this assembly the pinnoth (the corner-pillars) of the whole nation presented themselves, i.e., the heads and fathers as the supports of the congregation or of the sate organism (vid., <a href="/1_samuel/14-38.htm">1 Samuel 14:38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-13.htm">Isaiah 19:13</a>), even of all the tribes of Israel four hundred thousand men on foot, drawing the sword, i.e., armed foot soldiers ready for battle.</body></html>
