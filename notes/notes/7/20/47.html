But as the Benjamites numbered 26,700 men <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15</a>, and 600 escaped to the rock of Rimmon, it is clear that 1,100 are unaccounted for, partly from no account being taken of those who fell in the battles of the two first days, partly from the use of round numbers, or from some other cause. The numbers given both here and in <a href="/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a> are expressly restricted to those who fell on "that" (the third) "day." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46. all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men&#8212;On comparing this with Jud 20:35, it will be seen that the loss is stated here in round numbers and is confined only to that of the third day.

If these 600 survivors are added to the 25,000, or 25,100, enumerated as slain (vers. '35, 44), it gives a total of 25,700. But the total number of Benjamites, as given in ver. 15, was 26,700. There remain, therefore, 1000 men unaccounted for. These may, have been killed partly in the two first days successful battles (vers. 21, 25), and partly in the different cities into which they had escaped, when the general massacre recorded in ver. 48 took place. <span class="cmt_word">The rock Rimmon</span>. There are two proposed identifications of this place. One makes it the same as <span class="accented">Rummon</span>, "a village perched on the summit of a conical chalky hill," "rising on the south side to a height of several hundred feet from the Wady Muti-yah," and defended on the west side "by a cross valley of great depth," which lies three miles east of Bethel, and seven miles northeast of Gibeah (Tulell el-Ful), and is situated in the wilderness between the highlands of Benjamin and the Jordan. This is advocated by Robinson ('Biblical Researches,' 1:440), by Mr. Grove in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and by Lt. Conder ('Quart. State. for July 1880,' P. 173). The other is advocated by Mr. W. F. Birch ('Pal. Expl., Quart. State. for April 1880'). This identifies it with the <span class="accented">Wady er-Rummon</span>, discovered by Mr. Rawnsley, where there is a vast cave, <span class="accented">Mugharet el Jai</span>, about a mile and a half from Geba, capable, according to the local tradition, of holding 600 men, and used to the present day by the villagers as a place of refuge from the government persecutions According to this view, the statement that they abode in the rock Rimmon is strictly correct. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And the men of Israel turned in the battle:" that is to say, as is afterwards more fully explained in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-39.htm">Judges 20:39</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>, in the form of a long new circumstantial clause, whilst Benjamin had begun to smite, etc. (repeated from <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-31.htm">Judges 20:31</a>, <a href="/judges/20-32.htm">Judges 20:32</a>), and the cloud (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;  equals  &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a>) had begun to ascend out of the city as a pillar of smoke, and Benjamin turned back, and behold the whole city ascended towards heaven (in smoke), Israel turned (fighting) and Benjamin was terrified, for it saw that misfortune had come upon it (see <a href="/judges/20-34.htm">Judges 20:34</a>). In <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-41.htm">Judges 20:41</a>, the thread of the narrative, which was interrupted by the long circumstantial clause, is again resumed by the repetition of "and the men of Israel turned."</body></html>
