Josephus (a) says, they were forced into, and cooped up, in a hollow place in a valley, so that they could not escape: <p>and chased them; or "caused to pursue" (b); calling after them a pursuit, crying to one another as they went along, saying, pursue them, pursue them; so Jarchi and Kimchi; which cry, as it inspired the pursuers with zeal, so they pursued with terror: <p>and trod them down with ease; they making no resistance, being quite dispirited; the Targrim is,"from the house of their rest,''where they took up their rest, and designed to rest that night, but could not, being so closely pursued, and diligently sought after. Some take "menuchah", rendered "ease", to be the name of a place, from or unto which they were pursued and trodden down, see <a href="/1_chronicles/2-52.htm">1 Chronicles 2:52</a> and so the Septuagint seems to take it for the name of a place, rendering it, "from Noua": <p>over against Gibeah, towards the sunrising; that is, as Jarchi interprets it, to the east of Gibeah, there was this overthrow and slaughter made. <p>(a) Ut supra.

The unidiomatic style (<span class="ital">and … and</span> are not in the original), together with the obscurity of the sense, prove that the text is corrupt. Of the various attempts to emend it, the following is as plausible as any: taking the two Hebr. words for <span class="ital">the Benjamites … chased them</span> as a doublet of the next two <span class="ital">at their resting place, trode them down</span>, and omitting the latter, we may read <span class="ital">they cut down</span> (LXX. cod. B) <span class="ital">Benjamin and pursued him as far as over against Geba toward the sunrising</span>. The <span class="ital">Gibeah</span> of the text was not E. of the flying Benjamites; as elsewhere it is confused with <span class="ital">Geba</span> = Jeba‘, 3 m. N.E. of Tell el-Fûl. Jeba‘ lies on the way to Rammôn; but before the fugitives could reach their place of refuge (Rimmon <span class="ital"><a href="/judges/20-45.htm" title="And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.">Jdg 20:45</a></span>), the narrow defile of the Wadi Suwçnît (<a href="/1_samuel/14-4.htm" title="And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.">1 Samuel 14:4</a> ff.), between Jeba‘ and Machmâs, would stop further pursuit: accordingly <span class="ital">over against Geba</span> they were <span class="ital">cut down</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus they inclosed</span>, etc. Another difficult passage, having all the appearance of being a quotation from some poetical description of the battle. The tenses of the verbs and the absence of any conjunctions in the Hebrew makes the diction like that of <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. The italic words <span class="accented">thus</span> and the two ands ought to be omitted, to give the stately march of the original. "They inclosed, etc.; they chased them; they trod them down," etc. <span class="accented">They inclosed</span> seems to refer to the stratagem by which the Benjamites were <span class="accented">surrounded</span> by the ambush in their rear and the Israelites in front. Then came the pursuit - "they chased them;" then the massacre - "they trod them down." The three verbs describe the three stages of the battle. <span class="cmt_word">With ease</span>. It does not seem possible that the Hebrew word <span class="accented">menuchah</span> can have this meaning. It means sometimes a <span class="accented">place of rest</span>, and sometimes <span class="accented">a state of rest.</span> Taking the latter meaning, the words <span class="accented">they trod them into rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">they quieted them by crushing them to death under their</span> feet, or <span class="accented">in rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">unresisting.</span> Some render it <span class="accented">unto Menuchah</span>, as if <span class="accented">Menuchah</span> was the name of a place, or <span class="accented">from Nochah</span>, as the Septuagint does. Others, <span class="accented">at the place of rest</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at every place where they halted to rest the enemy was upon them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Benjaminites, for instance, saw (this is the proper rendering of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; with vav consec., which merely indicates the order of thought, not that of time) that they were beaten, and the man of Israel vacated the field before Benjamin (&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, to give place by falling back and flying), because they relied upon the ambush which they had placed against Gibeah. The Benjaminites did not perceive this till the ambush fell upon their rear. But the ambush itself, as is added in <a href="/judges/20-37.htm">Judges 20:37</a> by way of further explanation, hastened and fell (fell as quickly as possible) into Gibeah, and went thither and smote the whole town with the edge of the sword. To this there is added the further explanation in <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a> : "And the arrangement of the Israelites with the ambush was this: multiply, to cause smoke-rising to ascend (i.e., cause a great cloud of smoke to ascend) out of the city." The only objection that can be raised to this view of &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;, as the imperative Hiphil of &#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, is the suffix &#1501;-attached to &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, since this is unsuitable to a direct address. This suffix can only be explained by supposing that there is an admixture of two constructions, the direct appeal, and the indirect explanation, that they were to cause to ascend. If this be not admitted, however, we can only follow Studer, and erase the suffix as an error of the pen occasioned by the following word &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;; for the other course suggested by Bertheau, namely that &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; should be struck out as a gloss, is precluded by the circumstance that there is no possible way of explaining the interpolation of so apparently unsuitable a word into the text. It certainly stood in the text used by the lxx, though they have most foolishly confounded &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, and rendered it &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;.</body></html>
