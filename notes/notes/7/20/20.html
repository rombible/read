At this time the ark was at Bethel (compare <a href="/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>), and not at Shiloh. It is not unlikely that though Shiloh was the chief residence of the ark <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>, yet the tabernacle, being moveable, was, either at stated times, or as occasion required, moved to where the Judge resided, or the congregation assembled (compare <a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>). On the present occasion the ark may have been moved to Bethel for the convenience of proximity to the great national council at Mizpeh. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Jud 20:18-28. The Israelites Lose Forty Thousand.<p>18-28. the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God&#8212;This consultation at Shiloh was right. But they ought to have done it at the commencement of their proceedings. Instead of this, all their plans were formed, and never doubting, it would seem, that the war was just and inevitable, the only subject of their inquiry related to the precedency of the tribes&#8212;a point which it is likely was discussed in the assembly. Had they asked counsel of God sooner, their expedition would have been conducted on a different principle&#8212;most probably by reducing the number of fighting men, as in the case of Gideon's army. As it was, the vast number of volunteers formed an excessive and unwieldy force, unfit for strenuous and united action against a small, compact, and well-directed army. A panic ensued, and the confederate tribes, in two successive engagements, sustained great losses. These repeated disasters (notwithstanding their attack on Benjamin had been divinely authorized) overwhelmed them with shame and sorrow. Led to reflection, they became sensible of their guilt in not repressing their national idolatries, as well as in too proudly relying on their superior numbers and the precipitate rashness of this expedition. Having humbled themselves by prayer and fasting, as well as observed the appointed method of expiating their sins, they were assured of acceptance as well as of victory. The presence and services of Phinehas on this occasion help us to ascertain the chronology thus far, that the date of the occurrence must be fixed shortly after the death of Joshua.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin,....

The Benjaminites assembled together at Gibeah out of their different towns, and "were mustered 26,000 men drawing the sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah they were mustered, 700 picked men" (&#1492;&#1490;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, with the reduplication dropped, like the Hothpael in <a href="/numbers/1-47.htm">Numbers 1:47</a>). "Out of all this people there were 700 picked men, lamed in the right hand, all these (were) slinging with a stone (hitting) at a hair's breadth without fail." These statement are not quite clear. Since, according to the distinct words of <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>, the 700 slingers with their left hands were "out of the whole people," i.e., out of the whole number of fighting men mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>, they cannot be the same as the 700 chosen men referred to in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15</a>, notwithstanding the similarity in the numbers and the expression "chosen men." The obscurity arises chiefly from the word &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15</a>, which is separated by the Masoretic accents from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506; &#1502;, and connected with the previous words: "Beside the inhabitants of Gibeah they (the men of the towns of Benjamin) were mustered." On the other hand, the earlier translators took the clause as a relative one: "Beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were mustered 700 men." And this seems absolutely necessary, because otherwise the following words, "700 picked men," would stand without any connection; whilst we should certainly expect at least to find the cop. vav, if these 700 men were not inhabitants of Gibeah. But even if &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; should be taken as a simple repetition of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, the statement which follows could not be understood in any other way than as referring to the number of the fighting men of Gibeah. There is something striking too in the fact that only Benjaminites "out of the cities" are mentioned, and that emphasis is laid upon this by the repetition of the expression "out of the cities" (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-14.htm">Judges 20:14</a>, <a href="/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15</a>). Some have inferred from this, that the Benjaminites as the rulers had settled in the towns, whilst the Canaanites who had been subdued settled as dependants in the villages (Bertheau); or that the Benjaminites had formed military brotherhoods, the members of which lived unmarried in the towns, and that this may possibly account for the abominable crime to which the inhabitants of Gibeah were addicted, and in relation to which the whole tribe took their part (O. v. Gerlach). But such inferences as these are extremely uncertain, as the cities may be mentioned a potiori for all the places inhabited by this tribe. There is another difficulty in the numbers. According to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-14.htm">Judges 20:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15</a>, the total number of the fighting men of Benjamin amounted to 26,000 and 700, without reckoning Gibeah. But, according to the account of the battle, 25,100 were slain (<a href="/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a>), viz., 18,000 in the principal engagement, 5000 as a gleaning, and 200 in the pursuit, i.e., 25,000 men in all (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-44.htm">Judges 20:44-46</a>), and only 600 were left, who fled into the desert to the rock Rimmon (<a href="/judges/20-47.htm">Judges 20:47</a>). According to these accounts, the whole tribe would have contained only 25,100 + 600  equals  25,700 fighting men, or 25,000 + 600  equals  25,600. Accordingly, in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15</a>, the lxx (Cod. Al. etc.) and Vulgate give only 25,000 men; whilst the rest of the ancient versions have 26,000, in agreement with the Masoretic text. Josephus (Ant. v. 2, 10) also gives the number of fighting men in Benjamin as 25,600, of whom 600 were splendid slingers; but he has merely taken the numbers from Jdg 20:44-47. Now, although mistakes do frequently occur in the numbers given, it is a most improbable supposition that we have a mistake of this kind (26,000 for 25,000) in the instance before us, since even the latter number would not agree with <a href="/judges/20-44.htm">Judges 20:44</a>.; and the assumption, that in <a href="/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a> and <a href="/judges/20-44.htm">Judges 20:44</a>. we have an account of all the Benjaminites who fell, finds no support whatever in the history itself. In the verses referred to we have simply a statement of the number of Benjaminites who fell in the defeat which they sustained on the third day, whereas the victories which they gained on the first and second days could hardly have been obtained without some loss on their part; on the contrary, we may confidently assume that they would not lose less than a thousand men, though these are not mentioned in the brief account before us. The other difference between <a href="/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-44.htm">Judges 20:44-46</a>, viz., that 25,100 are given in the one and 25,000 in the other, may be explained on the simple assumption that we have only the full thousands mentioned in the latter, whilst the exact number is given in the former.
