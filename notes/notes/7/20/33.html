What makes this probable is that Baal-tamar can only have derived its name from some famous, and therefore isolated, palm-tree. Now there was exactly such a palm tree—the well known “Palm of Deborah” (see Note on <a href="/judges/4-5.htm" title="And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.">Judges 4:5</a>)—“between Ramah and Bethel,” and therefore at a little distance from the spot where the roads branch. The place was still called Bathamar in the days of Eusebius and Jerome. The Chaldee rendering, “in the plains of Jericho” (“the palm city,” <a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>), is singularly erroneous.<p><span class= "bld">Out of the meadows of Gibeah.</span>—The word <span class= "ital">maareh, </span>rendered “meadows,” occurs nowhere else. Some derive it from <span class= "ital">arah, </span>“to strip.” The LXX., not understanding it, render it as a name, <span class= "ital">Maraagabe, </span>and in Cod. A (following a different reading), “from the west of Gibeah,” as also does the Vulg. Rashi renders it, “because of the stripping of Gibeah,” and Buxtorf, “after the stripping of Gibeah.” It is, however, clear that the words are in apposition to and in explanation of “out of their places:” The Syriac and Arabic understand <span class= "ital">maareh </span>to mean “a cave” or “caves,” printing it <span class= "ital">maarah </span>instead of <span class= "ital">maareh. </span>Similarly the reading “from the west” only involves the change of a single letter (<span class= "ital">maarab</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>If the text be left unaltered, the “meadows” may have been concealed from the town by intervening rocks. In <a href="/isaiah/19-7.htm" title="The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.">Isaiah 19:7</a> <span class= "ital">aroth </span>mean “pastures.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.

According to its etymology, it ought to mean a "bare open place", which is particularly unsuitable for an ambush.

Jerom (w) speaks of a little village in his time in those parts, called Bethamari, and may be thought to be this same place; perhaps in the times of the old Canaanites here was a grove of palm trees, in which Baal was worshipped, from whence it had its name: <p>and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah; or plain of Gibeah, as the Targum; for as the city was built on a hill, at the bottom of it were a plain and fine meadows of grass, and here an ambush was placed at some little distance from the city; and when the army of the Benjaminites were drawn off from it, in pursuit of Israel, these came forth and placed themselves between them and the city. <p>(w) De loc.

But the language of the verse does not inspire confidence in its originality (lit. <span class="ital">the men of Israel rose up from his place</span>!); on the other hand the mention of Baal-tamar may well be ancient. Perhaps we may describe this half-verse as an early addition.

The narrative is singularly obscure and broken, and difficult to follow. But the meaning seems to be, that when the Israelite army had reached Baal-tamar in their flight, they suddenly stopped and formed to give battle to the pursuing Benjamites. And at the same time the liers in wait came out from their ambushment and placed themselves in the rear of the Benjamites on the direct road to Gibeah. <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span>-<span class="cmt_word">tamar</span>, a place of palm trees.

The meaning of the word <span class="accented">maareh</span> is thought to be a bare tract of ground without trees - something like a heath or common. It may have had pits, or deep depressions, where the ambush would be hid both from the city itself and from the high road, or other facilities for concealment. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Having made these preparations, they inquired of the Lord whether they should continue the war, and received this reply: "Go up (against Benjamin); for to-morrow I will give it unto thy hand" (&#1497;&#1491;&#1498;, the hand of the congregation carrying on the war). To this the supplementary remark is appended, that the ark of the covenant was at Bethel in those days, and the high priest served before it. The expression "in those days" implies that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel, and therefore had been brought thither from the tabernacle at Shiloh during this war. </body></html>
