The result of the Benjamites finding themselves between the ambushment and the army of Israel was that they took to flight in an easterly direction (ver. 43) toward the wilderness, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wilderness described in <a href="/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a> as "the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel," where the direction of the wilderness relative to Ephraim is also described as being "on the east." In like manner Zedekiah fled towards the plain (<span class="accented">arabah</span>) or plains of Jericho - a term nearly synonymous with <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Them which came out of the cities</span>, etc. This is a very obscure passage, and is very variously explained. <span class="accented">Those which came out</span> of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">cities</span> must be the same as are so described in ver. 15, and designates the Benjamites who were not inhabitants of Gibeah. The simplest way, therefore, to understand the passage is to render it without reference to the accents: "And the battle overtook him and those that were from the cities (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Gibeah and the rest of the Benjamites), destroying him (the whole Benjamite army) in the midst of him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> going right into the midst of them, and destroying right and left. Some, however, render it <span class="accented">in the midst of it</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the wilderness. The plural participle <span class="accented">destroying</span> agrees with the singular noun of multitude, <span class="accented">the battle</span> or <span class="accented">war</span>, meaning <span class="accented">all the men of war.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Benjaminites, for instance, saw (this is the proper rendering of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; with vav consec., which merely indicates the order of thought, not that of time) that they were beaten, and the man of Israel vacated the field before Benjamin (&#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, to give place by falling back and flying), because they relied upon the ambush which they had placed against Gibeah. The Benjaminites did not perceive this till the ambush fell upon their rear. But the ambush itself, as is added in <a href="/judges/20-37.htm">Judges 20:37</a> by way of further explanation, hastened and fell (fell as quickly as possible) into Gibeah, and went thither and smote the whole town with the edge of the sword. To this there is added the further explanation in <a href="/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38</a> : "And the arrangement of the Israelites with the ambush was this: multiply, to cause smoke-rising to ascend (i.e., cause a great cloud of smoke to ascend) out of the city." The only objection that can be raised to this view of &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;, as the imperative Hiphil of &#1512;&#1489;&#1492;, is the suffix &#1501;-attached to &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, since this is unsuitable to a direct address. This suffix can only be explained by supposing that there is an admixture of two constructions, the direct appeal, and the indirect explanation, that they were to cause to ascend. If this be not admitted, however, we can only follow Studer, and erase the suffix as an error of the pen occasioned by the following word &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;; for the other course suggested by Bertheau, namely that &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; should be struck out as a gloss, is precluded by the circumstance that there is no possible way of explaining the interpolation of so apparently unsuitable a word into the text. It certainly stood in the text used by the lxx, though they have most foolishly confounded &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; with &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, and rendered it &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;.</body></html>
