The sling is the natural weapon of a people which is poor and imperfectly armed. Cyrus valued his force of 400 slingers (Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. iii.</span> 3-6). The inhabitants of the Balearic Isles were as skilful as the Benjamites, and children were trained to sling their breakfasts down from the top of high poles. They once prevented the Carthaginian fleet from coming to anchor by showers of stones (liv. xxviii. 37, <span class= "ital">solo eo telo utebantur</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Practice made them so expert that the stones they slung came with as much force as though hurled by a catapult, and pierced shields and helmets (Diod. Sic. <span class= "ital">Bibl. </span>v. 18). Exactly similar tales are told of the trained skill of our English archers.

This extraordinary skill in their arms (for it is likely they handled other weapons with the like dexterity) and their natural courage, imboldened the Benjamites with such a small number to undertake a war against such a vast multitude of their brethren, the other Israelites; which warlike disposition of theirs was foretold by Jacob, for he said of them, when he spake of the character and fortune of each tribe, (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm" title="Benjamin shall shred as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.">Genesis 49:27</a>,) <span class="ital">Benjamin shall raven as a wolf, </span>which is an undaunted, fearless creature. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:7-13 Micah thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images, that a Levite should come to his door.

The Hebrew sling was probably similar to that of the Egyptian, consisting of a leather thong, broad in the middle, with a loop at one end, by which it was firmly held with the hand; the other end terminated in a lash, which was let slip when the stone was thrown. Those skilled in the use of it, as the Benjamites were, could hit the mark with unerring certainty. A good sling could carry its full force to the distance of two hundred yards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Left-handed, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">shut up on their right hand</span>, i.e. using their left hand instead of their right. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss; </span> an hyperbolical expression, signifying that they could do this with great exactness. There are many parallel instances in historians of persons that could throw stones or shoot arrows with great certainty, so as seldom or never to miss; of which see my Latin Synopsis. And this was very considerable, and one ground of the Benjamites’ confidence, because in those times they had no guns. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded,.... According to Ben Gersom, these were the seven hundred men of Gibeah; but this does not appear from the text, but, on the contrary, that these were among all the people; or there were so many to be selected out of them all, who were lefthanded men; nor is it likely that all the inhabitants of one place should be such. Benjamin signifies a son of the right hand, yet this tribe had a great number of lefthanded men in it, see <a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>. Josephus (h) wrongly reduces the number to five hundred: <p>everyone could sling stones at an hair's breadth, and not miss: the mark they slung the stone at, so very expert were they at it; and perhaps their having such a number of skilful men in this art made them more confident of success, and emboldened them in this daring undertaking, to point to which this circumstance seems to be mentioned. There were a people that inhabited the islands, now called Majorca and Minorca, anciently Baleares, from their skilfulness in slinging stones, to which they brought up from their childhood, as it is related various writers, Strabo (i), Diodorus Siculus (k), Floras (l) and others (m); that their mothers used to set their breakfast on a beam or post, or some such thing, at a distance, which they were not to have, unless they could strike it off; and the first of these writers says, that they exercised this art from the time that the Phoenicians held these islands; and, according to Pliny (n), the Phoenicians, the old inhabitants of Canaan, were the first inventors of slings, and from these the Benjaminites might learn it. The Indians are said (o) to be very expert in slinging stones to an hair's breadth. <p>(h) Antiqu. l. 5. c. 2. sect. 10. (i) Geograph l. 3. p. 116. (k) Bibliothec. l. 5. p. 298.

Then, keeping the text of this <span class="ital">v.</span> as it stands, we are told that the Benjamite host included a company of 700 left-handed and exceptionally skilful warriors, just as David’s army was strengthened by a similar band, <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>. Josephus understood the narrative in this way, <span class="ital">Ant.</span> <a href="/judges/20-2.htm" title="And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.">Jdg 20:2</a>; <a href="/judges/20-10.htm" title="And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.">Jdg 20:10</a>. The alternative is to omit the first half of this verse, and make the 700 chosen men refer to the inhabitants of Gibeah, and <span class="ital">every one</span> (rather, <span class="ital">all this</span> army) <span class="ital">could sling … and not miss</span> refer to the entire host. But this does not seem natural, and to cut out <span class="ital">left-handed</span> as merely borrowed from <a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Jdg 3:15</a> is to remove a feature which has the appearance of originality.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven hundred...  men left-handed</span>. It is curious that the tribe of Benjamin, which means <span class="accented">son of the right hand</span>, should have this peculiar institution of a corps of left-handed men. Ehud the Benjamite was <span class="accented">a man left-handed</span> (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>; see also <a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). The Roman name <span class="accented">Scaexola</span> means <span class="accented">left-handed.</span> For the use of the sling see <a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40, 49</a>. Diodorus Siculus (quoted by Rosenmuller) mentions the remarkable skill of the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands in the use of the sling, adding, in terms very similar to those of the text, that they seldom miss their aim. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then all the people rose up as one man, saying, "We will not any of us go into his tent, neither will we any of us return to his house," sc., till this crime is punished. The sentence follows in <a href="/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9</a> : "This is the thing that we will do," i.e., this is the way in which we will treat Gibeah: "against it by lot" (sc., we will act). The Syriac gives the sense correctly - We will cast lots upon it; but the lxx quite erroneously supply &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; (we will go up); and in accordance with this, many expositors connect the words with <a href="/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a> in the following sense: "We will choose one man out of every ten by lot, to supply the army with the necessary provision during the expedition." This is quite a mistake, because in this way a subordinate point, which only comes into consideration in connection with the execution of the sentence, would be made the chief point, and the sentence itself would not be given at all. The words "against it by lot" contain the resolution that was formed concerning the sinful town, and have all the enigmatical brevity of judicial sentences, and are to be explained from the course laid down in the Mosaic law with regard to the Canaanites, who were to be exterminated, and their land divided by lot among the Israelites. Consequently the meaning is simply this: "Let us proceed with the lot against Gibeah," i.e., let us deal with it as with the towns of the Canaanites, conquer it, lay it in ashes, and distribute its territory by lot. In <a href="/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a> a subordinate circumstance is mentioned, which was necessary to enable them to carry out the resolution that had been made. As the assembled congregation had determined to keep together for the purpose of carrying on war (<a href="/judges/20-8.htm">Judges 20:8</a>), it was absolutely necessary that resources should be provided for those who were actively engaged in the war. For this purpose they chose one man in every ten "to fetch provision for the people," &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;, "that they might do on their coming to Gibeah of Benjamin according to all the folly which had been done in Israel," i.e., might punish the wickedness in Gibeah as it deserved.</body></html>
