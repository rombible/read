Evil pursues sinners, and sometimes overtakes them, when not only at ease, but triumphant. Though wickedness may prosper a while, it will not prosper always. The history of mankind, if truly told, would greatly resemble that of this chapter. The records of what are called splendid events present to us such contests for power. Such scenes, though praised of men, fully explain the Scripture doctrine of the deceitfulness and desperate wickedness of the human heart, the force of men's lust, and the effect of Satan's influence.

The word here used means the <span class="accented">upper millstone</span>, which <span class="accented">rides</span> as it were, or moves, over the fixed nether stone. <span class="cmt_word">All to brake his skull</span>. This obsolete English phrase has been the subject of a recent controversy. In the older English of Chaucer and his immediate successors such compounds as <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> were very common, and were frequently preceded by the adverb <span class="accented">all.</span> Hence, some English scholars would read the phrase here, <span class="accented">and all to-brake his skull.</span> It is, however, certain that before the time when the A.V. was made the compounds <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> had become entirely obsolete, and the compound <span class="accented">all-to</span> had come into use. The right way, therefore, in which to read the present phrase <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="accented">and all-to brake his skull</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> smashed it, dashed it in pieces. The prefix <span class="accented">all-to</span> gives intensity to the verb. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As soon as this was announced to Abimelech, he went with all his men to Mount Zalmon, took hatchets in his hand, cut down branches from the trees, and laid them upon his shoulders, and commanded his people to do the same. These branches they laid upon the hold, and set the hold on fire over them (the inhabitants of the tower who had taken refuge there), so that all the people of the tower of Shechem (about one thousand persons) perished, both men and women. Mount Zalmon, which is mentioned again in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-15.htm">Psalm 68:15</a>, was a dark, thickly-wooded mountain near Shechem, - a kind of "Black Forest," as Luther has rendered the name.
