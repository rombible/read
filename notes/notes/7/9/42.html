Upon which he hastily took his army, divided them as before into three companies, lay in ambush in the field till the Shechemites were well out in the country, then attacked the Shechemites in the field with two of the companies, and himself at the head of the third rushed to the city gate to intercept their retreat. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Gaal went out in the morning with his retinue upon some enterprise, which is not more clearly defined, and stood before the city gate, Abimelech rose up with his army out of the ambush.
