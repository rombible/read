The Chaldee renders Millo by “a rampart;” and if this be correct, the “house of the rampart” was perhaps the same as the “tower of Shechem” (<a href="/context/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Judges 9:46-49</a>). There was a Millo on Mount Zion (<a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm" title="So David dwelled in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.">2Samuel 5:9</a>), which was also called a Beth Millo (<a href="/2_kings/12-21.htm" title="For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.">2Kings 12:21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Made Abimelech king.</span>—He was the first Israelite who ever bore that name. It does not appear that this royalty was recognised beyond the limits of Ephraim. Gideon had not only refused the title of king (<span class= "ital">melek</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but even the title of ruler (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm" title="And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.">Judges 8:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">By the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">near the terebinth of the monument which is in Shechem. </span>The word rendered “by” is <span class= "ital">im, </span>which properly means <span class= "ital">with, </span>but may mean “near,” as in <a href="/genesis/25-11.htm" title="And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelled by the well Lahairoi.">Genesis 25:11</a>. The word rendered “the pillar” is <span class= "ital">mutsabh, </span>which the Syriac and Arabic versions take for a proper name, and the Chaldee renders “the corn-field” or <span class= "ital">“</span>statue.” Luther renders it the <span class= "ital">“</span>lofty oak,” and the Vulg. follows another reading. The LXX. take it to mean <span class= "ital">“</span>a garrison” (LXX., <span class= "ital">stasis</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which is the meaning it has in <a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm" title="And I will camp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you.">Isaiah 29:3</a>; but as the terebinth is doubtless that under which Joshua had raised his “stone of witness” (<a href="/joshua/24-26.htm" title="And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.">Joshua 24:26</a>), the <span class= "ital">mutsabh </span>is perhaps a name for this stone. If so, the neighbourhood of that pledge of faithfulness would add audacity to his acts. There can be little doubt that the terebinth was the celebrated tree under which Jacob had made his family bury their idolatrous earrings and amulets (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>), and the terebinth (E.V., <span class= "ital">plain</span>) of Moreh, near Shechem, under which Abraham had spread his tent and where he had built an altar (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>). Possibly, too, it may be the “terebinth of the enchanters” mentioned in <a href="/judges/9-37.htm" title="And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.">Judges 9:37</a>.

Millo must have been some strongly fortified post in the neighbourhood of Shechem, and no doubt the place where the tower was, mentioned in vers. 46, 47. At Jerusalem we read of <span class="accented">Millo</span> as a part of the city of David in <a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>, apparently so called by the Jebusites, and the strengthening of it was one of Solomon's great works (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15, 24</a>). It is called <span class="accented">the house of Millo</span> in <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>, where it is mentioned as the scene of the murder of King Joash. Here, therefore, <span class="accented">the house of Millo</span> probably means the citadel or keep of Sechem, a fortress analogous to the Bala-hissar in relation to Cabul, though possibly at a distance of a mile or two (ver 46, note). The phrase, <span class="accented">all the house of Millo</span>, means all the men who dwelt in the house of Millo, probably all men of war. <span class="cmt_word">Made Abimelech king</span>. We seem to see the hand of the Canaanite population in this term king, which was proper to the Canaanites (<a href="/joshua/11.htm">Joshua 11, 12</a>.), but was not yet domesticated in Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The plain of the pillar</span>. This translation is clearly wrong. The word translated <span class="accented">plain</span> means an oak or <span class="accented">terebinth tree.</span> The word translated <span class="accented">pillar</span> is thought to mean a <span class="accented">garrison</span>, or <span class="accented">military post</span>, in <a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a> (A.V. <span class="accented">mound</span>); but, according to its etymology and the meaning of other forms of the same root, may equally well mean a monument, or stone set up and this is probably the meaning here. The translation will then be <span class="accented">the oak of the monument</span>, a sense supported by the modern names of the mosque there, of which one is "the Oak of Moreh," and another "the Saint of the Pillar" (see Stanley's 'Sermons in. the East,' p. 182). And we are very strongly led to this conclusion by the further fact that there was a famous oak at Shechem, mentioned <a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a> as the place where Jacob hid the idols of his household; and that Joshua took a great stone and "set it up under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord" at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25, 26</a>). It marks a sad declension in the condition of Israel at this time, as compared with the days of Joshua, that the Shechemite Abimelech should be made king with a view to the restoration of Baal-worship on the very spot where theft fathers had made a solemn covenant to serve the Lord. It is remarkable that the narrative in this chapter gives us no clue as to the relations of the rest of Israel with Abimelech. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 9:7-21 <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this relapse into the worship of Baal they not only forgot Jehovah, their Deliverer from all their foes, but also the benefits which they owed to Gideon, and showed no kindness to his house in return for all the good which he had shown to Israel.
