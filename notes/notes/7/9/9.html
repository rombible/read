To undertake “the government of others,” says Henry, “involves a man in a great deal of both toil and care. He that is promoted over the trees must go up and down for them, and make himself a perfect drudge to business. Those that are preferred to places of public trust and power, must resolve to forego all their private interests and advantages, and sacrifice them to the good of the community.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:7-21 There was no occasion for the trees to choose a king, they are all the trees of the Lord which he has planted. Nor was there any occasion for Israel to set a king over them, for the Lord was their King. Those who bear fruit for the public good, are justly respected and honoured by all that are wise, more than those who merely make a figure. All these fruit-trees gave much the same reason for their refusal to be promoted over the trees; or, as the margin reads it, to go up and down for the trees. To rule, involves a man in a great deal both of toil and care. Those who are preferred to public trust and power, must forego all private interests and advantages, for the good of others. And those advanced to honour and dignity, are in great danger of losing their fruitfulness. For which reason, they that desire to do good, are afraid of being too great. Jotham compares Abimelech to the bramble or thistle, a worthless plant, whose end is to be burned.

Eastern people are exceedingly fond of parables and use them for conveying reproofs, which they could not give in any other way. The top of Gerizim is not so high in the rear of the town, as it is nearer to the plain. With a little exertion of voice, he could easily have been heard by the people of the city; for the hill so overhangs the valley, that a person from the side or summit would have no difficulty in speaking to listeners at the base. Modern history records a case, in which soldiers on the hill shouted to the people in the city and endeavored to instigate them to an insurrection.

A, Peshitto A staple article of man’s daily food, oil was offered as sacrificial food to the gods, and among the Hebrews to Jehovah. But oil was not an article of food by itself; accordingly in Hebr. ritual it was not poured out as a libation, but used to moisten and enrich a cereal offering (<a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1</a> ff.; <a href="/exodus/29-23.htm" title="And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:">Exodus 29:23</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-40.htm" title="And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.">Exodus 29:40</a>)1[40] Further, a guest was anointed as a sign of honour and festivity (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/141-5.htm" title="Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.">Psalm 141:5</a>; cf. the anointing of a king and priest); on this analogy we may explain the ancient custom of pouring oil upon sacred stones (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a> E, <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm" title="And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.">Genesis 35:14</a> J; cf. the smearing of sacred furniture <a href="/exodus/30-24.htm" title="And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:">Exodus 30:24</a> ff.
