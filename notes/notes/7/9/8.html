Fables are extremely popular in the East, where they are often current, under the name of the slave-philosopher Lokman, the counterpart of the Greek Æsop. But though there are many apologues and parables in Scripture (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the Old Testament, “the ewe lamb,” <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.">2Samuel 12:1-4</a>; Psalms 80; <a href="/context/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1-6</a>, &c), there is only one other “fable,” and that is one closely akin to this (<a href="/2_kings/14-9.htm" title="And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and stepped down the thistle.">2Kings 14:9</a>). St. Paul, however, in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="For the body is not one member, but many.">1Corinthians 12:14-19</a>, evidently refers to the ancient fable of Menenius Agrippa, about the belly and the members (Liv. 2:30). A “fable” is a fanciful story, to inculcate prudential morality. In the Bible “trees” seem to be more favourite <span class= "ital">dramatis personœ </span>than the talking birds and beasts of other nations. “Went forth” is the emphatic phrase “going, they went.” The scenery immediately around Jotham would furnish the most striking illustration of his words, for it is more umbrageous than any other in Palestine, and Shechem seems to rise out of a sea of living verdure. The aptitude for keen and proverbial speech seems to have been hereditary in his family (Joash, <a href="/judges/6-31.htm" title="And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will you plead for Baal? will you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar.">Judges 6:31</a>; Gideon, <a href="/judges/8-2.htm" title="And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?">Judges 8:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To anoint a king over them.</span>—Evidently the thought of royalty was, so to speak, <span class= "ital">“</span>in the air.” It is interesting to find from this passing allusion that the custom of “anointing” a king must have prevailed among the neighbouring nations.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the olive tree.</span>—This venerable and fruitful tree, with its silvery leaves and its grey cloud-like appearance at a distance, and its peculiar value and fruitfulness, would naturally first occur to the trees.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/9-8.htm" title="The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.">Jdg 9:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">The trees went forth on a time — </span>This is the first instance that we have of this manner of speaking by parables. But we find it in great use afterward, and frequently adopted, not by prophets only, but by courtiers, politicians, and soldiers, in the Old Testament. See <a href="/2_samuel/14-1.htm" title="Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.">2 Samuel 14:1</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/20-38.htm" title="So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes on his face.">1 Kings 20:38</a>; chap. <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a>. <span class="ital">To anoint a king over them — </span>Kings were appointed among the Israelites, and some other nations, with the ceremony of anointing. <span class="ital">Olive-tree — </span>By which he means Gideon.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:7-21 There was no occasion for the trees to choose a king, they are all the trees of the Lord which he has planted. Nor was there any occasion for Israel to set a king over them, for the Lord was their King. Those who bear fruit for the public good, are justly respected and honoured by all that are wise, more than those who merely make a figure. All these fruit-trees gave much the same reason for their refusal to be promoted over the trees; or, as the margin reads it, to go up and down for the trees. To rule, involves a man in a great deal both of toil and care. Those who are preferred to public trust and power, must forego all private interests and advantages, for the good of others. And those advanced to honour and dignity, are in great danger of losing their fruitfulness. For which reason, they that desire to do good, are afraid of being too great. Jotham compares Abimelech to the bramble or thistle, a worthless plant, whose end is to be burned. Such a one was Abimelech.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This fable and that noted in the marginal reference are the only two of the kind found in Scripture.

Jotham by a Parable Reproaches Them.<p>7. he &#8230; stood in the top of mount Gerizim and lifted up his voice&#8212;The spot he chose was, like the housetops, the public place of Shechem; and the parable [Jud 9:8-15] drawn from the rivalry of the various trees was appropriate to the diversified foliage of the valley below. Eastern people are exceedingly fond of parables and use them for conveying reproofs, which they could not give in any other way. The top of Gerizim is not so high in the rear of the town, as it is nearer to the plain. With a little exertion of voice, he could easily have been heard by the people of the city; for the hill so overhangs the valley, that a person from the side or summit would have no difficulty in speaking to listeners at the base. Modern history records a case, in which soldiers on the hill shouted to the people in the city and endeavored to instigate them to an insurrection. There is something about the elastic atmosphere of an Eastern clime which causes it to transmit sound with wonderful celerity and distinctness [Hackett].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A parabolical discourse, usual among the ancients, especially in the eastern parts; wherein, under the names of trees, men are represented. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To anoint a king, </span> i.e. to make a king, which was oft done among the Israelites, and some others, with the ceremony of anointing.

This is an apologue or fable, and a very fine and beautiful one; it is fitly expressed to answer the design, and the most ancient of the kind, being made seven hundred years before the times of Aesop, so famous for his fables, and exceeds anything written by him. By the trees are meant the people of Israel in general, and the Shechemites in particular, who had been for some time very desirous of a king, but could not persuade any of their great and good men to accept of that office: <p>and they said unto the olive tree, reign thou over us; a fit emblem of a good man, endowed with excellent virtues and qualifications for good, as David king of Israel, who is compared to such a tree, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, Jarchi applies this to Othniel the first judge; but it may be better applied to Gideon, an excellent good man, full of fruits of righteousness, and eminently useful, and to whom kingly government was offered, and was refused by him; and the men of Shechem could scarcely fail of thinking of him, and applying it to him, as Jotham was delivering his fable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{e}</span> The trees went forth <i>on a time</i> to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</span><p>(e) By this parable he declares that those that are not ambitious, are most worthy of honour and that the ambitious abuse their honour both to their own destruction and others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">The trees went forth</span>] Cf. <a href="/2_kings/14-9.htm" title="And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and stepped down the thistle.">2 Kings 14:9</a>. Fables of trees that speak and act like human beings spring from the instinct for personification, which is a characteristic of an early stage of civilization; they were current not only among the Hebrews, but among the Babylonians and Assyrians. Part of a fable of this kind, taking the form of a dispute between the trees, has been discovered in the library of Ashurbanipal. Baudissin, <span class="ital">Adonis u. Esmun</span>, p. 436.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the olive</span>] comes first, as being the most valuable and highly prized of the trees of Palestine. The olive, the vine and the fig are the staple products of the Judaean range. See G. A. Smith, <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, i. p. 299.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The trees</span>, etc. This is the earliest example of a <span class="accented">fable</span> in Scripture; indeed the only one except that in <a href="/2_kings/14-9.htm">2 Kings 14:9</a>. It is remarked that in the Indian and Greek fables the animals are the <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span>, the fox, the lion, the ass, etc.; whereas in the only two specimens of Hebrew fable remaining to us, the members of the vegetable kingdom, the olive, the fig, the vine, the bramble, the cedar, the thistle, are the actors and speakers. The <span class="accented">parable</span>, of which <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a> is a beautiful example, is quite different in its structure. Like the inimitable parables of our Saviour in the New Testament, it sets forth Divine troth under an image, but the image and all its parts are in strict accordance with nature. In the Scripture <span class="accented">allegory</span> real persons and their actions prefigure the actions and the persons which they are intended to represent (see <a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39, 40</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21-31</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). Allegorical personages may, however, be fictitious, as in the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' The general meaning of this fable is clear. The trees worthy to reign for their intrinsic excellence refused the proffered kingdom one after another. The vilest and most unworthy accepted it. The result would be that a fire would burst out from the despicable bramble, and set fire to the lofty cedar tree. Thus Gideon refused the kingdom, and his sons had virtually refused it likewise. The base-born Abimelech had accepted it, and the result would be a deadly strife, which would destroy both the ungrateful subjects and the unworthy ruler. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Having gone to Shechem, the home of his mother (<a href="/judges/8-31.htm">Judges 8:31</a>), Abimelech applied to his mother's brothers and the whole family (all the relations) of the father's house of his mother, and addressed them thus: "Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the lords of Shechem," i.e., speak to them publicly and solemnly. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, the lords, i.e., the possessors or citizens of Shechem (compare <a href="/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm">Judges 9:49</a>, where &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; is interchangeable with &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; a; also <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/20-5.htm">Judges 20:5</a>, and <a href="/joshua/24-11.htm">Joshua 24:11</a>): they are not merely Canaanitish citizens, of whom there were some still living in Shechem according to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-28.htm">Judges 9:28</a>, but all the citizens of the town; therefore chiefly Israelites. "What is better for you, that seventy men rule over you, all the sons of Jerubbaal, or (only) one man (i.e., Abimelech)? and remember that I am your flesh and bone" (blood relation, <a href="/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>). The name "sons of Jerubbaal," i.e., of the man who had destroyed the altar of Baal, was just as little adapted to commend the sons of Gideon to the Shechemites, who were devoted to the worship of Baal, as the remark that seventy men were to rule over them. No such rule ever existed, or was even aspired to by the seventy sons of Gideon. But Abimelech assumed that his brothers possessed the same thirst for ruling as he did himself; and the citizens of Shechem might be all the more ready to put faith in his assertions, since the distinction which Gideon had enjoyed was thoroughly adapted to secure a prominent place in the nation for his sons.</body></html>
