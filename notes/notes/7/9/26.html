Who this Gaal was, and who his brethren, and from whence he came, and the place he went over, are all uncertain. Jarchi thinks he was a Gentile, and it looks, by some speeches of his afterwards, as if he was a descendant of Hamor, prince of Shechem, in the times of Jacob, who, since the expulsion of the Canaanites, his family had retired to some distant parts; but hearing of a difference between Abimelech and the Shechemites, Gaal, with some of the family, came over, perhaps over Jordan, to make what advantage he could of it: <p>and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him; freely told him their mind, the ill opinion they had of Abimelech, and what was their design against him; and he assuring them he would take their part, and defend them to the uttermost, they depended on him, and therefore very securely went about their business in the fields, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>26–41. <span class="ital">Gaal stirs up the Shechemites: Abimelech defeats them<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span><span class="bld">26</span><span class="ital">.</span> <span class="ital">Gaal the son of Ebed</span>] i.e. <span class="ital">of a slave</span>; but pronounce throughout <span class="ital">Obed</span>, with LXX. cod.

Who he was, or of what tribe or race he and his brethren were, we have no means of knowing; he seems to have been an adventurer who sought to turn the growing disaffection of the Shechemites to his own advantage by offering himself as a leader of the malcontents.

These verses form a long period, the first half of which is so extended by the insertion of parentheses introduced as explanations (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-17.htm">Judges 9:17</a>, <a href="/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>), that the commencement of it (<a href="/judges/9-16.htm">Judges 9:16</a>) is taken up again in <a href="/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a> for the purpose of attaching the apodosis. "If ye have acted in truth and sincerity, and (i.e., when he) made Abimelech king; if ye have done well to Jerubbaal and his house, and if ye have done to him according to the doing of his hands ... as my father fought for you ... but ye have risen up to-day against my father's house, and have slain ... if (I say) ye have acted in truth and sincerity to Jerubbaal and his house this day: then rejoice in Abimelech ...." &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, to throw away his life, i.e., expose to death. &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;, "from before him," serves to strengthen the &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;. Jotham imputes the slaying of his brothers to the citizens of Shechem, as a crime which they themselves had committed (<a href="/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>), because they had given Abimelech money out of their temple of Baal to carry out his designs against the sons of Jerubbaal (<a href="/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>). In this reproach he had, strictly speaking, already pronounced sentence upon their doings. When, therefore, he proceeds still further in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a>, "If ye have acted in truth towards Jerubbaal ... then rejoice," etc., this turn contains the bitterest scorn at the faithlessness manifested towards Jerubbaal. In that case nothing could follow but the fulfilment of the threat and the bursting forth of the fire. In carrying out this point the application goes beyond the actual meaning of the parable itself. Not only will fire go forth from Abimelech and consume the lords of Shechem and the inhabitants of Millo, but fire will also go forth from them and devour Abimelech himself. The fulfilment of this threat was not long delayed, as the following history shows (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23</a>.). </body></html>
