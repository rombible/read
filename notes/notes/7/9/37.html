R. Isaiah interprets it, between the two cities: <p>and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim; of which we read nowhere else. Montanus renders it, "the oak of Meonenim"; or of the soothsayers; oaks being had in great esteem with idolaters for their oracles and divinations; and perhaps this was a place, whether an oak or, a plain, where such persons used to meet to make their divinations. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">37</span>. <span class="ital">the middle of the land</span>] <span class="bld">the Navel of the land</span>; this is the traditional meaning of the word, Talm., LXX <span class="greekheb">ὀμφαλός</span>, Vulgate umbilicus.
