Nor was there any occasion for Israel to set a king over them, for the Lord was their King. Those who bear fruit for the public good, are justly respected and honoured by all that are wise, more than those who merely make a figure. All these fruit-trees gave much the same reason for their refusal to be promoted over the trees; or, as the margin reads it, to go up and down for the trees. To rule, involves a man in a great deal both of toil and care. Those who are preferred to public trust and power, must forego all private interests and advantages, for the good of others. And those advanced to honour and dignity, are in great danger of losing their fruitfulness. For which reason, they that desire to do good, are afraid of being too great. Jotham compares Abimelech to the bramble or thistle, a worthless plant, whose end is to be burned. Such a one was Abimelech.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Honour God and man - Alluding to the constant use of oil in the meat-offerings <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-16</a>, and in the holy ointment <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-24.htm">Exodus 30:24-25</a>.

Jotham by a Parable Reproaches Them.<p>7. he &#8230; stood in the top of mount Gerizim and lifted up his voice&#8212;The spot he chose was, like the housetops, the public place of Shechem; and the parable [Jud 9:8-15] drawn from the rivalry of the various trees was appropriate to the diversified foliage of the valley below. Eastern people are exceedingly fond of parables and use them for conveying reproofs, which they could not give in any other way. The top of Gerizim is not so high in the rear of the town, as it is nearer to the plain. With a little exertion of voice, he could easily have been heard by the people of the city; for the hill so overhangs the valley, that a person from the side or summit would have no difficulty in speaking to listeners at the base. Modern history records a case, in which soldiers on the hill shouted to the people in the city and endeavored to instigate them to an insurrection. There is something about the elastic atmosphere of an Eastern clime which causes it to transmit sound with wonderful celerity and distinctness [Hackett].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said the trees unto the vine,.... Another emblem of good and useful men; and it may be observed, that Jotham takes no notice of any trees but fruitful ones till he comes to the bramble, and them only such as were well known, and of the greatest use, in the land of Judea, as olives, figs, and vines, see <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>. <p>come thou, and reign over us; this Jarchi applies to Gideon; but since there are three sorts of trees brought into the fable, and when the kingdom was offered to Gideon, it was proposed to him, and to his son, and his son's son, and refused, some reference may be had unto it in this apologue. Abarbinel thinks three sorts of men are intended as proper persons for rule and government, as honourable ones, such as are wealthy and rich, and also of good behaviour to God and man, as Gideon's sons were; but Abimelech was all the reverse. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">the vine</span>] The old phrase ‘to sit each under his vine and fig-tree,’ denoting peaceful occupation of the land, shews how widely spread and ancient was the cultivation of the vine in Palestine; <a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm" title="And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.">1 Kings 4:25</a>, <a href="/micah/4-4.htm" title="But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken it.">Micah 4:4</a> etc.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then all the citizens of Shechem assembled together, and all the house of Millo, and made Abimelech king at the memorial terebinth at Shechem." Millo is unquestionably the name of the castle or citadel of the town of Shechem, which is called the tower of Shechem in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46-49</a>. The word Millo (Chaldee &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;) signifies primarily a rampart, inasmuch as it consisted of two walls, with the space between them filled with rubbish. There was also a Millo at Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>). "All the house of Millo" are all the inhabitants of the castle, the same persons who are described in <a href="/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a> as "all the men (baale) of the tower." The meaning of &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; is doubtful. &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, the thing set up, is a military post in <a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>; but it may also mean a monument of memorial, and here it probably denotes the large stone set up as a memorial at Shechem under the oak or terebinth (see <a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>). The inhabitants of Shechem, the worshippers of Baal-berith, carried out the election of Abimelech as king in the very same place in which Joshua had held the last national assembly, and had renewed the covenant of Israel with Jehovah the true covenant God (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25-26</a>). It was there in all probability that the temple of Baal-berith was to be found, namely, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a>, near the tower of Shechem or the citadel of Millo. </body></html>
