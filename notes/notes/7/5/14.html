We may conjecture that Judah and Simeon were sufficiently occupied in keeping off the Philistines, or that, having secured their own territory, they remained in selfish isolation.

He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render "Of Ephraim (Deborah's own tribe) came down those whose root is in Mount Amalek <a href="/judges/12-15.htm">Judges 12:15</a>; after thee (O Ephraim) came Benjamin among thy people; of Machir (the west-Jordanic milies of Manasseh.

Israel forsook its God and creator, and chose new gods, i.e., gods not worshipped by its fathers (vid., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>). Then there was war (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, the construct state of &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, a verbal noun formed from the Piel, and signifying conflict or war) at the gates; i.e., the enemy pressed up to the very gates of the Israelitish towns, and besieged them, and there was not seen a shield or spear among forty thousand in Israel, i.e., there were no warriors found in Israel who ventured to defend the land against the foe. &#1488;&#1501; indicates a question with a negative reply assumed, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-27.htm">1 Kings 1:27</a>, etc. Shield and spear (or lance) are mentioned particularly as arms of offence and defence, to signify arms of all kinds. The words are not to be explained from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>, as signifying that there were no longer any weapons to be found among the Israelites, because the enemy had taken them away ("not seen" is not equivalent to "not found" in <a href="/1_samuel/13-22.htm">1 Samuel 13:22</a>); they simply affirm that there were no longer any weapons to be seen, because not one of the 40,000 men in Israel took a weapon in his hand. The number 40,000 is not the number of the men who offered themselves willingly for battle, according to <a href="/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2</a> (Bertheau); for apart from the fact that they did not go unarmed into the battle, it is at variance with the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-10.htm">Judges 4:10</a>, that Barak went into the war and smote the enemy with only 10,000 men. It is a round number, i.e., an approximative statement of the number of the warriors who might have smitten the enemy and delivered Israel from bondage, and was probably chosen with a reference to the 40,000 fighting men of the tribes on the east of the Jordan, who went with Joshua to Canaan and helped their brethren to conquer the land (<a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>). Most of the more recent expositors have given a different rendering of <a href="/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a>. Many of them render the first clause according to the Peshito and Vulgate, "God chose something new," taking Elohim as the subject, and chadashim (new) as the object. But to this it has very properly been objected, that, according to the terms of the song, it was not Elohim but Jehovah who effected the deliverance of Israel, and that the Hebrew for new things is not &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, but &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-6.htm">Isaiah 48:6</a>), or &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (<a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a>). On these grounds Ewald and Bertheau render Elohim "judges" (they chose new judges), and appeal to <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7-8</a>, where the authorities who administered justice in the name of God are called Elohim. But these passages are not sufficient by themselves to establish the meaning "judges," and still less to establish the rendering "new judges" for Elohim chadashim. Moreover, according to both these explanations, the next clause must be understood as relating to the specially courageous conflict which the Israelites in their enthusiasm carried on with Sisera; whereas the further statement, that among 40,000 warriors who offered themselves willingly for battle there was not a shield or a lance to be seen, is irreconcilably at variance with this. For the explanation suggested, namely, that these warriors did not possess the ordinary weapons for a well-conducted engagement, but had nothing but bows and swords, or instead of weapons of any kind had only the staffs and tools of shepherds and husbandmen, is proved to be untenable by the simple fact that there is nothing at all to indicate any contrast between ordinary and extraordinary weapons, and that such a contrast is altogether foreign to the context. Moreover, the fact appealed to, that &#1488;&#1494; points to a victorious conflict in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-13.htm">Judges 5:13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22</a>, as well as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>, is not strong enough to support the view in question, as &#1488;&#1494; is employed in <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> in connection with the battle of the kings of Canaan, which was not a successful one, but terminated in a defeat.<p>The singer now turns from the contemplation of the deep degradation of Israel to the glorious change which took place as soon as she appeared: -  </body></html>
