He that will set the hearts of other men on fire with the love of Christ, must himself burn with love. Praising God is a work we should awake to, and awake ourselves unto. She notices who fought against Israel, who fought for them, and who kept away. Who fought against them. They were obstinate enemies to God's people, therefore the more dangerous. Who fought for them. The several tribes that helped are here spoken of with honour; for though God is above all to be glorified, those who are employed must have their due praise, to encourage others. But the whole creation is at war with those to whom God is an enemy. The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. At most times it was shallow, yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swelled, and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass, were drowned. Deborah's own soul fought against them. When the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of them, through the grace of God, the strength of our spiritual enemies will be trodden down, and will fall before us. She observes who kept away, and did not side with Israel, as might have been expected. Thus many are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of ease, and undue affection to their worldly business and advantage. Narrow, selfish spirits care not what becomes of God's church, so that they can but get, keep, and save money. All seek their own, Php 2:21. A little will serve those for a pretence to stay at home, who have no mind to engage in needful services, because there is difficulty and danger in them. But we cannot keep away from the contest between the Lord and his enemies; and if we do not actively endeavour to promote his cause in this wicked world, we shall fall under the curse against the workers of iniquity. Though He needs no human help, yet he is pleased to accept the services of those who improve their talents to advance his cause. He requires every man to do so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Probably an allusion to the frantic efforts of the chariot-horses to disengage themselves from the morass (<a href="/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a> note).<p>Mighty ones - Applied to bulls <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a> and horses <a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a>; elsewhere, as probably here, to men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

The reading &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; (stat. constr.), adopted by the old versions, must be taken as the correct one, and the introduction of the preposition &#1489;&#1468; does not preclude this (compare &#1489;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;,   <a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-21.htm">2 Samuel 1:21</a>, and Ewald, 289, b.). &#1506;&#1501;, which is used to denote an outward equality, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>, and is substantially the same as the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; which follows ("just as"), is construed without &#1499;&#1468; in the first clause, as in <a href="/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;: into the valley of Jezreel, the plain of Kishon. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8</a>, to be sent off, i.e., incessantly impelled, through his feet; here it is applied to an irresistible force of enthusiasm for the battle. The nominative to &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; is Issachar and Barak.<p>15b At the brooks of Reuben were great resolutions of heart.<p>16  Why remainest thou between the hurdles, <p>To hear the piping of the flocks?<p>At the brooks of Reuben were great projects of heart.<p>17  Gilead rests on the other side of the Jordan;<p>And Dan ... why tarries he by ships? <p>Asher sits on the shore of the sea, <p>And by his bays he reposes.<p>18  Zebulun, a people that despises its soul even to death, <p>And Naphtali upon the heights of the field.<p>In this strophe Deborah first of all mentions the tribes which took no part in the conflict (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15-17</a>), and then returns in <a href="/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a> to the Zebulunites, who staked their life along with Naphtali for the deliverance of Israel from the yoke of the enemy. The enumeration of the tribes who remained at a distance from the conflict commences with Reuben (<a href="/judges/5-15.htm">Judges 5:15</a> and <a href="/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a>). In this tribe there did arise a lively sympathy with the national elevation. They held meetings, passed great resolutions, but it led to no practical result; and at length they preferred to remain quietly at home in their own comfortable pastoral life. The meaning brooks for &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is well established by <a href="//biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm">Job 20:17</a>, and there is no reason whatever for explaining the word as equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, divisions (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-5.htm">2 Chronicles 35:5</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/35-12.htm">2 Chronicles 35:12</a>; <a href="/ezra/6-18.htm">Ezra 6:18</a>). The territory of Reuben, which was celebrated for its splendid pastures, must have abounded in brooks. The question, Why satest thou, or remainedst thou sitting between the hurdles? i.e., in the comfortable repose of a shepherd's life, is an utterance of amazement; and the irony is very apparent in the next clause, to hear the bleating of the flocks, i.e., the piping of the shepherds, instead of the blast of the war-trumpets. </body></html>
