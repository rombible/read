For it is expressly said, (<a href="/judges/4-21.htm" title="Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.">Jdg 4:21</a>,) that Jael smote the nail quite through his temples, so as to fasten him to the ground; from whence there is great reason to conclude that the blow was instantaneously fatal, and that he never struggled nor stirred. This verse is thus translated by Dr. Kennicott:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">At her feet he bowed, he fell! At her feet he bowed, he fell!</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Where he bowed, there he fell dead.</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And he supposes, naturally enough, the first line to be sung by Deborah, the second by Barak, and that they both joined in singing the third. The whole verse is greatly expressive of the joy of Deborah on this occasion, and shows, in a strong light, her love for her country and people. She dwells on every circumstance with seeming pleasure; she repeats them, as it were, to enjoy the idea and contemplation of them the longer. And one would think all the enemies of Israel had perished in this one man.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:24-31 Jael had a special blessing. Those whose lot is cast in the tent, in a low and narrow sphere, if they serve God according to the powers he has given them, shall not lose their reward. The mother of Sisera looked for his return, not in the least fearing his success. Let us take heed of indulging eager desires towards any temporal good, particularly toward that which cherishes vain-glory, for that was what she here doted on. What a picture does she present of an ungodly and sensual heart! How shameful and childish these wishes of an aged mother and her attendants for her son! And thus does God often bring ruin on his enemies when they are most puffed up. Deborah concludes with a prayer to God for the destruction of all his foes, and for the comfort of all his friends. Such shall be the honour, and joy of all who love God in sincerity, they shall shine for ever as the sun in the firmament.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather "she smote his head, and she struck and pierced through his temple." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/judges/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. butter&#8212;curdled milk; a favorite beverage in the East.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/judges/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here is a lively representation of the thing done.

This action is not otherwise to be justified, but by its being done through an impulse of the Spirit of God upon her, to take away the life of an implacable enemy of God's people; otherwise it might seem to be a breach of hospitality towards her guest she had invited in, and of the peace which subsisted between this general's prince and her husband; and therefore is not to be drawn into an example where there is no appearance of a divine warrant. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>.

They were smitten; the brook Kishon washed them (i.e., their corpses) away. The meaning "to wash away" is well established by the dialects and the context, though the verb itself only occurs here. As the battle was fought between Taanach and Megiddo, i.e., to the south of the brook Kishon, and the smitten foe fled towards the north, many of them met with their death in the waves of the brook, which was flowing over its banks at the time. The brook is called &#1511;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, i.e., the brook of the old world or the olden time (according to the lxx Cod. Vat. &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;), as the stream that had been flowing from time immemorial, and not, as the Chaldee interprets it, the stream that had been celebrated from olden time on account of the mighty acts that had been performed there. The meaning suggested by Ewald and others, "brook of attacks, or slaughters," is not well sustained, although &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; is sometimes used to denote a hostile encounter. The last clause interrupts the description of the slaughter and the victory. Borne away by the might of the acts to be commemorated, Deborah stimulates her soul, i.e., herself, to a vigorous continuation of her song. &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; is jussive, and &#1506;&#1494; an accusative governed by the verb, in strength, vigorously; for she had still to celebrate the glorious results of the victory. This is done in the third part of the song (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22-31</a>), the first strophe of which (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22-24</a>) describes in brief drastic traits the flight of the foe, and the treatment of the fugitives by the people of the land. </body></html>
