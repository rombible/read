The injuries done to Israel by any of their enemies, and particularly what wrongs had been done them by Jabin, king of Canaan, for twenty years past; though some understand it of the vengeance God took on Israel for their sins; and though praise is not given directly for that, yet inasmuch as, when that was the case, there were some whose spirits were stirred up to engage voluntarily in the deliverance of them from the oppression of their enemies, it was matter of praise: <p>when the people willingly offered themselves: to go and fight for Israel against their enemies, particularly those of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, <a href="/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>; though not excluding others that joined, who could not have been forced to it, had they not freely offered themselves; and which was owing to the secret influence of divine Providence on their hearts, moving and drawing them to this service; and therefore praise was due to the Lord on this account, who works in the hearts of men both to will and to do, as in things spiritual and religious, so in things natural and civil. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> people willingly offered themselves.</span><p>(a) That is, the two tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. The translation, after the LXX. cod.

Bless you the LORD.">Jdg 5:9</a></span>), but it rests on slender support. The noun rendered <span class="ital">leaders</span> has this meaning among others (such as <span class="ital">abundant hair</span>, in Arabic), but in Hebrew the verb ‘took the lead’ properly means to <span class="ital">loosen</span> <a href="/exodus/5-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you to your burdens.">Exodus 5:4</a>, especially <span class="ital">to let the hair go loose</span> <a href="/leviticus/10-6.htm" title="And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest wrath come on all the people: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, mourn the burning which the LORD has kindled.">Leviticus 10:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm" title="And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.">Leviticus 13:45</a>, and the noun is used of the long <span class="ital">locks</span> of the Nazirites <a href="/numbers/6-5.htm" title="All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come on his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separates himself to the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.">Numbers 6:5</a>. Wearing the hair long was the mark of a vow not to do certain things until a specified object had been attained; the practice was observed not only by the Nazirites but by warriors bent upon vengeance; for an illustration from Arabic see Wellhausen, <span class="ital">Reste Arab. Heidenthums</span>2, p. 123 <span class="ital">n.</span>, and cf. <a href="/psalms/68-21.htm" title="But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goes on still in his trespasses.">Psalm 68:21</a>. Hence we may transl. <span class="bld">when the locks grew long in Israel</span> i.e. when the warriors took the vow of vengeance: this may be the meaning of the same word in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-42.htm" title="I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy.">Deuteronomy 32:42</a> ‘from the long-haired heads of the foe.’ <span class="ital">Offered themselves willingly</span>, of volunteering for battle, only again in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-16.htm" title="And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.">2 Chronicles 17:16</a>, cf. <a href="/psalms/110-3.htm" title="Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: you have the dew of your youth.">Psalm 110:3</a>; usually of offerings to the Temple in Chr., Ezr., Neh.

The anomaly apparent in the use of the gender may be accounted for on the ground that the masculine was the more general form, and might therefore be used for the more definite feminine. There are not sufficient grounds for altering it into &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1491;, the inf. abs. Whether Jael complied with this wish is not stated; but in the place of anything further, the chief fact alone is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/4-21.htm">Judges 4:21</a>, namely, that Jael took a tent-plug, and went with a hammer in her hand to Sisera, who had fallen through exhaustion into a deep sleep, and drove the plug into his temples, so that it penetrated into the earth, or the floor. The words &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;&#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; are introduced as explanatory of the course of the events: "but he was fallen into a deep sleep, and exhausted," i.e., had fallen fast asleep through exhaustion. "And so he died." &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; is attached as a consequence to &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1504;&#1495; ... &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1511;&#1506;, whereas &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; belongs to the parenthetical clause &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;. This is the explanation adopted by Rosenmller, and also in the remark of Kimchi: "the words &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; &#1504;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; indicate the reason why Sisera neither heard Jael approach him, nor was conscious of the blow inflicted upon him." For the combination of &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1507; with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, "then he became exhausted and died," which Stud. and Bertheau support, does not give any intelligible thought at all. A man who has a tent-peg driven with a hammer into his temples, so that the peg passes through his head into the ground, does not become exhausted before he dies, but dies instantaneously.
