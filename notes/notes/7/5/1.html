As the English version requires some correction, I have appended a translation at the end of the chapter, which must be regarded as a kind of running commentary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/5-1.htm" title="Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,">Jdg 5:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then sang Deborah — </span>The composer of this song, one of whose special gifts, as a prophetess, it was to sing God’s praises, <a href="/context/1_chronicles/25-1.htm" title="Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:...">1 Chronicles 25:1-3</a>. <span class="ital">And Barak — </span>Who was now probably become a judge, in consequence of this great deliverance which God had wrought by him. <span class="ital">On that day — </span>In which they had completed their victory, by the destruction of Jabin’s kingdom. Whether they two only sang this song, or the elders of the people, called together into one assembly, sang it with them, is not certain. The text, however, only speaks of its being sung by them two; and Dr. Kennicott has expressed his opinion strongly, that they sang it in alternate verses, answering each other, and that the not observing this has rendered many parts of it obscure, and of difficult interpretation, and destroyed the force and beauty of the whole. “It is certain,” says he, “though very little attended to, that it is said to have been sung <span class="ital">by Deborah and by Barak. </span>It is also certain, there are in it parts which Deborah could not sing; as well as parts which Barak could not sing. And therefore it seems necessary, in order to form a better judgment of this song, that some probable distribution should be made of it; while those words which seem most likely to have been sung by either party, should be assigned to their proper name; either to that of Deborah the prophetess, or that of Barak the captain-general. For example: Deborah could not call upon Deborah, exhorting <span class="ital">herself to awake, </span>&c., as in <a href="/judges/5-12.htm" title="Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.">Jdg 5:12</a>. Neither could Barak exhort himself to <span class="ital">arise, </span>&c., in the same verse. Again: Barak could not sing, <span class="ital">Till I Deborah arose, a mother in Israel, </span>in <a href="/judges/5-7.htm" title="The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.">Jdg 5:7</a>. Nor could Deborah sing about <span class="ital">a damsel or two </span>for every soldier, in <a href="/judges/5-30.htm" title="Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needlework, of divers colors of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?">Jdg 5:30</a> : though indeed, as to this last article, the words are probably misunderstood.” The doctor, therefore, to do more justice, as he judges, to “this celebrated song,” which, he says, is deservedly admired, furnishes us with a new translation of it, assigning therein to Deborah and Barak the parts which he supposes each to have sung, and representing them, through the whole, as answering each other. See <span class="ital">Kennicott’s Remarks on Select Passages of the Old Testament, </span>p. 94. We must leave the reader to judge for himself what weight there is in what the doctor advances, and shall only observe as to this hymn in general, that, like the songs of Moses, (Exodus 15.; and Deuteronomy 32,) it is distinguished in the Hebrew, as being poetry, and in our present translation would appear to more advantage if printed in hemistics. See on <a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>. It must be evident to every reader, that it is expressed in another kind of style than that of the historical part of this book; and in language so majestic, in such a variety of elegant figures, and such natural expressions of those affections which the occasion requires, that none of the ancient Greek or Latin poets have equalled the noble flow of these divine strains.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5. No time should be lost in returning thanks to the Lord for his mercies; for our praises are most acceptable, pleasant, and profitable, when they flow from a full heart. By this, love and gratitude would be more excited and more deeply fixed in the hearts of believers; the events would be more known and longer remembered. Whatever Deborah, Barak, or the army had done, the Lord must have all the praise. The will, the power, and the success were all from Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deborah, as "a prophetess," both composed and sang this noble ode, which, for poetic spirit and lyric fire, is not surpassed by any of the sacred songs in the Bible. And, as Miriam took up the first verse of the song of Moses <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>, and sang it as an antiphony, so Barak, with the chorus of men, answered the song of Deborah by singing <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2</a>, which is also exactly suited for an antiphon, summing up as it does the subject matter of the whole ode.
