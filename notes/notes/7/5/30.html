Commentators quote a remarkable parallel from Gibbon (2, ch. 11), where he says that two or three Gothic female captives fell to the share of each of the soldiers of Claudius II. (“Tantum mulierum cepimus,ut <span class= "ital">binas et ternasmulieres </span>victor sibi miles possit adjungere.”—Trebellius Pollio, 8) The reading of the Peshito is, “a heap, two heaps,” as in <a href="/judges/15-16.htm" title="And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps on heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.">Judges 15:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Of divers colours.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">of dyed robes.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of divers colours of needlework.</span>—<span class= "ital">Of dyed robes of embroidered webs.</span><p><span class= "bld">Of divers colours of needlework on both sides.</span>—<span class= "ital">A dyed robe, two embroidered webs.</span><p><span class= "bld">Meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?</span>—Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">for the necks of the spoil. </span>As this gives no good sense, our version follows those which here understand “spoil” as equivalent to “spoiler.” The old versions take “spoil” in apposition to the rest of the sentence: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>the LXX. have, “dyed robes of embroidered webs for his neck, as spoils,” and a similar meaning is involved in the loose paraphrase of the Vulgate. Others explain it to mean that the dyed robes are to be carried on the necks of the female slaves and the captive cattle. Ewald reads <span class= "ital">shegal </span>(“queen “) for <span class= "ital">shellal </span>(<span class= "ital">“</span>prey “)—a brilliant and probable conjecture; for if the booty of the soldiers and the general is mentioned, the royal ladies would be hardly likely to forget themselves. In any case, the mother of Sisera is characteristically described (as Bishop Lowth has pointed out) as talking neither of the slaughter of the enemy nor the prowess of the warriors, but only of the gay and feminine booty. (Comp. “Faemineo praedae et spoliorum arderet amore,” <span class= "ital">Æn. </span>xi. 728.) Nothing can exceed the power and skill with which in a few words the vanity, levity, and arrogance of these “wise princesses” are described, as they idly talk of colours and embroidery, and, as it were, gloat over the description; while, at the same time, an unwomanly coarseness (<span class= "ital">racham, </span>for “maiden”) mingles with their womanly frivolity. Only we must bear in mind that they too, like Deborah and Jael, though in an ignobler way, are the creatures of their age and circumstances.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:24-31 Jael had a special blessing. Those whose lot is cast in the tent, in a low and narrow sphere, if they serve God according to the powers he has given them, shall not lose their reward. The mother of Sisera looked for his return, not in the least fearing his success. Let us take heed of indulging eager desires towards any temporal good, particularly toward that which cherishes vain-glory, for that was what she here doted on. What a picture does she present of an ungodly and sensual heart! How shameful and childish these wishes of an aged mother and her attendants for her son! And thus does God often bring ruin on his enemies when they are most puffed up. Deborah concludes with a prayer to God for the destruction of all his foes, and for the comfort of all his friends. Such shall be the honour, and joy of all who love God in sincerity, they shall shine for ever as the sun in the firmament.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render the latter part of the verse "a booty of dyed garments for Sisera, a booty of dyed garments and of party-colored cloth, a dyed garment and two party-colored clothes for the necks of the booty," the spoil or booty being either captive damsels, or captive cattle on whose necks these clothes are to be placed (either as ornament or as a burden; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/8-21.htm">Judges 8:21</a>, <a href="/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>).

But Sisera's mother wished other booty for him; namely, the gold-threaded, richly embroidered, and scarlet-colored cloaks which were held in such high esteem.
