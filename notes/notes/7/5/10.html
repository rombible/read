The word can hardly mean “white,” because there are no such things as white asses. It means rather “bright-coloured” (<a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), “glossy-skinned,” or “dappled” (<span class= "ital">super nitentes asinos, </span>Vulg.). These were the more valuable sort of asses, and were used by the rich and great. It is only because this was not understood among the Greeks and Romans, who despised the ass, that the LXX. and Josephus so often disguise the word in writing for Gentiles, using <span class= "ital">pōlon, “</span>steed,” or the general word <span class= "ital">hupozugion, </span>“beast of burden,” instead. No incident was more derided among the Gentiles than the riding to Zion of her king, “meek and sitting upon an ass” (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>), (see the <span class= "ital">Life of Christ, </span>2:197).

On the phrases “sitting at home and “walking on the roads” to describe the ordinary avocations of life, see <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm" title="And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> : “When thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/5-10.htm" title="Speak, you that ride on white asses, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.">Jdg 5:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Speak ye </span>— Celebrate the praise of our mighty God, and give him thanks.

These could not appear in any splendour during the servitude and oppression under Jabin, but now were restored to their dignity, which she calls upon them to consider, and for which to praise the Lord. There were few horses in Judea but what were brought out of other countries, so that the greatest persons rode on asses, as appears by the sacred history; but in this country they were commonly of a red colour, (whence, as Bochart observes, an ass hath the name of <span class="greekheb">כמור</span>, <span class="ital">chamor,</span>) and therefore <span class="ital">white, </span>or, as he translates the word, <span class="ital">whitish asses, </span>or those streaked with white, were highly esteemed for their rarity. <span class="ital">Ye that sit in judgment — </span>Those that sat as judges in the gates, which were no longer possessed by the enemies, she here exhorts to join with the nobles before mentioned. <span class="ital">And walk by the way — </span>The merchants, traffickers, and others, who could now travel safely about their business, which they durst not do before this deliverance, <a href="/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Jdg 5:6</a>; for which, therefore, they were bound to praise God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-11. Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny of Jabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows what brought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose new gods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped. Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvation of their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of this great salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as are restored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to their rank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts of his, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution, God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life are drawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attend them. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer from drawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to his trembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are most exposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we have from the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and give God the praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye that ride on white donkeys ... - i. e. nobles or magistrates.

Though in some countries, as in ours, it is reckoned disgraceful to ride on asses; so Leo Africanus (b) makes mention of a preacher in Africa, who was called the ass rider; because he was continually, sitting on an ass; yet in Judea, where there were no horses, or very few, it was accounted honourable; so it was in the time of our Lord; for his riding on an ass to Jerusalem was not mean and disgraceful, but honourable and glorious: and so it certainly was in those early times of the judges; for we read of the sons of two of them, which were very numerous, that rode on asses' colts, <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>, and it seems that white asses were the most valuable, and chiefly used by great personages. The ass in the Hebrew language has its name from redness, that being the usual colour of them in those parts; and hence they were hateful to the Egyptians, because that their Typhon was of that colour (c); but there were some that were white, as there are wild ones now of that colour. A traveller (d) in those parts in the beginning of the last century tells us, that on the banks of the Euphrates they beheld every day great droves of wild beasts, as wild asses "all white", &amp;c. The word we translate "white" is "zechorot", and perhaps may describe the same animal the Ethiopians call "zecora", and some "zebra"; said to excel in beauty all four footed creatures in the whole world. It is an animal of the size of a mule, found in the woods beyond Abyssinia, is easily tamed, and is the frequent and chief present of the kings of that country; about its loins is a circle of a black colour, in the form of a girdle, which is followed with more on each side, according to the part of the body, some broader, others narrower, both black and white, or of an ash colour, so neat that they seem to exceed the art of the most eminent painter; its only deformity are its ears, which are long; hence it is called by the Portuguese the wild ass, though wrongly; of what value and esteem it was appears from the large price it has been sold for; one, that was the gift of a king to a Turkish governor, was sold to an Indian for 2,000 pieces of Venetian money, to make a present of to the great Mogor, king of the Indians (e), which was the value of nine hundred pounds. Those that rode on these creatures were the princes and nobles of Israel; though they are generally interpreted by the Jewish commentators of merchants that rode from place to place about business; and these are called upon to speak of the wonderful things God had done for Israel, in freeing them from the bondage of the Canaanites, so that these nobles or merchants might ride about the country without any fear; and to discourse of them to others, and in their meditations give praise to God on account of them: <p>ye that sit in judgment; which seems to describe judges upon the bench, sitting to hear and try causes, and pass righteous judgment; these are also exhorted to give thanks to the Lord, that they were now restored to their seats of judgment, from which they were driven; or where they could not peaceably exercise their office, which they now might and did: Cocceius renders the word "on measures", as if these were persons that presided over measures, and took care that they were just and right. Though Kimchi and Ben Melech say, that Middin, which we render "in judgment", is either the name of a city in the book of Joshua; see Gill on <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm">Joshua 15:61</a>, or the name of a way (f) well known, in which they were afraid to go because of the enemy, but now went in it with safety, and therefore had reason to speak well of God, and praise his name; but this is rather intended in the next clause: <p>and walk by the way; the common people that travelled from place to place on business, who before were obliged to leave the public roads, and go in byways, <a href="/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a> but now could travel in the common road without fear, and therefore ought to be thankful. <p>(b) Descriptio Africae, l. 5. p. 574.

Cf. <a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Jdg 10:4</a>, <a href="/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Jdg 12:14</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/17-23.htm" title="And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.">2 Samuel 17:23</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-26.htm" title="And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because your servant is lame.">2 Samuel 19:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">rich carpets</span>] from a word which means <span class="ital">garment, raiment</span> (e.g. <a href="/judges/3-16.htm" title="But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment on his right thigh.">Jdg 3:16</a>), here supposed to refer to the <span class="ital">raiment</span>, i.e. saddle-cloths, of the asses.

Just as Moses in his blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>) referred the tribes of Israel to this mighty act, as the source of all salvation and blessing for Israel, so the prophetess Deborah makes the praise of this glorious manifestation of God the starting-point of her praise of the great grace, which Jehovah as the faithful covenant God had displayed to His people in her own days. The tacit allusion to Moses' blessing is very unmistakeable. But whereas Moses describes the descent of the Lord upon Sinai (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>), according to its gracious significance in relation to the tribes of Israel, as an objective fact (Jehovah came from Sinai, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), Deborah clothes the remembrance of it in the form of an address to God, to bring out the thought that the help which Israel had just experienced was a renewal of the coming of the Lord to His people. Jehovah's going out of Seir, and marching out of the fields of Edom, is to be interpreted in the same sense as His rising up from Seir (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>). As the descent of the Lord upon Sinai is depicted there as a rising of the sun from the east, so the same descent in a black cloud amidst thunder, lightning, fire, and vapour of smoke (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), is represented here with direct allusion to these phenomena as a storm rising up from Seir in the east, in which the Lord advanced to meet His people as they came from the west to Sinai. Before the Lord, who came down upon Sinai in the storm and darkness of the cloud, the earth shook and the heaven dropped, or, as it is afterwards more definitely explained, the clouds dropped with water, emptied themselves of their abundance of water as they do in the case of a storm. The mountains shook (&#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, Niphal of &#1494;&#1500;&#1500;, dropping the reduplication of the &#1500;  equals  &#1504;&#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/64-2.htm">Isaiah 64:2</a>), even the strong rocky mountain of Sinai, which stood out so distinctly before the eyes of the singer, that she speaks of it as "this Sinai," pointing to it as though it were locally near. David's description of the miraculous guidance of Israel through the desert in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8-9</a>, is evidently founded upon this passage, though it by no means follows from this that the passage before us also treats of the journey through the desert, as Clericus supposes, or even of the presence of the Lord in the battle with Sisera, and the victory which it secured. But greatly as Israel had been exalted at Sinai by the Lord its God, it had fallen just as deeply into bondage to its oppressors through its own sins, until Deborah arose to help it (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6-8</a>). </body></html>
