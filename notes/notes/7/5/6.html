That Shamgar is thus (apparently) alluded to as a contemporary of Jael has an important bearing on the chronology; for it at least shows that simultaneous struggles may have been going on against the Philistines in the south and the Canaanites in the north.<p><span class= "bld">In the days of Jael.</span>—It has been thought so strange that Deborah should mention the name of the Bedouin chieftainess as marking the epoch, that some have supposed “Jael” to be the name of some unknown judge; and some have even proposed to read Jair. Others render it “the helper,” and suppose that Ehud, or Shamgar, is referred to. But (1) Jael is essentially a woman’s name (see <a href="/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Judges 4:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-19.htm" title="Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.">Proverbs 5:19</a>); (2) she is mentioned prominently in this very song as having put the finishing stroke to the victory of Israel; and (3) she may have been—and various incidents in the history lead us to suppose that she was—a woman of great importance and influence, even independently of her murder of Sisera.<p><span class= "bld">The highways were unoccupied.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">kept holiday. </span>This had been foretold in <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm" title="I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.">Leviticus 26:22</a>. The grass grew on them; there was no one to occupy them. “The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth” (<a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm" title="The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: he has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he regards no man.">Isaiah 33:8</a>). “The land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned” (<a href="/zechariah/7-14.htm" title="But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.">Zechariah 7:14</a>). (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/15-5.htm" title="And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were on all the inhabitants of the countries.">2Chronicles 15:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm" title="The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.">Lamentations 1:4</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-18.htm" title="They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.">Lamentations 4:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Travellers.</span>—Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">walkers of paths. </span>Those of the unhappy conquered race whose necessities obliged them to journey from one place to another could only slink along, unobserved, by twisted—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>tortuous, devious—bye-lanes. A traveller in America was reminded of this verse when he saw the neutral ground in 1780, with “houses plundered and dismantled, enclosures broken down, cattle carried away, fields lying waste, the roads grass-grown, the country mournful, solitary, silent.”—(Washington Irving’s “Life of Washington,” ch. 137)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/judges/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/judges/5-6.htm" title="In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.">Jdg 5:6</a>. </span><span class="ital">In the days of Shamgar, </span>&c. — In this and the two following verses Deborah, to give the Israelites a just sense of their deliverance, and excite them to greater thankfulness, represents the miseries to which the Canaanites had reduced them by twenty years’ oppression; their public roads or high-ways were deserted for fear of robbers or violence; their villages depopulated; their cities blocked up, and their country overrun with the enemy’s soldiers; while themselves were disarmed, dispirited, and helpless; till it pleased God to look down upon them with compassion, and raise up deliverance for them. <span class="ital">In the days of Jael, </span>&c. — Jael, though an illustrious woman, effected nothing for the deliverance of God’s people. <span class="ital">The travellers walked through by-ways — </span>Because of the Philistines and Canaanites, who, besides the public burdens which they laid upon the Israelites, waited for all opportunities to do them mischief secretly; watching for travellers in common roads, as is usual with enemies in times of war; and because of the wicked even of their own people, who, having cast off the fear of God, and there being no king in Israel to punish them, broke forth into acts of injustice and violence, even against their own brethren. The Jael mentioned in this verse is generally taken to be the wife of Heber, who slew Sisera. But “the phrase, <span class="ital">in the days of Jael, </span>implies times past, and supposes that Jael was dead as well as Shamgar. Besides, what honour could redound to the prophetess from such a comparison? Is it worthy of a boast, that she, who was judge in Israel, had done more in delivering them from the enemy than Heber’s wife, who was only a sojourner in Israel, and whose husband was at peace with the enemy? The Jael, therefore, here mentioned, seems to have been a prophetess raised up before Deborah to judge Israel, but who died without delivering them. It is true indeed the name of this prophetess is not mentioned before; but neither are any of the transactions of the time in which she is supposed to have lived recorded; nor is Shamgar’s name mentioned more than once, <a href="/judges/3-31.htm" title="And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.">Jdg 3:31</a>, and then principally on account of that single exploit, of slaying six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad.” — Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-11. Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny of Jabin, that their salvation might appear more gracious. She shows what brought this misery upon them. It was their idolatry. They chose new gods, with new names. But under all these images, Satan was worshipped. Deborah was a mother to Israel, by diligently promoting the salvation of their souls. She calls on those who shared the advantages of this great salvation, to offer up thanks to God for it. Let such as are restored, not only to their liberty as other Israelites, but to their rank, speak God's praises. This is the Lord's doing. In these acts of his, justice was executed on his enemies. In times of persecution, God's ordinances, the walls of salvation, whence the waters of life are drawn, are resorted to at the hazard of the lives of those who attend them. At all times Satan will endeavour to hinder the believer from drawing near to the throne of grace. Notice God's kindness to his trembling people. It is the glory of God to protect those who are most exposed, and to help the weakest. Let us notice the benefit we have from the public peace, the inhabitants of villages especially, and give God the praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/judges/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Words dcscriptive of a state of weakness and fear, so that Israel could not frequent the highways.
