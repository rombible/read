Those whose lot is cast in the tent, in a low and narrow sphere, if they serve God according to the powers he has given them, shall not lose their reward. The mother of Sisera looked for his return, not in the least fearing his success. Let us take heed of indulging eager desires towards any temporal good, particularly toward that which cherishes vain-glory, for that was what she here doted on. What a picture does she present of an ungodly and sensual heart! How shameful and childish these wishes of an aged mother and her attendants for her son! And thus does God often bring ruin on his enemies when they are most puffed up. Deborah concludes with a prayer to God for the destruction of all his foes, and for the comfort of all his friends.

That is, Sisera asked it of her, as the Targum expresses it, when he turned into her tent: <p>she brought him fresh butter in a lordly dish; which signifies either the same, the milk with cream on it, for that is meant by butter; or having first taken off the cream, she gave him milk to drink, and then brought the cream in a dish for him to eat, and thereby the more incline him to sleep; and this she brought in a dish fit for any lord or nobleman to eat out of; in such a polite and courteous manner did she use him, so that he could have no suspicion of her having any ill design against him. R. Jonah, as Kimchi notes, interprets this of a dish of the mighty or lordly ones, of the shepherds, the principal of the flock, as they are called in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>, out of which they had used to drink their milk, or eat their cream, and such an one was likely enough to be Jael's tent; from this Hebrew word "sepel", here used, seems to come the Latin word "simpucium" or "simpulum", used in things sacred, and which, according to Pliny (t), was an earthen vessel; and so some of the Rabbins, as Kimchi observes, say, this was a new earthen vial; it is very probable it was a broad platter or dish fit for such an use. <p>(t) Nat.

Kings came on and fought. They were the kings of Canaan, since Jabin, like his ancestor (<a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>.), had formed an alliance with other kings of northern Canaan, who went to the battle under the command of Sisera. The battle took place at Taanach (see at <a href="/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>), by the water of Megiddo, the present Lejun (see at <a href="/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>), i.e., by the brook Kishon (cf. <a href="/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7</a>). Taanach and Megiddo were not quite five miles apart, and beside and between them there were several brooks which ran into the southern arm of the Kishon, that flowed through the plain to the north of both these towns. The hostile kings went into the battle with the hope of slaying the Israelites and making a rich capture of booty. But their hopes were disappointed. They could not take with them a piece of silver as booty. &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, which generally signifies booty or gain, is probably to be taken here in its primary sense of frustum, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, to cut off or cut in pieces, a "piece of silver," equivalent to a single piece of valuable booty. </body></html>
