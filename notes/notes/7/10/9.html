Not content with the oppression of the tribes on the other side Jordan, which had continued eighteen years, they came over Jordan into the land of Canaan to ravage that, and bring other of the tribes into subjection to them, particularly the three next mentioned, which lay readiest for them, when they were come over Jordan: <p>to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim who lay to the south and the southeast of the land of Canaan, and were the first the Ammonites had to fight with and subdue, when they had crossed Jordan to the east of it: <p>so that Israel was sore distressed; by the Ammonites in the east, threatening those three tribes, mentioned, and the Philistines on the west, who gave disturbance to the tribes that lay nearest them, as Asher, Zebulun, Naphtali, Issachar, and Dan; and this distress was begun the same year in different parts, by different enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/judges/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/judges/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">was sore distressed</span>] Cf. <a href="/judges/2-15.htm" title="Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.">Jdg 2:15</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Ammon</span>, etc. It would seem that at this time the king of the children of Ammon was also king of the Moabites, since he laid claim (<a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13, 24</a>) to the land which had once belonged to Moab. If we may trust the king of the Ammonites' statement, the object of the war was to recover that land, and he carried the war across the Jordan into the territory of Judah and Ephraim in order to compel the Israelites to give it up. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After him Jair the Gileadite (born in Gilead) judged Israel for twenty-two years. Nothing further is related of him than that he had thirty sons who rode upon thirty asses, which was a sign of distinguished rank in those times when the Israelites had no horses. They had thirty cities (the second &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a> is another form for &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, from a singular &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;  equals  &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, a city, and is chosen because of its similarity in sound to &#1506;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, asses). These cities they were accustomed to call Havvoth-jair unto this day (the time when our book was written), in the land of Gilead. The &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; before &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is placed first for the sake of emphasis, "even these they call," etc. This statement is not at variance with the fact, that in the time of Moses the Manassite Jair gave the name of Havvoth-jair to the towns of Bashan which had been conquered by him (<a href="/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>); for it is not affirmed here, that the thirty cities which belonged to the sons of Jair received this name for the first time from the judge Jair, but simply that this name was brought into use again by the sons of Jair, and was applied to these cities in a peculiar sense. (For further remarks on the Havvoth-jair, see at <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>.) The situation of Camon, where Jair was buried, is altogether uncertain. Josephus (Ant. v. 6, 6) calls it a city of Gilead, though probably only on account of the assumption, that it would not be likely that Jair the Gileadite, who possessed so many cities in Gilead, should be buried outside Gilead. But this assumption is a very questionable one. As Jair judged Israel after Tola the Issacharite, the assumption is a more natural one, that he lived in Canaan proper. Yet Reland (Pal. ill. p. 679) supports the opinion that it was in Gilead, and adduces the fact that Polybius (Hist. v. 70, 12) mentions a town called &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, by the side of Pella and Gefrun, as having been taken by Antiochus. On the other hand, Eusebius and Jerome (in the Onom.) regard our Camon as being the same as the &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7; &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x39b;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;, six Roman miles to the north of Legio (Lejun), on the way to Ptolemais, which would be in the plain of Jezreel or Esdraelon. This is no doubt applicable to the &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; of Judith 7:3; but whether it also applies to our Camon cannot be decided, as the town is not mentioned again. </body></html>
