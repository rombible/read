Or, <span class="ital">they vexed</span> them <span class="ital">in that year</span>, that was the eighteenth year, to wit, of that vexation. This was the eighteenth year from the beginning of that oppression. And these eighteen years are not to be reckoned from Jair’s death, because that would enlarge the time of the judges beyond the just bounds, as may appear from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.">1 Kings 6:1</a></span>; nor from Jephthah’s beginning to reign, because he reigned but six years, and in the beginning thereof put an end to this persecution; but from the fourth year of Jair’s reign; so that the greatest part of Jair’s reign was contemporary with this affliction. And although this oppression of the Ammonites and Philistines, and the cause of it, the idolatry of the Israelites, be not mentioned till after Jair’s death, because the sacred penman would deliver the whole history of this calamity entirely and together; yet they both happened before it; and Jair’s death is mentioned before that only by a <span class="ital">prolepsis</span> or anticipation than which nothing is more frequent in Scripture. The case of Jair and Samson seem to be much alike. For as it is said of Samson, that <span class="ital">he judged Israel in the days</span> of the tyranny <span class="ital">of the Philistines twenty years</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/15-20.htm" title="And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.">Judges 15:20</a></span>, by which it is evident that his judicature and their dominion were contemporary; the like is to be conceived of Jair, that he began to judge Israel, and endeavoured to reform religion and purge out all abuses; but being unable to effect this, through the backwardness and baseness of the people, God would not enable him to deliver the people, but gave them up to this sad oppression; so that Jair could only perform one half of his office, which was to determine differences amongst the Israelites, but could not deliver them from their enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/judges/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel,.... The Philistines on one side, and the children of Ammon on the other; meaning either that year in which Jair died, as Jarchi; or the first year they began to bring them into bondage, as R.

It does not appear clearly what particular year is meant. Jarchi explains it as the year in which air died.

But in its narrower and stricter sense Gilead was bounded on the north by Bashan proper, and on the south by the <span class="accented">Mishor</span>, or plain of Medeba, which lay between the valley of Heshbon and the river Arnon, thus excluding that part of the territory of Reuben from Gilead (see <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9-11</a>). Originally, as we learn from <a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13-22</a>, the territory bounded by the Arnon on the south, by the Jabbok on the north, by the wilderness on the east, and by the Jordan on the west, had belonged to Moab, but the Amorites had taken it from them before the conquest of Sihon by the Israelites. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of these two judges no particular deeds are mentioned, no doubt because they performed none.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/judges/10-1.htm">Judges 10:1-2</a><p>Tola arose after Abimelech's death to deliver Israel, and judged Israel twenty-three years until his death, though certainly not all the Israelites of the twelve tribes, but only the northern and possibly also the eastern tribes, to the exclusion of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, as these southern tribes neither took part in Gideon's war of freedom nor stood under Abimelech's rule. To explain the clause "there arose to defend (or save) Israel," when nothing had been said about any fresh oppression on the part of the foe, we need not assume, as Rosenmller does, "that the Israelites had been constantly harassed by their neighbours, who continued to suppress the liberty of the Israelites, and from whose stratagems or power the Israelites were delivered by the acts of Tola;" but Tola rose up as the deliverer of Israel, even supposing that he simply regulated the affairs of the tribes who acknowledged him as their supreme judge, and succeeded by his efforts in preventing the nation from falling back into idolatry, and thus guarded Israel from any fresh oppression on the part of hostile nations. Tola was the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, of the tribe of Issachar. The names Tola and Puah are already met with among the descendants of Issachar, as founders of families of the tribes of Issachar (see <a href="/genesis/46-13.htm">Genesis 46:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23</a>, where the latter name is written &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;), and they were afterwards repeated in the different households of these families. Dodo is not an appellative, as the Sept. translators supposed (&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), but a proper name, as in <a href="/2_samuel/23-9.htm">2 Samuel 23:9</a> (Keri), 24, and <a href="/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a>. The town of Shamir, upon the mountains of Ephraim, where Tola judged Israel, and was afterwards buried, was a different place from the Shamir upon the mountains of Judah, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>, and its situation (probably in the territory of Issachar) is still unknown.</body></html>
