And these eighteen years are not to be reckoned from Jair’s death, because that would enlarge the time of the judges beyond the just bounds; but from the fourth year of Jair’s reign: so that the greatest part of Jair’s reign was cotemporary with this affliction. This case of Jair and that of Samson seem to be much alike. For as it is said of Samson, that <span class="ital">he judged Israel in the days </span>of the tyranny <span class="ital">of the Philistines, twenty years, </span><a href="/judges/15-20.htm" title="And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.">Jdg 15:20</a>; by which it is evident that his judicature and their dominion were cotemporary; the like is to be conceived of Jair, that he began to judge Israel, and endeavoured to reform religion, and purge out all abuses; but being unable to effect this, through the backwardness of the people, God would not enable him to deliver the people, but gave them up to this sad oppression; so that Jair could only determine differences among the Israelites, but could not deliver them from their enemies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/judges/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:6-9 Now the threatening was fulfilled, that the Israelites should have no power to stand before their enemies, Le 26:17,37.

Probably the same Philistine domination as is described more fully in the history of the judgeship of Samson (chs. 13-16.). But now the writer confines his attention first to the oppression of the Ammonites. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/judges/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of these two judges no particular deeds are mentioned, no doubt because they performed none.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/judges/10-1.htm">Judges 10:1-2</a><p>Tola arose after Abimelech's death to deliver Israel, and judged Israel twenty-three years until his death, though certainly not all the Israelites of the twelve tribes, but only the northern and possibly also the eastern tribes, to the exclusion of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, as these southern tribes neither took part in Gideon's war of freedom nor stood under Abimelech's rule. To explain the clause "there arose to defend (or save) Israel," when nothing had been said about any fresh oppression on the part of the foe, we need not assume, as Rosenmller does, "that the Israelites had been constantly harassed by their neighbours, who continued to suppress the liberty of the Israelites, and from whose stratagems or power the Israelites were delivered by the acts of Tola;" but Tola rose up as the deliverer of Israel, even supposing that he simply regulated the affairs of the tribes who acknowledged him as their supreme judge, and succeeded by his efforts in preventing the nation from falling back into idolatry, and thus guarded Israel from any fresh oppression on the part of hostile nations. Tola was the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, of the tribe of Issachar. The names Tola and Puah are already met with among the descendants of Issachar, as founders of families of the tribes of Issachar (see <a href="/genesis/46-13.htm">Genesis 46:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23</a>, where the latter name is written &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;), and they were afterwards repeated in the different households of these families. Dodo is not an appellative, as the Sept. translators supposed (&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), but a proper name, as in <a href="/2_samuel/23-9.htm">2 Samuel 23:9</a> (Keri), 24, and <a href="/1_chronicles/11-12.htm">1 Chronicles 11:12</a>. The town of Shamir, upon the mountains of Ephraim, where Tola judged Israel, and was afterwards buried, was a different place from the Shamir upon the mountains of Judah, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>, and its situation (probably in the territory of Issachar) is still unknown.</body></html>
