DO NOT READ THIS BOOK WHEN DISCOURAGED!<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">The reason? Judges faithfully records an unedited account of the saddest, most sordid and shameful period in the entire Old Testament. It is the Dark Ages in Israel’s history. Chapters 17-21 in this book are probably the most depressing in all the Bible. In brief, Judges speaks of seven apostasies on Israel’s part, seven servitudes to seven heathen nations, and seven deliverances. Judges thus can be summarized by four words:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Sin: Israel turns from the living God<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Slavery: God allows pagan nations to occupy the land<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Supplication: Israel forsakes its sin and prays for deliverance<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Salvation: God graciously raises up judges to deliver Israel<p class="spc"></p><p class="reg">In reality these judges (13 in number) were not legal experts (as the title might suggest), but rather military leaders.<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Facts Regarding the Author of this Book</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Who? <b>Samuel.</b> He was the son of Hannah (1 Sam. 1:19, 20) who anointed both Saul and David as king over Israel (1 Sam. 9:27-10:1; 16:13).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> What?

When Moses died, God looked around and found a man who could take his place—Joshua. But at the death of Joshua, no man could be found who would pick up his fallen banner. Heaven, like the military here on earth, is still looking for a few good men (and women). The following phrase is found four times in Judges: <i>“In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes”</i> (17:6, see also 18:1; 19:1; 21:25). This period is thus the antithesis of the millennium when King Jesus will rule with a rod of iron (Psa. 2).<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> The <u>fruit</u> of Israel’s problem was really two-fold:<p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Compromise: Israel was guilty of not doing what God had commanded the nation to do, that is, drive out its enemies (see 1:21, 27-33; 2:1-5).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Apostasy: Israel was guilty of doing what God had commanded her not to do, that is, worship the gods of her enemies (see 2:11-13).<p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> Israel’s moral condition grew progressively worse as the downward cycle was repeated. Each time a judge died, <i>“the people returned to their corrupt ways, behaving worse than those who had lived before them”</i> (2:19).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> In spite of all this, God still loved his people. In the Old Testament the angel of the Lord is mentioned 80 times. It is thought by most theologians that the Angel of the Lord was none other than Christ himself. No less than 20 of these instances are found in the book of Judges. In addition to the ministry of the Son of God, the Holy Spirit of God came upon and empowered many of the judges. Thus, during no other biblical period in the Old Testament did God minister more to his people than at this time.<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> The first biblical battle fought at a place called Megiddo occurs in Judges (5:19). It is thought that heaven’s angels may have aided Israel in this battle (5:20). The last biblical battle takes place at Megiddo (Rev. 16:14). Angels also participate (Rev. 14:18-20).<p class="num"><span class="nm">6.</span> This book marks the first instance of a man refusing the kingship of Israel, and of another attempting to obtain it through bloodshed (8:22; 9:6).<p class="num"><span class="nm">7.</span> Judges records for us the first Nazarite in history and the strongest man who ever lived—Samson! (13:2-5; 15:15).<p class="num"><span class="nm">8.</span> It tells of the man who made the most tragic vow in scripture (11:29-40).<p class="num"><span class="nm">9.</span> It gives the account of an army put to death for mispronouncing a word! (12:6)<p class="num"><span class="nm">10.</span> It includes one of two fables in the Bible (9:7-15). For the other, see 2 Kings 14:9.<p class="num"><span class="nm">11.</span> It speaks of 300 victorious men (7:7) and 600 desperate men (20:46, 47).<p class="num"><span class="nm">12.</span> It provides scripture’s most extended account of throwing out the fleece (6:36-40).<p class="num"><span class="nm">13.</span> It shows how the sovereign God can even use an evil angel to accomplish His will (9:23).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Comparison with Other Bible Books</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="reg"><b>Exodus, Joshua, Hosea, Galatians, First Corinthians:</b><p class="spc"></p><p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Exodus, after the death of Joseph, there arose a new king in Egypt who refused to recognize either the power or purity of almighty God (Ex. 1:8)<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Judges, after the death of Joshua, there arose a new generation in Canaan who made the same fatal error (see 2:10).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Joshua, there is strong, sustained leadership, and unity among the tribes; in Judges there is a sustained leader, and disunity among the tribes.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> In Joshua Israel takes land from the Canaanites; in Judges the Canaanites take land from Israel.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Joshua emphasizes obedience, victory, and freedom; Judges shows disobedience, defeat, and slavery.<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> The final part of Galatians 5 proved an excellent summary of the books of Joshua and Judges (see 5:22-26 concerning Joshua and 5:17-21 concerning Judges). <i>“Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law”</i> (Gal. 5:19-23).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Judges is the classic example of Hosea 8:7 and Gal. 6:7: <i>“For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind”</i> (Hos. 8:7a). <i>“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting”</i> (Gal. 6:7-8).<p class="dot"><span class="dt">•</span> Judges also offers seven illustrations of 1 Cor. 1:27: <i>“But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.”</i> Note: In Judges God used: (1) an ox goad (3:31); (2) a nail (4:21); (3) some trumpets (7:20); (4) some pitchers (7:20); (5) some lamps (7:20); (6) a millstone (9:53); (7) the jawbone of an ass (15:15).<p class="spc"></p><p class="hdg"><B>Titles for and Types of Jesus</B><p class="spc"></p><p class="num"><span class="nm">1.</span> Lord God of Israel (5:5)<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> Angel of the Lord (6:12)<p class="spc"></p></body></html>
