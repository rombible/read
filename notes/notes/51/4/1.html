The apostle here, probably, refers to bondmen or slaves, and the propriety of this rule is apparent. Such persons were subject to their masters' control; their time and services were at their disposal, and they could not enforce their just and equal claims by an appeal to the laws. They were, therefore, dependent on the equity and kindness of their masters. There can be no doubt that not a few who were converted to the Christian faith were held to involuntary servitude (see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>); and it is as clear that the apostles did not design to make a violent disruption of these bonds, or to lead the slaves to rise and murder their masters; see the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1-4</a>. But it is equally clear that they meant to represent slavery as a hard and undesirable condition; that they intended to instruct the slaves to embrace the earliest opportunity to be free which was presented <a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>; and that they meant to suggest such considerations, and to lay down such principles as would lead masters to emancipate their slaves, and thus ultimately to abolish it. Among these principles are such as these:<p>(1) That all men were of one and the same blood; <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>.<p>(2) that they were all redeemed by the same Saviour, and were brethren; <a href="/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>; Plm 1:16. If redeemed; if they were "brethren;" if they were heirs of glory, they were not "chattels," or "things;" and how could a Christian conscientiously hold or regard them as property?<p>(3) that they were to "render them that which was just and equal." What would follow from this if fairly applied? What would be just and equal to a man in those circumstances? Would it not be.<p>(a) to compensate him fairly for his labor; to furnish him an adequate remuneration for what he had earned? But this would strike a blow at the root of slavery - for one of the elementary principles of it is, that there must be "unrequited labor;" that is, the slave must earn as much more than he receives as will do his part in maintaining the master in idleness, for it is of the very essence of the system that he is to be maintained in indolence by the slaves which he owns - or just so far as he owns a slave. If he were disposed to earn his own living, he would not need the labor of slaves. No one ever yet became the permanent owner of a slave from benevolence to him, or because he desired to pay him fully for his work, or because he meant himself to work in order to maintain his slave in indolence.<p>(b) If a man should in fact render to his slaves "that which is just and equal," would he not restore them to freedom? Have they not been deprived of their liberty by injustice, and would not "justice" restore it? What has the slave done to forfeit his liberty? If he should make him "equal" in rights to himself, or to what he is by nature, would he not emancipate him? Has he not been reduced to his present condition by withholding that which is "equal?" Has he "equal" rights, and "equal" privileges with other men? Has he not been cut off from them by denying him the equality to which he is entitled in the arrangements of God's government? Can he be held at all without violating all the just notions of equality? Though, therefore, it may be true that this passage only enjoins the rendering of that which was" just" and "equal" in their condition as slaves, yet it contains a principle which would" lay the axe at the root" of slavery, and would lead a conscientious Christian to the feeling that his slaves ought to be free. These principles actually effected the freedom of slaves in the Roman empire in a few centuries after Christianity was introduced, and they are destined to effect it yet all over the world.<p>Knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven - Notes, <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>Col 4:1-18.

But <span class="greekheb">ἰσότης</span> is always (even in Polyb. ii. 38. 8) <span class="ital">equality;</span> see <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Plato, <span class="ital">Rep.</span> 658 C, where it is said of the democracy: <span class="greekheb">ἰσότητά τινα ὁμοίως ἴσοις τε καὶ ἀνίσοις διανέμουσα</span>, that is, it distributes uniformly to <span class="ital">equal</span> and <span class="ital">unequal</span> a certain <span class="ital">equality.</span> In such passages the conception of <span class="ital">égalité</span> comes into view with special clearness. Hofmann has explained our passage as if <span class="greekheb">ἰσότης</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁμαλότης</span> or <span class="greekheb">λειότης</span> (<span class="ital">levelness</span>), were identical conceptions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἰσότητα</span>. The literal meaning is “equality,” and Meyer takes it so here (so Ol., Haupt), explaining not of equality conferred by emancipation, but of the treatment of the slave by his master as a brother in Christ. It may, in spite of Oltramare’s denial, mean “equity,” and the combination with <span class="greekheb">δίκ</span>. suggests this meaning here. The master should regulate his treatment of his slave not by caprice, but by equity.—<span class="greekheb">παρέχεσθε</span>: “supply on your part,” a dynamic middle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a>.

The word in the classics often means “equality” in the political sense, as against arbitrary privilege; and the Gospel, by publishing for ever the spiritual equality of all men before God, secures all that is vital in that matter. But the meaning “<span class="ital">impartiality</span>,” “<span class="ital">equity</span>,” is more in place here; the master is not commanded to surrender his status, but to respect the interests of the slave as faithfully as his own, and to banish caprice and favouritism. This, consistently carried out, was a long and sure step towards the end of slavery; for nothing could be a more direct contradiction to the root-idea of ancient slavery.
