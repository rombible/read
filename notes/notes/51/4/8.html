They have one Lord, though they have different stations and powers for service. It is a great comfort under the troubles and difficulties of life, to have fellow Christians caring for us. Circumstances of life make no difference in the spiritual relation among sincere Christians; they partake of the same privileges, and are entitled to the same regards. What amazing changes Divine grace makes!

So <a href="/ephesians/6-22.htm" title="Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.">Ephesians 6:22</a>, where see our note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the same purpose</span>] <span class="bld">For this very purpose</span>, R.V.

The “<span class="ital">purpose</span>” is that just stated (<a href="/colossians/4-8.htm" title=" Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;">Colossians 4:8</a>), and now more fully explained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that he might know</span>] <span class="bld">That ye might know</span>, R.V. This is the more probable reading, though the text has considerable support, particularly in early Versions. Lightfoot urges for the change (besides manuscripts) that it is unlikely that St Paul should so emphasize (“<span class="ital">for this very purpose</span>”) Tychicus’ <span class="ital">mission of information</span>, and then suddenly give as its first object <span class="ital">a work of enquiry</span>. Further, that transcribers were more likely to assimilate the person and number of the verb to the “<span class="ital">he might comfort</span>” just below, than elaborately to assimilate a “<span class="ital">he might know</span>” here to the “<span class="ital">ye might know</span>” in Ephesians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">comfort</span>] See on <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/4-8.htm" title=" Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;">Colossians 4:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γνῷ τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν</span>) <span class="greekheb">γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν</span> is found in Al.

See App. Crit. Ed. 2.[30] on this passage. The two epistles [Ephesians and Colossians] truly have many points of resemblance to one another, but yet so as that the things that need to be changed are changed in each respectively (mutatis mutandis). And generally in parallelisms of this sort, which the officiousness of transcribers has <span class="ital">mixed together</span> [blending the parallel readings of two epistles into one], <span class="ital">one</span> reading in the one place, and <span class="ital">another</span> in the other, is the genuine reading. Tychicus, and through Tychicus (as it appears) Paul, was to learn the state of the <span class="ital">Colossians</span> (whence, instead of <span class="greekheb">γνῷ</span> [third person, viz. Tychicus], <span class="greekheb">γνῶ</span> [first person, viz. Paul] may be also read), just as he learned the state of the Thessalonians through Timothy; that of the Corinthians through Titus; that of the Philippians through Epaphroditus; and more especially did Paul wish to learn that of the Colossians, because he had a great ‘conflict’ on their account [ch. <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>]. Moreover the knowledge of the Colossians concerning Paul is sufficiently indicated (marked), not only by the preceding words, as in the Epistle to the Ephesians, but also by those following, which are peculiar to this Epistle to the Colossians: <span class="greekheb">πάντα ὑμῖν γνωριοῦσι τὰ ὧδε</span>.[31]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[30] <span class="greekheb">Γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν</span> is the reading of ABD corrected, (<span class="greekheb">Δ</span>), G<span class="ital">fg</span>, and so Lachm.

The Received Text reads, by a slight confusion of similar Greek letters, <span class="accented">that he may know the things about you</span> (see Lightfoot's 'Notes on some Various Readings'). This is the only clause exactly identical in Colossians and Ephesians. There would be great anxiety on St. Paul's account amongst the Gentile Christians everywhere, and especially in the Asiatic Churches, after the ominous words of his address to the Ephesian elders (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-25</a>: comp. vers. 37, 38).
