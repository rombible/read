In this case it is curious that one who bore our Lord’s name should also have been known by a surname which was His peculiar title, “the Just One.” (See <a href="/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a>; and comp. <a href="/luke/23-47.htm" title="Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.">Luke 23:47</a>.)

If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Jesus, who is called Justus - The name Jesus was probably that which he bore among the Jews.

It is accordingly to be explained: <span class="ital">Of those, who are from the circumcision, these alone</span> (simply these three, and no others) <span class="ital">are such fellow-labourers for the kingdom of the Messiah, as have become a comfort to me</span>. The <span class="ital">Jewish-Christian</span> teachers, consequently, worked even at Caesarea to a great extent in an anti-Pauline sense. Comp. the complaint from Rome, <a href="/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-17.htm" title="But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.">Php 1:17</a>. The nominative <span class="greekheb">οἱ ὄντες ἐκ περιτ</span>. puts the <span class="ital">generic</span> subject at the head; but as something is to be affirmed not of the <span class="ital">genus</span>, but of a <span class="ital">special part</span> of it, that general subject remains without being followed out, and by means of the <span class="greekheb">μετάβασις εἰς μέρος</span> the special subject is introduced with <span class="greekheb">οὗτοι</span>, so that the verb (here the <span class="greekheb">εἰσί</span> to be supplied) now attaches itself to the latter. A phenomenon of partitive apposition, which is current also in classical authors. See Kühner, II. 1, p. 246; Nägelsbach and Faesi on Hom <span class="ital">Il</span>. iii. 211. Comp. Matthiae, p. 1307. Hence there is the less reason for breaking up the passage, which runs on simply, after the fashion adopted by Hofmann, who treats <span class="greekheb">ἐκ περιτομῆς οὗτοι μόνοι</span> as inserted parenthetically between <span class="greekheb">οἱ ὄντες</span> and <span class="greekheb">συνεργοί</span>. The complimentary affirmation is to be referred to all the three previously named, without arbitrary exclusion of Aristarchus (in opposition to Hofmann). At any rate, <span class="ital">Caesarea</span> was a city so important for the Christian mission, that many teachers, Jewish-Christian and Gentile-Christian, must have frequented it, especially while Paul was a prisoner there; and consequently the notice in the passage before us need not point us to <span class="ital">Rome</span> as the place of writing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παρηγορία</span>] <span class="ital">consolation, comfort</span>, only here in the N.

Zahn has well pointed out that the mention of this name, in addition to those mentioned in Philemon, creates difficulties for the impugners of the authenticity. If Philemon was authentic why should an imitator venture to add an unknown person, and especially to give him the name Jesus, that so soon became sacred among Christians? If not authentic, why should he not have copied himself?—<span class="greekheb">οἱ ὄντες ἐκ περιτομῆς</span>: to be taken with the following words, in spite of the awkwardness of the construction. What is meant is that these are the only ones of the circumcision who have been a help to him. If a stop is placed at <span class="greekheb">περ</span>., we get the sense that these who have just been mentioned are his only fellow-workers, which is not true. Aristarchus is probably not included, for he went as one of the deputation sent by the Gentile Christians with the collection for the Church at Jerusalem.—<span class="greekheb">οὗτοι μόνοι</span>: for the attitude of Jewish Christians in Rome towards Paul <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/context/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:...">Php 1:15-17</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/2-19.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state....">Php 2:19-24</a>. This is more natural in a letter from Rome than from Cæsarea.—<span class="greekheb">βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>.

"Justus" ("just," "righteous") was frequently adopted by individual Jews, or conferred on them, as a Gentile (Latin) surname (comp. <a href="/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; <a href="/acts/18-7.htm">Acts 18:7</a>); it implied devotion to the Law, and was the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Zadok</span> (see Lightfoot).

Aristarchus, therefore, was a Jew, as well as Mark and Jesus Justus. "These only," etc., must be read as in close apposition to the previous clause.
