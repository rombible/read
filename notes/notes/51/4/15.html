But more probably the whole of the Laodicean Christians are meant in both passages. In their individual character they are “the brethren in Laodicea;” when they are gathered to hear the Epistles they are the” Church (literally, <span class= "ital">the Christian assembly</span>) of Laodicea.”<p><span class= "bld">And Nymphas.</span>—There is a curious variety of reading here. Some MSS. have, as in our version,” the church in his house;” some, “in her house;” the best reading seems to be “in their house.” The second of those readings would make the name “Nympha,” instead of “Nymphas,” with which the form of the original hardly agrees. The last reading (from which the common reading of our version is probably a correction) must refer, in the word “their,” to Nymphas and his family. Of Nymphas we know nothing, except from this passage. He is obviously a man of importance, a centre of Church life, in the Christian community at Laodicea.<p><span class= "bld">The church which is in his house.</span>—This phrase is found elsewhere only as applied to “Aquila and Priscilla” (<a href="/romans/16-5.htm" title="Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19</a>), and to Philemon (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>). Of these Aquila and Priscilla are notable Christian teachers (as of Apostles, <a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>) and confessors (<a href="/romans/16-4.htm" title="Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.">Romans 16:4</a>); and Philemon is spoken of as a “beloved fellow-labourer,” and one in whom “the saints are refreshed” (<a href="/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>). Hence this “church in the house” is seen to have gathered only round persons of some mark and leadership. The houses sanctified by such gatherings were the parents of the material churches of the future.<p>Since the word “church” means nothing more than “general assembly,” it is obviously capable of definition only by the context. If undefined it is universal—the whole Catholic Church of Christ—otherwise it is civic, as is most common; or domestic, as here. Since the units of society were then the family and the city—not the country, or province—we read not of the church, but of the “churches” of Achaia, or Galatia, or Macedonia. National churches there could not be; for nations, as we understand the term, did not exist. Afterwards, when the Church was fully organised, it is well known that the ecclesiastical divisions (“parish,” “diocese,” &c., ) still followed the civil.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea - Notes, <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>.<p>And Nymphas - This person is nowhere else mentioned, and nothing more is known of him.<p>And the church which is in his house - Notes, <a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Perhaps the brethren in Hierapolis (ver. 13) were not formed into a distinct Church as yet (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>).

"His" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) is evidently a later correction. Lightfoot says, indeed, that "a Doric form of the Greek name (<span class="accented">sc.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) seems in the highest degree improbable;" but he allows, on the other hand, that <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> as a contracted masculine form (for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) "is very rare."

Others suppose a more private gathering to be meant, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Colossians living at Laodicea (Meyer).
