He held a “ministry in the Church. The word is the same as the word “diaconate,” but it is obviously used in a more general sense, precisely as in the charge to Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2Timothy 4:5</a>), “Make full proof of thy ministry; “and the whole tone of the passage here suggests that, like Timothy’s, it was a ministry of some prominence in the Church. Tradition makes him afterwards a bishop of Laodicea; it is likely enough that he had that leadership among the presbyters, from which the episcopate was developed at the close of the Apostolic period. Whether this was at Colossæ—his father’s native place—or Laodicea, cannot be gathered with any certainty from the context. The exhortation comes in close connection with Laodicea; yet, on the other hand, it seems strange to send through one church a message to a chief pastor of another. In any case this indirect transmission of a charge is curious, standing in marked contrast with the direct personal addresses of the Philippian Epistle (<a href="/context/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Which thou hast received in the Lord.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">which thou dost receive.</span> The probability seems to be that he received it from St. Paul, or perhaps Epaphras.

It seems he was one of the pastors of the church at Colosse; and many think that he had failed in the duties of his office, and that the apostle, in what he here says, ordered the Colossians to rebuke him publicly for his negligence: but others, perhaps with more truth, and certainly with more charity, as Macknight observes, “are of opinion that the apostle, in this direction, meant that the Colossians should encourage Archippus to diligence, because the false teachers at Colosse were very active in spreading their errors. And their opinion derives probability from the respectful manner in which Archippus is addressed in the epistle to Philemon, which was written about this time, and sent with the epistle to the Colossians.” <span class="ital">Take heed </span>— It is the duty of the flock <span class="ital">to try them that say they are apostles; </span>to reject the false; and to warn, as well as to receive, the true; <span class="ital">to the ministry </span>— Not a lordship, but<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διακονια</span>, <span class="ital">a service, </span>a laborious and painful work; an obligation to do and suffer all things; to be the least, and the servant of all; <span class="ital">which thou hast received in the Lord </span>— Christ, by his appointment; by whom, and for whose sake, his servants receive the various gifts of the Holy Spirit; <span class="ital">that thou fulfil it </span>— Properly; that thou faithfully discharge all the duties of it with diligence and care; for the consequence of neglecting any of them. after having solemnly undertaken to fulfil them, will be infinitely dangerous and fatal.

The apostle’s having suffered now almost four years’ imprisonment for the gospel, and in the course of that time many hardships and dangers, was such a demonstration of his certain knowledge of the truth and importance, yea, and necessity of the gospel to the salvation of mankind, as could not fail to confirm the faith of the Colossians, and of all the Gentiles who were informed of these his sufferings. This probably is the reason that, notwithstanding he had mentioned his bonds twice before in this letter, he brings the subject in a third time here at the conclusion. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And say to Archippus - Archippus is mentioned also in Plm 1:2.

It seems probable from the language which the apostle applies to him - "the ministry" - (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm">Acts 1:17</a>, <a href="/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>; <a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="/acts/21-19.htm">Acts 21:19</a>; <a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-5.htm">1 Corinthians 12:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>), that he was not a deacon, properly so called, but that he was a preacher of the word. In Plm 1:2, he is mentioned by Paul as his "fellow-soldier," and it is evident that the apostle meant to speak of him with honor. There is no evidence, as has been supposed by some, that he intended to imply, by what he said, that he had been remiss in the performance of his duties, but the apostle doubtless meant to encourage him and to excite him to increased ardor and zeal in the work of the Lord; compare the notes at <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>. It is always proper to caution even the most faithful and self-denying servants of the Lord to "take heed," or see to it, that they perform their duties with fidelity.

This proves that Scripture belongs to the laity as well as the clergy; and that laymen may profitably admonish the clergy in particular cases when they do so in meekness. Bengel suggests that Archippus was perhaps prevented from going to the Church assembly by weak health or age. The word, "fulfil," accords with his ministry being near its close (Col 1:25; compare Phm 2). However, "fulfil" may mean, as in 2Ti 4:5, "make full proof of thy ministry."

A name common among the Grecians. This person the apostle calls his fellow soldier, in Plm 1:2 and who was now the minister of the Gospel at Colosse, his fellow minister, or co-pastor Epaphras, being at Rome, and a prisoner there; though by some he is said to be the first bishop of the Laodiceans, but it seems most likely that he now resided at Colosse, and was their minister: who being negligent in his office, they are called upon to say unto him, <p>take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord,  <p>that thou fulfil it. The "ministry" he had, was not that of the office of a deacon, as some have thought, but of a preacher of the word; and this he had "received" gifts for, and was called unto it, and installed in it; and that "in", and "by the Lord" himself, and to whom he was accountable for it: and therefore it was incumbent on him to "fulfil it"; by constantly preaching the word, and faithfully administering the ordinances; by defending truth, detecting error, reproving vice, visiting the sick, and comforting the feeble minded; taking heed in all things to himself and doctrine, that he feed the whole flock of God with wholesome food; and, as a wise and faithful steward, give to everyone their portion of meat in due season: hence it appears, that when ministers are negligent in the discharge of their duty, the church has a power to admonish and exhort them to a diligent performance of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/4-17.htm" title=" And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.">Colossians 4:17</a>.

We cannot gather from <span class="greekheb">ἐν κυρίῳ</span> any more precise definition of the Christian <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span>. Ewald conjectures that Archippus was a still younger man (Bengel holds him to have been sick or weak through age), an overseer of the church, who had been during the absence of Epaphras too indulgent towards the false teachers. Even Fathers like Jerome and the older expositors regard him as bishop (so also Döllinger, <span class="ital">Christenthum u.

Besides, it would be altogether very surprising that Paul should have conveyed the warning admonition to Archippus through a <span class="ital">strange</span> church, the more especially when he had written at the same time to himself jointly addressed with Philemon (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[186] Hitzig, p. 31 (who holds also vv. 9, 15, 16 to be not genuine), gives it as his opinion that Archippus is indebted for this exhortation, not to the apostle, but to the <span class="ital">manipulator,</span> who knew the man indeed from <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>, but probably had in his mind the <span class="ital">Flavius Archippus,</span> well known from Plin. <span class="ital">Ep.</span> x. 66–68, and the <span class="ital">proconsul</span> Paulus, when he adjusted for himself the relation between the <span class="ital">Apostle</span> Paul and his <span class="ital">fellow-warrior Archippus</span> (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>). I do not understand how any one could ascribe even to an interpolator so singular an anachronistic <span class="ital">confusion of persons.</span> Yet Holtzmann finds the grounds of Hitzig so cogent, that he ultimately regards vv. 15–17 as the <span class="ital">rivet,</span> “by means of which the <span class="ital">Auctor ad Ephesios</span> has made a connected triad out of his own work, the interpolated Colossian epistle, and the letter to Philemon.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/4-17.htm" title=" And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.">Colossians 4:17</a>.

He was apparently an ordained minister in the mission-church, either at Colossæ or (less probably, surely; see on <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>) at Laodicea. St Paul, perhaps, had misgivings about his zeal and care, and, without saying as much, aims here at his conscience <span class="ital">through his flock</span>. Or, quite possibly, Archippus had been appointed to take the place of Epaphras when Epaphras left for Rome; and this warning bears only on the thought that his work was just beginning. See further below, p. 152.—In those simple days such an appeal through the people to the pastor was easy; “lordship over God’s heritage” (<a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm" title="Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.">1 Peter 5:3</a>) was no part of the Apostles’ programme of the pastorate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the ministry] Diaconia;</span> Latin Versions, <span class="ital">ministerium</span>. The word in itself has no necessary reference to an <span class="ital">ordained</span> “ministry.” But the context here makes such a reference at least highly probable; Archippus evidently stood out as a “<span class="ital">worker</span>” in a sense quite special and deeply sacred. On the other hand, the reference is probably not to the “diaconate” (<a href="/philippians/1-2.htm" title="Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.">Php 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>, &c.) specially. In Laodicea, as in Philippi, there might well be more than one “deacon.” And the deacon’s office, while sacred and important, was scarcely such as to occasion this solemnity of appeal. Archippus, we believe, was (at least for the time) the chief “pastor and teacher” (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>) of Colossæ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which thou hast received</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">didst receive</span>.

And for St Paul’s own “reception of ministry,” and his ideal of it, see <a href="/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Lord</span>] Pregnant words.

No duty of his ministry was to be ignored; he was to “take heed to <span class="ital">himself, his doctrine</span>, and his flock” (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1 Timothy 4:16</a>).—“A minister of Christ is often in highest honour with men for the performance of one half of his work, while God is regarding him with displeasure for the neglect of the other half” (R. Cecil, quoted by Abp Trench, on <a href="/revelation/3-2.htm" title="Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found your works perfect before God.">Revelation 3:2</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/4-17.htm" title=" And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.">Colossians 4:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἴπατε</span>, <span class="ital">say</span>) Speak ye, in my name, as witnesses. This was more affecting than if he had addressed Archippus himself. And perhaps Archippus, a minister, was prevented from going to the public assembly by weak health or old age. For that he was near the end of his career, may be inferred from the word <span class="ital">fulfil</span>, <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>. Moreover it is not the different overseers of the Church, but the Church itself, which is commanded to speak to <span class="ital">Archippus</span>. Therefore the epistle was directed to the Church, although its subject is very sublime.

From the connection of this verse with the two preceding, it seems likely that "the ministry" of Archippus related to the Laodicean Church. Hence he is not addressed directly. If he was, as we gather from <a href="/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 1, 2</a>, the son of Philemon, whose house formed a centre for the Colossian Church (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>), the warning would be suitably conveyed through this channel. In the letter to Philemon, the apostle calls him his" fellow soldier" (comp. <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29, 30</a>). Both from this fact, and from the emphasis of the words before us, it would appear that his office was an important one, probably that of chief pastor. This warning addressed so early to the minister of the Laodicean Church is premonitory of the lapsed condition in which it is afterwards found (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 42, 43.

This admonition resembles those addressed to Timothy in the Pastoral Epistles. </body></html>
