As heaven and earth are contrary one to the other, both cannot be followed together; and affection to the one will weaken and abate affection to the other. Those that are born again are dead to sin, because its dominion is broken, its power gradually subdued by the operation of grace, and it shall at length be extinguished by the perfection of glory. To be dead, then, means this, that those who have the Holy Spirit, mortifying within them the lusts of the flesh, are able to despise earthly things, and to desire those that are heavenly. Christ is, at present, one whom we have not seen; but our comfort is, that our life is safe with him. The streams of this living water flow into the soul by the influences of the Holy Spirit, through faith. Christ lives in the believer by his Spirit, and the believer lives to him in all he does. At the second coming of Christ, there will be a general assembling of all the redeemed; and those whose life is now hid with Christ, shall then appear with him in his glory.

The true Church is now militant. Rome errs in trying to set up a Church now regnant and triumphant. The true Church shall be visible as a perfect and reigning Church, when Christ shall be visibly manifested as her reigning Head. Rome having ceased to look for Him in patient faith, has set up a visible mockhead, a false anticipation of the millennial kingdom. The Papacy took to itself by robbery that glory which is an object of hope, and can only be reached by bearing the cross now. When the Church became a harlot, she ceased to be a bride who goes to meet her Bridegroom.

The Vulgate Latin version, and some copies, read, "your life". Christ is the author of spiritual life, the fountain from whence it springs, the object on which the saints live, yea, their very life itself; it is not so much they that live, as Christ that lives in them: and he is their eternal life; it is in him, and given forth by him; to know him now is the beginning of it; and its perfection hereafter will lie in the vision of him, communion with him, and conformity to him. The Jews have a saying (y), <p>"that lives depend upon the son of Jesse,'' <p>all sorts of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal. At present, Christ, the life of his people, is, as it were, hid; when he had done the work he came into this world about, and which he was manifest in the flesh, he departed out of it, ascended up into heaven, and went to his God and Father, where he is, and will be retained, until the time of the restitution of all things; and though he appears in the presence of God, and on the behalf of his redeemed ones, yet he is now out of sight, and not to be seen with their bodily eyes; but, ere long, he will be revealed from heaven, and come in the clouds of it, and be seen by all, to the terror and confusion of some, and to the joy and salvation of others; when his appearance will be exceeding glorious, not only in his glorified body, or exalted human nature, and as the Judge of the whole earth, clothed with majesty, authority, and power, but as the Son of God, God equal with the Father, in all the perfections and glory of deity, which will be manifest and apparent to everyone: <p>then shall ye also appear with him in glory: the dead bodies of the saints will then be raised and united to their souls, which he will bring with him, when he appears; and living saints shall be changed, and be caught up together with the raised ones, into the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so they all shall be with him together, wherever he is, whether in the air, or on earth, or in heaven, and while he is in either; and shall be for ever with him, enjoy communion with him, be made like unto him, and behold his glory: yea, they shall "appear in glory" too; with a glory on their bodies, which will be raised in glory like unto the glorious body of Christ; and on their souls, being in perfect holiness, having on the wedding garment, or robe of Christ's righteousness, being clothed upon with their house from heaven, and appearing in the shining robes of immortality, incorruption, and glory; having the glory of God upon them in soul and body, and such a glory revealed in them, as the sufferings of this present life, and all the enjoyments of it, are not to be compared with. All which furnish out strong arguments and reasons, enforcing the above exhortations to seek for, and set the affections on things in heaven, and not on earth. <p>(y) Zohar in Gen. fol. 2. 3. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>.

The Holy Spirit is “the Lord, the Life-<span class="ital">Giver</span>” (Nicene Creed); but <span class="ital">the Life</span> is the Son of God, as the Redeemer and Head of His saints.—Cp. <a href="/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.">John 6:57</a>; <a href="/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>; <a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son....">1 John 5:11-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Our life</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—he has just said, “<span class="ital">your</span> life is hid, &c.”; now he “hastens to include himself among the recipients of the bounty” (Lightfoot).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall ye also appear</span>] <span class="bld">be manifested</span>. “<span class="ital">It hath not yet been manifested what we shall be</span>” (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1 John 3:2</a>). The believer has a supernatural secret of peace and holiness, but it is hidden; and the Divine <span class="ital">quality</span> of the effects will not be fully “manifested” till the Cause is “manifested.” Again, the effects, though in a partial sense “manifested” even now, “in our <span class="ital">mortal flesh</span>” (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-11.htm" title="For we which live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.">2 Corinthians 4:11</a>), are as to their Divine <span class="ital">quantity</span> still “hidden,” till the final glorification of the saints. Then, the oneness of the members with their Head will be seen, in all its living power and wonder, and their perfect holiness will be discovered to be <span class="ital">all</span> “of Him.” So “the sons of God will be <span class="ital">manifested</span>” (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>) in respect of the nature and the greatness of their sonship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle’s practical aim is to bring his converts to use their “hidden” life the more freely and confidently, in view of its promised issues, and to cheer them by the same prospects under the cross of sorrow, temptation, limitation, or whatever else “conceals,” in God’s present order, their life eternal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with him</span>] from whom the glorified are never separated. Cp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in glory</span>] His glory, the effulgence, visible and spiritual, of His presence; shared by His members.
