neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>. There are, however, constantly emerging indications of independence of handling. Generally speaking, the Ephesian Epistle is fuller and deeper in treatment; and, moreover, it constantly brings out, in relation both to moral duty and to the observation of the relations of life, the great characteristic doctrine of the universal unity in Christ. This Epistle, on the other hand, is briefer and more incisive, and has only slight, though clear, indications of the idea so powerfully worked out in the other Epistle.)]<p><a href="/context/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5-9</a> contain the negative section of St. Paul’s practical appeal, drawing out the consequences of the “death with Christ,” in the mortification of all tendencies to impurity, malice, and falsehood. For these are the opposites to purity, love, and truth—the three great attributes of God, and therefore the three chief graces of man.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.</span>—The expression is doubly unique. It is the only passage where “mortification”—the killing of anything in us—is enjoined; and it is also notable, as not explicitly distinguishing between the members themselves, and the evil of which they are made the instruments. The sense is, of course, clear enough. It corresponds to the “crucifying the flesh” of <a href="/galatians/5-24.htm" title="And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.">Galatians 5:24</a>; and the idea of evil, mostly expressed plainly in the word “flesh,” is here hinted in the phrase “which are on the earth,” that is, which are busied with earth and bind us down to the earthly life. The particular word “members” is perhaps suggested by our Lord’s command to “cut off the right hand” and “pluck out the right eye” if they cause us to offend (<a href="/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.">Matthew 5:29-30</a>). But, as a rule, Scripture more clearly marks the distinction between the members and “the law of sin in the members” (<a href="/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.">Romans 7:5</a>; <a href="/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>); and we are usually bidden not to “kill our members,” but to turn them from “instruments of unrighteousness” to be “instruments of righteousness unto God” (<a href="/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>). The fact is that this passage contains only half the truth, corresponding to the death with Christ, and not the whole truth, including also the resurrection to the new life. Accordingly, as the next verse shows, the members to be mortified are actually identified with the vices of the old man residing in them.<p><span class= "bld">Fornication, uncleanness . . . covetousness, which is idolatry.</span>—See <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>, and Note there.<p><span class= "bld">Inordinate affection, evil concupiscence.</span>—These words are not found in the parallel passage. The word rendered “inordinate affection” is the general word for “passion” (<span class= "ital">pathos</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> It is found united to “concupiscence” in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm" title="Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:">1Thessalonians 4:5</a>, “the lust of concupiscence.” Both words here are general words, denoting the condition of soul, of which “fornication” and “covetousness” are both exemplifications. This is the condition of unrestrained passion and desire, the former word implying a passive receptiveness of impression from without, the other the positive energy of desire to seek gratification. Comp. <a href="/galatians/5-24.htm" title="And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.">Galatians 5:24</a>, “the affections” (<span class= "ital">passions</span>) and “lusts.” Of such a temper Article IX. of the Church of England declares with singular accuracy, not that it is sin, but that it has in itself <span class= "ital">rationem peccati, </span>that is, the initial principle of sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/colossians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:...">Colossians 3:5-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Mortify therefore </span>— Put to death, slay with a continued stroke; <span class="ital">your members </span>— The members of the old man, which together make up the body of sin; inclinations and dispositions which spread themselves through all the members of the body, and draw even them into a compliance with themselves; <span class="ital">which are upon the earth </span>— Where they find their nourishment, or which are earthly, inclining to earthly things, and wholly engaged about them. <span class="ital">Uncleanness </span>— In act, word, or thought; <span class="ital">inordinate affection </span>— Every passion which does not flow from, and lead to, the love of God; <span class="ital">evil concupiscence </span>— Or desire, namely, the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life. <span class="ital">Covetousness </span>— The desire of <span class="ital">having more, </span>as the word signifies, or <span class="ital">of any thing </span>independent of God; <span class="ital">which is idolatry </span>— Properly and directly, for it is giving the heart to a creature, putting that trust in a creature which ought to be placed in the Creator, and seeking that happiness in a creature which can only be found in God, and ought therefore only to be sought in him. <span class="ital">For which things’ sake </span>— Though the carnal and sensual regard them lightly; <span class="ital">the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience </span>— Even on the heathen themselves, who bid the most open defiance even to the first principles of all true religion.

For Colosse being a city of Phrygia, where the rites of Bacchus and those of Cybele, consisting of all sorts of lewdness in speech and action, were practised with a frantic kind of madness, the Colossians, no doubt, had been much addicted to these gross impurities in their heathen state.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:5-11 It is our duty to mortify our members which incline to the things of the world. Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mortify therefore your members - Since you are dead to sin and the world, and are to appear with Christ in the glories of his kingdom, subdue every carnal and evil propensity of your nature.

The word "members" here, refers to the different members of the body - as the seat of evil desires and passions; compare the notes at <a href="/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>.

The meaning here is:<p>(1) that it is a low and debasing passion, like those which he had specified; and,<p>(2) that it secures the affections which properly belong to God, and is, therefore, idolatry. Of all base passions, this is the one that most dethrones God from the soul.

Mortify&#8212;Greek, "make a corpse of"; "make dead"; "put to death."<p>therefore&#8212;(See on [2420]Col 3:3). Follow out to its necessary consequence the fact of your having once for all died with Christ spiritually at your regeneration, by daily "deadening your members," of which united "the body of the sins of the flesh" consists (compare Col 2:11). "The members" to be mortified are the fleshly instruments of lust, in so far as the members of the body are abused to such purposes. Habitually repress and do violence to corrupt desires of which the members are the instruments (compare Ro 6:19; 8:13; Ga 5:24, 25).<p>upon the earth&#8212;where they find their support [Bengel] (Compare Col 3:2, "things on earth").

It implies a self-idolizing, grasping spirit; far worse than another Greek term translated "the love of money" (1Ti 6:10).<p>which is&#8212;that is, inasmuch as it is "idolatry." Compare Note, see on [2421]Eph 4:19, on its connection with sins of impurity. Self and mammon are deified in the heart instead of God (Mt 6:24; see on [2422]Eph 5:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That they might not think he, who had given check to superstitious abstinences, was for the indulging of any carnal affections, he infers here, how the exercise of truly Christian mortification was incumbent on those who were dead to sin and had their life hid in Christ. Neither is it any incongruity, that they who are in a sort already dead should be exhorted to mortification, if we do but distinctly consider of mortification, and what they are to mortify, or endeavour to make dead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. As to mortification; which may be considered either as to its inchoation, when, upon effectually calling, a mortal wound is by the Spirit of God given to the old man, or to the habit of sin, which will in the end or consummation be a total privation of its life, though as yet it be but partial. It is not in regard of this inchoative mortification, which was begun upon their effectual calling, that the apostle exhorts the saints at Colosse in this verse to mortify. But mortification may be considered as to its continuation, and the carrying on the life of grace, in the making dead all that is contrary to it; even the renewed person should be continually solicitous to have the old man killed outright without any reprieve. This is it that the apostle put the believing Colossians upon, not to spare any remaining ill dispositions or depraved habits of the old man; but by the assistance of the Spirit, (for it is not a natural, but spiritual work), <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a> <a href="/galatians/5-24.htm" title="And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.">Galatians 5:24</a></span>, continually to resist to the killing of it, or putting it to death: never to desist in this war. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. As to the earthly members of it. The apostle expresseth the object of mortification, or what they are to mortify, by their <span class="bld">members upon the earth; </span> not as if he designed to put them upon a dismembering of their bodies, or a deadening of those bodily natural parts whereby the sex is distinguished, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a></span>, (though, agreeably to his own practice, he would have the body kept under and brought into subjection, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1 Corinthians 9:27</a></span>), but upon subduing inordinate motions and carnal concupiscences, as is evident from the particular vices following, which, taken as collected and heaped up together, may well pass under the notion of a body.

Not your bodies, as the Ethiopic version reads, nor the members of the natural body, but of the body of sin, indwelling sin; which as a body consists of various members, which are parts of it, rise out of it, and are used by it, as the members are by the body; and intend the sins of the flesh, or sinful actions, which are generally performed by the members of the natural body, in which the law of sin is, and by which it operates; so that the mortification the saints are here exhorted to, in consideration of having a spiritual life in them, and a hope of eternal life in Christ, from whence the apostle argues, is not a mortification or destruction of the body of sin itself, or of the being and principle of it in the soul, where it is, and lives, and dwells, and will as long as the saints are in this tabernacle, but of the deeds of the body, or of sinful actions, as to the life and conversation; and signifies a denial of them, an abstinence from them, and a non-performance of them; See Gill on <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>. These members, or deeds of the body, or acts of sin, are called "your": for as the old man is ours, the vitiosity of nature is what we bring into the world with us, and is rooted and incorporated into us; so the actions that flow from it, and are done by it, are not to be ascribed to God, nor even to Satan, but they are our own actions, and which are performed by the members of our mortal body, or by the faculties of our souls: and are, <p>which are on earth: or earthly; are concerned about earthly things, the things of the world, worldly lusts and pleasures, which rise out of earthly mindedness, and incline unto it, and are only what are done here on earth, and will have no place in heaven. The particulars of which follow: <p>fornication; the sin of uncleanness committed by single persons, or out of the state of marriage, and which the Gentiles did not account sinful: hence so much notice is taken of it, with a censure, and so often, by the apostle, in almost all his epistles, and dehorted from, as a sin against the body, as what disqualified for church communion, and was not to be named among the saints, who should be dead to that, and that to them, as to the commission of it. <p>Uncleanness; of every sort, all other impure actions, as adultery, incest, sodomy, and every other unnatural lust; all which should be abstained from, and never committed by those who profess to be alive unto God. <p>Inordinate affection; which may intend the passions, or first motions of sin, stirred up by the law, and which work in, and operate by the members of the body, and bring forth fruit unto death, and therefore to be opposed by such as have a life in Christ; and also those vile affections, which some in a judicial way are given up unto, and prevail with those who are effeminate, and abusers of themselves with mankind, and which are to be abhorred and denied by all who are heirs of the grace of life, and expectants of an heavenly one. <p>Evil concupiscence; so called to distinguish it from that natural concupiscence, or desire after things lawful and necessary, and which is implanted in nature by God himself; and from that spiritual concupiscence or desire after spiritual things, and that lusting against the flesh and carnal things, which is formed in the heart of a regenerate man by the Spirit of God. It is the same with , "the evil imagination", or corruption of nature so much spoken of by the Jews. This here is what is forbidden by that law, "thou shalt not covet", <a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>; and includes every fleshly lust and inordinate desire, or every desire after that which is not lawful, or does not belong to a man; as what is another's property, his wife, or goods, or anything that is his; and so very naturally follows, <p>covetousness; an immoderate love of money, the root of all evil, an insatiable desire of having more, and of having more than a man's own; and is enlarged as hell, and as death is not satisfied, but still craves more, without making any good use of what is possessed: <p>which is idolatry. The covetous man, and the idolater, worship the same for matter and substance, even gold and silver; the covetous man lays up his money, makes no use of it, as if it was something sacred; he looks at it, and adores it, and puts his trust and confidence in it, and his heart is so much set upon it, that he neglects the worship of the true God; and indeed no man can serve God and mammon. Some think, that by this rendered "covetousness", is meant, that greedy desire after the commission of all uncleanness, and impure actions, which were perpetrated by the followers of Simon Magus in their religious assemblies, and under the notion of worship, and as acceptable to God, and therefore called idolatry; and which ought not to be once named, much less practised, among the living members of Christ. Moreover, such filthy actions were performed by the Gentiles in the worship of their deities. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Mortify therefore your <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</span><p>(6) Let not your dead nature be effectual in you any more, but let your living nature be effectual.

It seems strange that the assertions in the previous verses, of their death and resurrection with Christ and hidden life with Him in God, should be followed by the exhortation to put their members to death. Clearly these assertions are idealistic. The death and resurrection potentially theirs are to be realised in the putting to death of their members,—<span class="greekheb">τὰ μέλη τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span>.

He thinks Paul intended to make these accusatives directly dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἀπ</span>., but, owing to the intervening clauses, changed the form of the sentence. It is true that the apposition of <span class="greekheb">μέλη</span> and the list of sins that follows is strange, but not so strange as to make this very forced construction preferable. We should have expected <span class="greekheb">ἀπ</span>. at the beginning of the sentence.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν πλεονεξίαν</span>: “and covetousness,” not “impurity”.

Its plain meaning is to reduce to a state of death, or like death; a state helpless, inoperative.

His language has approached that of the philosophical ascetics (see <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, note and quotations); hence the abrupt explanatory apposition that follows: <span class="cmt_word">fornication, uncleanness,</span> (sensual) <span class="cmt_word">passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry</span> (<a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>). To these vices the Colossian Gentiles (some of them at least) had been to such a degree devoted that their <span class="accented">members</span> had become virtually identified therewith. The first two sins are related as particular and general. The second pair, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, are combined in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> in contrast to "(bodily) sanctification and honour" (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, and "passions of dishonour," <a href="/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>). The former denotes a morbid, inflamed condition of the sensual appetite; the latter, craving for some particular gratification of it (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). Neither of these words is etymologically, or invariably, evil in sense. The degradation of such terms in all languages is a sad evidence of the corruption of our nature. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is both wider and more intense in meaning than our "covetousness." It denotes radically the disposition to "have more," "grasping greed," "selfishness grown to a passion." Hence it applies to sins of impurity, greediness for sensual pleasure (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>); but by the emphatic use of the article ("the covetousness"), and by the words that follow, it is marked out as a distinct type of sin; so in <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>, where "uncleanness" and "greed" are stigmatized as <span class="accented">vile</span> forms of sin. This word, often used by St. Paul, is peculiar to him in the New Testament. "The which" (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: setup. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>) gives a reason while it states a fact ("inasmuch as it is idolatry"). For the thought, setup. <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, also <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; it is a commonplace of religion, and appears in Philo and Jewish rabbis (see Lightfoot). Lightfoot places a colon after "upon the earth," and supposes "fornication," etc., to be "proleptic accusatives," looking forward to some verb unexpressed, such as "put off" (ver. 8). But this is needless (see Winer, p. 666), and the command, "make dead your members," requires this qualifying explanation. The grammatical awkwardness of the apposition is not without rhetorical effect. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Mortify (&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Only here, <a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a>.
