The elect are “holy,” consecrated to God in thought and life; and “beloved,” accepted and sustained in their consecration by His love. Both epithets belong to them as conformed to the image of Christ (Rev. 8:29); for He is “the Holy One of God” (<a href="/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us?

But the enumeration here is more exact in order of idea. St. Paul starts with the natural and universal instinct of compassion or sympathy; he next dwells on “kindliness and lowliness of mind,” which are closely akin, since readiness to oblige others grows naturally out of a self-neglectful humility; from these he passes to “gentleness and long-suffering “in case of injury, ready” to forbear and to forgive; lastly, from these particulars he rises to the general spirit of “love,” ruling under “the peace of God.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/colossians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;...">Colossians 3:12-13</a>. </span><span class="ital">Put on therefore </span>— In a higher degree than before; <span class="ital">as the elect, </span>or chosen, <span class="ital">of God — </span>The appellation given in the New Testament to all the true disciples of Christ, to all that so believe in him as to be pardoned and renewed; see on <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a> : <span class="ital">holy </span>— Dedicated and conformed to him; <span class="ital">and beloved </span>— By him, or set apart to his service, and blessed with the tokens of his peculiar favour. <span class="ital">Bowels of mercies </span>— <span class="greekheb">Οικτιρμων</span>, <span class="ital">of tender mercies, </span>namely, toward all the afflicted, destitute, and distressed, especially those of the household of faith; <span class="ital">kindness </span>— Benevolence toward one another and all men, or <span class="ital">sweetness of disposition, </span>as <span class="greekheb">χρηστοτης </span>properly signifies; <span class="ital">humbleness of mind </span>— In your behaviour toward others, engaging you to condescend even to those that are in the lowest stations of life; <span class="ital">meekness </span>— Under whatever injuries or provocations you may receive, always restraining you from returning evil for evil, railing for railing, and from resenting any injury that may be done to you; <span class="ital">long-suffering </span>— Amidst the failings, weaknesses, and faults of your fellow-Christians; or when your trials, whether immediately from the hand of God or man, are either continued long, or are violent in their degree; <span class="ital">forbearing </span>— Or patiently bearing with one another, if any thing is now wrong; <span class="ital">and forgiving one another </span>— What is past; <span class="ital">if any man have a quarrel </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μομφην</span>, <span class="ital">complaint; against any: even as Christ forgave you,</span> &c. — And thereby set you an example, that you might be always disposed to forgive the faults of your offending fellow-Christians or fellow- creatures.

Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him.

As the apostle had argued for the putting off of the members of the body, from their having put off the old man himself; so he now argues from their having put on the new man, to their putting on of his members; that is, to the exercise of the various graces of the Spirit, and the discharge of the several duties of religion; which though they would not be a robe of righteousness, or garments of salvation to them, yet would be very becoming conversation garments, such as would be adorning to themselves, to the doctrine of Christ, and their profession of it, without which they would be naked in their walk, and exposed to shame,  , "to be clothed with the Holy Spirit", is a phrase used by the Cabalistic doctors (d); and is indeed a Scripture phrase, "the Spirit of the Lord came upon",  clothed Zechariah, <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a> and so Esther is said, by the Jewish writers (e), to be "clothed with the Holy Ghost" Here the metaphor is taken from the putting off of clothes; and what is here directed to, is like Joseph's coat, a coat of many colours. The arguments made use of lie in the characters under which the saints are addressed, <p>as the elect of God, holy and beloved; that is, "as becomes the elect of God", as the Arabic version renders it; as such who were chosen in Christ from eternity, according to the sovereign will and pleasure of God, and his free grace unto salvation and eternal life; which carries in it a strong argument to enforce the performance of good works, since men are hereby chosen unto holiness, and good works are what God has foreordained that they should walk in, and especially to mercy, and acts of it; since hereby their salvation appears to be not of man's will and works, but of God, that shows mercy; and such who are the objects of this grace are vessels of mercy. The apostle calls all the members of this church by this name, though every individual of them might not be chosen of God; but because they were all under a visible profession of faith and holiness, and the greater part of them were truly believers, he in a judgment of charity gives them all this appellation, and upon the same foot, the next, "holy"; not by birth, for they were by nature unclean and filthy, conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity; nor by baptism, which takes away neither original nor actual sin, but leaves men as it finds them, and who ought to be holy before they partake of that; but in Christ imputatively, as he was made of God unto them sanctification; and by him efficaciously, in virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, by which he sanctifies his people; and by his spirit inherently and internally, who is the author of the work of sanctification in the heart; and they were likewise so externally in a professional way, and therefore it highly became them to exercise and practise the following graces and duties, to which they were still more obliged, inasmuch as they were "beloved"; that is, of God, as appeared both from their election and sanctification. God had loved them, and therefore had chosen them in his Son, and had given his Son to die for them, that he might sanctify them; and because of his great love to them, had quickened them when dead in sin, and sanctified them by his spirit: wherefore, since God had so loved them, they ought to show love again to him, and to one another, and put on <p>bowels of mercies; a sympathizing spirit with saints in distress, weeping with them that weep, suffering with them that suffer, being touched, as their high priest is, with a feeling of their sorrows and weaknesses: it denotes inward pity and compassion to distressed objects, the most tender regard to persons in misery, and such compassion as is free from all hypocrisy and deceit, and therefore is expressed by "bowels"; and what is very large, and reaches to multitudes of objects, and is displayed and exerted various ways, and therefore signified by "mercies". Now such a spirit is a very beautiful one; the apostle begins with the innermost of these garments, adding to it <p>kindness, which is this inward, tender, unfeigned, and abundant mercy put into act and exercise; this is doing good to all men, especially to the household of faith, distributing to the necessities of the saints, and a showing mercy with cheerfulness, and is very ornamental to a Christian professor: as is also <p>humbleness of mind; which lies in the saints entertaining mean thoughts of themselves, looking upon themselves as the chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints; as inferior to others in knowledge, experience, gifts, and graces; in esteeming others better than themselves; in ascribing all they have, and are, to the grace of God; in doing works of mercy and righteousness without ostentation, and boasting of them, or depending on them; owning, that when they have done all they can, they are but unprofitable servants; and this is a beautiful dress for a believer to appear in: be ye clothed with humility; see <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>. And of the like nature is <p>meekness; which shows itself in not envying the gifts and graces, the usefulness and happiness of others, but rejoicing therein; in quietly submitting to the will of God in all adverse dispensations of Providence, and patiently bearing what he is pleased to lay on them; and in enduring all the insults, reproaches, and indignities of men with calmness. This ornament of a meek and quiet, spirit is in the sight of God of great price, <a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>.

Their whole Christian standing springs from and witnesses to God's eternal (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>) <span class="accented">election</span> of them - an election which, however, presumes faith on their part from beginning to end (<a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="/romans/9-30.htm">Romans 9:30-33</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5-10, 17-24</a>). "Elect" and "called," with St. Paul, are coextensive terms: comp. <a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a> (R.V.) with this passage, also <a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26, 27</a>. To address the Colossian Christians as <span class="accented">elect</span> is to remind them of all that they owe to God's grace. "Elect" as chosen by God, they are "holy" as devoted to God. By the latter title they were first addressed (<a href="/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>); holiness is the essence of Christian character. That they should gain this character and appear in it at the last judgment was the purpose of Christ's atoning death (<a href="/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21, 22</a>), as it was the purpose of God's eternal election of believers (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). "And" is marked as doubtful by Lightfoot, Westcott and Heft; "it is impossible not to feel how much the sentence gains in form by its omission" (Lightfoot). "Beloved" (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is the perfect participle passive; it describes the position of those who, carrying out by their present holiness the purpose of their past election, are the objects of God's abiding love (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). This love dictated their election and set at work the means by which it should be secured (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30, 39</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9, 10</a>). As its purposes are increasingly fulfilled in them, it rests on them with an abiding complacency and satisfaction (<a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a>; <a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21-23</a>). Christ is "the beloved One" (<a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.), and those who are "in him" in their measure share the same title (<a href="/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23-26</a>). But their choice by God and devotion to God, who is all love to them (<a href="/romans/8-39.htm">Romans 8:39</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>), must in turn beget a loving heart in them (<a href="/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A heart of pity, kindness, lowliness of mind, meekness, long suffering</span> (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1, 2, 32-5:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1-4</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8, 9</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5, 7</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35, 36</a>). "The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> are properly the nobler viscera" rather than <span class="accented">the bowels.</span> The use of this figure, found three times in Philemon, is Hebraistic (comp. <a href="/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7, 12, 20</a>; <a href="/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>), though similar expressions occur in Greek poets. "Pity" (or, "compassion") is an attribute of God in <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>: comp. <a href="/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a> ("pitiful") (On kindness, or kindliness, see <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a> - in each case following "long suffering;" <a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>, where it is opposed to "severity" in God (comp. <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>); <a href="/ephesians/2-7.htm">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4</a>, where it is ascribed to God in his dealing with men in Christ; also <a href="/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>.) It is synonymous with "goodness" (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-35.htm">Matthew 12:35</a>, etc.); but "goodness" looks chiefly to benefit intended or conferred, "kindness" to the spirit and manner of bestowal (see Trench's 'Synonym'). The objects of "pity" are the suffering and miserable; of "kindness," the needy and dependent. The "lowliness of mind" of <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18, 23</a> was something specious and to be guarded against; here it is the central and essential element of the true Christian temper (<a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>; <a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>; <a href="/luke/18-14.htm">Luke 18:14</a>), its self-regarding element (<a href="/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>). It is linked with meekness, as in <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a> and <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. "Pity" and "kindness," preceding "humility," relate to the claims of others upon us; "meekness" and "long suffering," to our bearing towards them. "Meekness," the opposite of rudeness and self assertion (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>), is a delicate consideration for the rights and feelings of others, especially necessary in administering rebuke or discipline (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>; <a href="/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>), and conspicuous in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1</a>). St. Peter marks it as a womanly virtue (<a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). "Long suffering" is called forth by the conduct of "the evil and unthankful" (see <a href="/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>, and note). St. Paul claims this quality for himself (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>). Throughout Scripture it is ascribed to God (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9, 15</a>, etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Bowels of mercies (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>See on <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>; see on <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>.
