It will be observed how all such phrases prepare for the full conception of Him as Himself “the Word of God.”<p><span class= "bld">In all wisdom.</span>—The symmetry of the original, “in all wisdom teaching . . . in grace singing,” suggests the connection of the words with those following, not, as in our version, with those going before. The indwelling Word of God is described as manifesting itself, first, in the wisdom of mutual teaching, next, in the grace of hearty thanksgiving.<p><span class= "bld">Teaching and admonishing . . .</span>—Here again we have at once general identity and special distinction between this and the parallel passage in <a href="/context/ephesians/5-19.htm" title="Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;">Ephesians 5:19-20</a>. There, as here, we have the “speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,” “the singing in the hearts to the Lord,” and the spirit of “thankfulness.” But there the whole is described as a consequence of “being filled with the Spirit,” and, as an outburst of that spiritual enthusiasm, of which the spurious excitement of drunkenness is the morbid caricature. Here the thought starts from “the word of Christ in the soul,” realised through the gift of the Spirit by all our faculties; and it divides itself accordingly into the function of teaching, which bears on the mind; “the singing in grace” of thankfulness, which comes from and goes to the heart; and the “doing all in the name of Christ,” which belongs to the outer sphere of action.<p><span class= "bld">Psalms and hymns.</span>—The ascription to those of an office of “teaching and admonition” describes what is their real, though indirect, effect. In the Church, as in the world, he who “makes a people’s songs” really guides their minds as well as their hearts. For good and for evil the hymns of the Christian Church have largely influenced her theology.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-17 We must not only do no hurt to any, but do what good we can to all. Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the word of Christ - The doctrine of Christ.<p>Dwell in you richly in all wisdom - Abundantly, producing the spirit of true wisdom.

The meaning is, that they were to lay up the doctrines of the gospel in their hearts, to meditate upon them; to allow them to be their guide, and to endearor wisely to improve them to the best purpose.<p>Teaching and admonishing ... - See this explained in the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19-20</a>. The only additional thought here is, that their psalms and hymns were to be regarded as a method of "teaching" and "admonishing;" that is, they were to be imbued with truth, and to be such as to elevate the mind, and withdraw it from error and sin. Dr. Johnson once said, that if he were allowed to make the ballads of a nation, he cared not who made the laws. It is true in a more important sense that he who is permitted to make the hymns of a church, need care little who preaches, or who makes the creed. He will more effectually mould the sentiments of a church than they who preach or make creeds and confessions. Hence, it is indispensable, in order to the preservation of the truth, that the sacred songs of a church should be imbued with sound evangelical sentiment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

At the Agap&aelig; or love-feasts, and in their family circles, they were to be so full of the Word of Christ in the heart that the mouth should give it utterance in hymns of instruction, admonition, and praise (compare De 6:7). Tertullian [Apology, 39], records that at the love-feasts, after the water had been furnished for the hands and the lights had been literally, according as any had the power, whether by his remembrance of Scripture, or by his powers of composition, he used to be invited to sing praises to God for the common good. Paul contrasts (as in Eph 5:18, 19) the songs of Christians at their social meetings, with the bacchanalian and licentious songs of heathen feasts. Singing usually formed part of the entertainment at Greek banquets (compare Jas 5:13).<p>with grace&#8212;Greek, "IN grace," the element in which your singing is to be: "the grace" of the indwelling Holy Spirit. This clause expresses the seat and source of true psalmody, whether in private or public, namely, the heart as well as the voice; singing (compare Col 3:15, "peace &#8230; rule in your hearts"), the psalm of love and praise being in the heart before it finds vent by the lips, and even when it is not actually expressed by the voice, as in closet-worship. The Greek order forbids English Version, "with grace in your hearts"; rather, "singing in your hearts."<p>to the Lord&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "to God."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom:</span> one learned man conceives Paul to have written this first clause of the verse as in a parenthesis, joining in the sense what next follows to <span class="ital">be ye thankful</span> in the foregoing verse; another would have the parenthesis to begin from <span class="bld"><a href="/colossians/3-14.htm" title=" And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.">Colossians 3:14</a></span>.

The Alexandrian copy and Arabic version read, "the word of God"; by which may be meant the whole Scripture, all the writings of the Old and New Testament, which are by inspiration of God, were endited by the spirit of Christ, speak and testify of him, and were written for his sake, and on his account, and therefore may be called his word; and are what should be searched into, carefully attended to, diligently read, and frequently meditated upon; and which are able, under a divine blessing, to furnish with all spiritual wisdom, or to make men wise unto salvation: or by the word of Christ may be meant more especially the Gospel, which Christ is the author of as God, the preacher of as man, and the subject matter of as God-man and Mediator: it is the word concerning him, his person and offices; concerning peace and pardon by his blood, justification by his righteousness, and complete salvation through his obedience, sufferings and death. The exhortation to let it <p>dwell in them, supposes that it had entered into them, and had a place in them through the spirit and power of Christ; and that it should have a constant and fixed place there, and not be like a stranger or wayfaring man, that tarries but for a night, or like a sojourner, that continues but for a while; but as an inhabitant that takes up its residence and abode, never more to depart; and intends not only a frequent reading, and hearing of, and meditating upon the word of God but continuance in the doctrines of the Gospel, with a steady faith in them, and a hearty affection for them; for such an inhabitation imports a very exact knowledge of the Gospel, and familiarity with it, and affectionate respect for it; as persons that dwell in a house, they are well known by those of the family, they are familiarly conversed with, and are treated with love and respect by them: and so the word of Christ, when it has a fixed and established abode in a man's heart, he has an inward, spiritual, experimental knowledge of it; he is continually conversant with it; this word of Christ is his delight, and the men of his counsel his guide, his acquaintance, with whom he takes sweet counsel together, and esteems it above the most valuable things in the world, and receives and retains it as the word of God. The manner in which the apostle would have it dwell is <p>richly; that is, largely, plentifully, in an abundant manner, as this word signifies; see <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a> and so the Vulgate Latin version renders it here, "abundantly"; and to the same sense the Arabic version. His meaning is, that not one part of the Scripture only should be regarded and attended to but the whole of it, every truth and doctrine in it, even the whole counsel of God; which as it is to be declared and preached in its utmost compass, so all and every part of it is to be received in the love of it, and to be abode in and by; there is a fulness in the Scriptures, an abundance of truth in the Gospel, a large affluence of it; it is a rich treasure, an invaluable mine of precious truths; all which should have a place to their full extent, in both preacher and hearer: and that <p>in all wisdom; or, "unto all wisdom"; in order to attain to all wisdom; not natural wisdom, which is not the design of the Scriptures, nor of the Gospel of Christ; but spiritual wisdom, or wisdom in spiritual things, in things relating to salvation; and which is, and may be arrived unto through attendance to the word of Christ, reading and hearing of it, meditating on it; and especially when accompanied with the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ, and which is to be desired and prayed for. <p>Teaching and admonishing one another. The Syriac version renders it, "teach and instruct yourselves"; and may regard not only publicly teaching Christ, his Gospel, the truths and doctrines of it, and all his commands and ordinances, for which he qualifies men, and sends them forth in his name; but private teaching, by conference, prayer, and singing the praises of God, according to the measure of the gift of grace bestowed on everyone: and so admonishing may not only respect that branch of the public ministry, which is so called, and intends a putting into the mind, or putting persons in mind both of their privilege and duty; nor only that part of church discipline which lies in the admonition of a delinquent, but private reproofs, warnings, and exhortations; and as by other ways, so, among the rest, <p>in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs; referring very probably to the title of several of David's psalms,  "Maschil", which signifies giving instruction, or causing to understand; these psalms, and the singing of them, being appointed as an ordinance, of God to teach, instruct, admonish, and edify the saints; for the meaning of these three words, and the difference between them; see Gill on <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>. <p>singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord; that is, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; and what is meant by singing of them, see the note on the above place: the manner in which they are to be sung is, "with grace"; meaning either by the assistance of the spirit and grace of God, without which no ordinance can be performed aright, to the glory of God, and to spiritual profit and edification, see <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>, or with grace in the heart in exercise, particularly faith, without which it is impossible to please God, see <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> or with gratitude to God, with thankfulness of heart for his mercies, and under a grateful sense of them; or in such a manner as will minister grace unto the hearers, be both amiable and edifying, see <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a> all these senses may be taken in: that the phrase, "in your hearts"; does not mean mental singing, or what is opposed to singing with the voice; see Gill on <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>. The object here, as there, is "to the Lord"; the Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory, of his person and grace: the Alexandrian copy, and the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, "to God": and indeed God, in the three divine Persons, and in all his perfections and works, is the object of praise, and his glory is the end of singing praise. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</span><p>(l) By psalms he means all godly songs which were written upon various occasions, and by hymns, all such as contain the praise of God, and by spiritual songs, other more special and artful songs which were also in praise of God, but they were made fuller of music.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a> f.

In proportion as the gospel is recognised much or little in a church as the common living source and contents of mutual instruction, quickening, discipline, and edification, its dwelling there is quantitatively various. De Wette explains it, not comprehensively enough, in accordance with what follows: “so that many come forward as teachers, and often.” In another way Hofmann limits it arbitrarily: the letting the word of Christ dwell richly in them is conceived <span class="ital">as an act of gratitude</span>. How easy it would have been for Paul to have indicated this intelligibly! But the <span class="ital">new</span> point which he wishes to urge upon his readers, namely, to let the divinely-powerful <span class="ital">means of Christian life</span> dwell richly in them, is placed by him without any link of connection, and independently, at the head of his closing exhortation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span> is the modal definition of the foregoing; <span class="ital">so that ye</span>, etc.; construction according to the logical subject, as in <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ</span>] Since what precedes has its defining epithet in <span class="greekheb">πλουσίως</span>, and that with all the emphasis of the adverb put at the end, and since, moreover, the symmetry of the following participial clauses, each of which begins with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριτι</span>), ought not to be abandoned without some special reason, the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σοφ</span>. is to be referred <span class="ital">to what follows</span> (so Bos, Bengel, Storr, Flatt, Bähr, Steiger, Olshausen, Huther, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald, Dalmer, Reiche, Bleek, Hofmann, and others; Böhmer hesitates, and Beza <span class="ital">permits</span> this reference), and not to what <span class="ital">precedes</span> (so Syriac, Chrysostom, Luther, and many others).

(de Wette), seeing that the position of <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτούς</span> binds the two participles together, and seeing that inspired songs by no means exclude a <span class="ital">doctrinal</span> purport. The conceivableness of a didactic activity in mutual <span class="ital">singing</span> (in opposition to Schenkel and Hofmann), and that without confounding things radically different, is still clearly enough recognisable in many of our best church songs, especially in those born of the fresh spirit of the Reformation. Storr and Flatt, Schenkel and Hofmann join the words with <span class="greekheb">ᾄδοντες</span>, although the latter has already a definition both before and after it, and although one does not say <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοῖς κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ᾄδειν</span> (<span class="ital">dative</span>), but <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοὺς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

The <span class="ital">dative of the instrument</span> with <span class="greekheb">ᾄδειν</span> <span class="ital">would be appropriate, if it had along with it an accusative of the object praised</span> (<span class="ital">as e.g</span>. Eur. <span class="ital">Ion</span>. 1091). See, moreover, on <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm" title="Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;">Ephesians 5:19</a>. Concerning the distinction between <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοί</span> (religious songs after the manner of the Psalms of the O.

Observe, moreover, that Paul is here also (comp. Eph. <span class="ital">l.c</span>.) speaking not of <span class="ital">divine worship</span>[160] in the proper sense of the term, since the teaching and admonition in question are required from the readers <span class="ital">generally</span> and <span class="ital">mutually</span>, and that as a proof of their <span class="ital">abundant</span> possession of the word of Christ, but rather of the <span class="ital">communication one with another in religious intercourse (e.g</span>. at meals, in the agapae and other meetings, in family circles, etc.)—in which enthusiasm makes the fulness of the heart pass from mouth to mouth, and brotherly instruction and admonition thus find expression in the higher form of psalms, etc., whether these may have been songs already well known, or extemporized according to the peculiar character and productive capacity of the individual enthusiasm, whether they may have been sung by individuals alone (especially if they were improvised), or chorally, or in the form of alternating chants (Plin. <span class="ital">Ep</span>. x. 97). How common religious singing was in the ancient church, even apart from divine service proper, may be seen in Suicer, <span class="ital">Thes</span>. II. p. 1568 f. The existence of a multitude of rhythmic songs, composed <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span> <span class="ital">by Christians, is attested by Eus.</span> <span class="ital">H. E</span>. ii. 17, v. 28.

II. p. 110 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">asyndetic</span> (see the critical remarks) juxtaposition of <span class="greekheb">ψαλμ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ὕμν</span>., and <span class="greekheb">ᾠδαῖς πν</span>. renders the discourse more urgent and animated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ χάριτι ᾄδοντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] is commonly regarded as <span class="ital">subordinate</span> to what goes before; as if Paul would say: <span class="ital">the heart also is to take part in their singing</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἁπλῶς τῷ στόματι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστι μετὰ προσοχῆς</span>, Theophylact. But Paul himself has not in the least expressed any such <span class="ital">contrasting</span> reference; and how superfluous, nay, even inappropriate, would such an injunction be, seeing that the <span class="greekheb">διδάσκειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">νουθετεῖν</span> takes place in fact by the <span class="greekheb">ψαλμοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and this is to be the outcome of the abundant indwelling of the gospel; and seeing, further, that there is no mention at all of a stated common worship (where, possibly, lip-service might intrude), but, on the contrary, of mutual edifying intercourse! The entire view is based upon the unfounded supposition of a degeneracy of worship in the apostolic age, which, even though it were true in itself, would be totally inapplicable here. Moreover, we should expect the idea, that the singing is to be the expression of the emotion of the heart, to be represented not by <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καρδ</span>., but by <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν καρδ</span>. (comp. <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2 Timothy 2:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-34.htm" title="O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.">Matthew 12:34</a>) or <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. Comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-21.htm" title="Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,">Wis 8:21</a>, also classical expressions like <span class="greekheb">ἐκ φρενός</span> and the like. No, the participial clause is <span class="ital">co-ordinate</span> with the preceding one (as also at <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm" title="Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;">Ephesians 5:19</a>, see <span class="ital">in loc</span>.), and conveys—after the audible singing for the purpose of teaching and admonition, to be done <span class="ital">mutually</span>—as a <span class="ital">further</span> element of the pious life in virtue of the rich indwelling of the word of Christ, the <span class="ital">still singing of the heart</span>, which each one must offer to God <span class="ital">for himself inwardly; i.e</span>. the silent praising of God, which belongs to self-edification in the inner man. Chrysostom already indicates this view, but mixes it up, notwithstanding, with the usual one; Theophylact quotes it as <span class="ital">another</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἄλλως</span>), giving to it, moreover, the inappropriate antithesis: <span class="greekheb">μὴ πρὸς ἐπίδειξιν</span>, but adding with Chrysostom the correct illustration: <span class="greekheb">κἂν γὰρ ἐν ἀγορᾷ ᾖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">δύνασαι κατὰ σεαυτὸν ᾄδειν μηδενὸς ἀκούοντος</span>. Bengel well describes the two parallel definitions <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἐν χάριτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as <span class="ital">distributio</span> of the <span class="greekheb">πλουσίως</span>, and that <span class="ital">mutuo</span> et <span class="ital">seorsim</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ χάριτι</span>] does not belong to <span class="greekheb">ᾠδαῖς πνευμ</span>. (Luther: “with spiritual <span class="ital">pleasant</span> songs,” also Calvin), but to <span class="greekheb">ᾄδοντες</span> as the parallel element to <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ</span>. In the same way, namely, as the teaching and admonition above mentioned are to take place <span class="ital">by means of every wisdom</span>, which communicates and operates outwardly through them, so the still singing of the heart now spoken of is to take place <span class="ital">by means of the divine grace</span>, which stirs and moves and impels men’s minds,—a more precise definition, which is so far from being useless and idle (as Hofmann objects), that it, on the contrary, excludes everything that is selfish, vain, fanatical, and the like. Chrysostom says rightly: <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ πνεύματος</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησὶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ᾄδοντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; comp. Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς παρὰ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος δοθείσης χάριτος</span>, also Estius and Steiger. Hofmann’s view is erroneous: that <span class="greekheb">ᾄδειν ἔν τινι</span> means to sing <span class="ital">of something</span>, thus making the grace experienced the <span class="ital">subject-matter</span> of the songs. This it does not mean even in the LXX. <a href="/psalms/138-5.htm" title="Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.">Psalm 138:5</a>, where <span class="greekheb">בִּ</span> is taken in a <span class="ital">local</span> sense.[161] The subject-matter of the singing would have been expressed by an <span class="ital">accusative</span> (as <span class="greekheb">μῆνιν ἄειδε</span>), or with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span>.[162] Inappropriate as to sense (since the discourse concerns singing <span class="ital">in the heart</span>) is the view of others: <span class="ital">with gracefulness</span>. So Theophylact (who, however, permits a choice between this and the true explanation), Erasmus, Luther, Melanchthon (“sine confusione, <span class="greekheb">εὐσχημόνως</span>”), Castalio, Calvin, Beza, Grotius, Calovius, Cornelius a Lapide, Wetstein, Bengel, and others, including Bähr, Baumgarten-Crusius, Schenkel, Reiche. Even though the singing in <span class="ital">public worship</span> were spoken of, the injunction to sing <span class="ital">gracefully</span>, and especially with the emphasis of being placed first, would touch on too singular an element. Anselm, and in more modern times Böhmer, Huther, de Wette, and Bleek take it: with <span class="ital">thankfulness</span>, in which case the article, which Bleek rejects (see the critical remarks), would denote not the gratitude <span class="ital">already required in <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15</a></span> (so Huther), but that which is <span class="ital">due</span>. But the summons to general thanksgiving towards God (in <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15</a>, grateful <span class="ital">conduct</span> was meant by <span class="greekheb">εὐχάρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γίν</span>.) only follows in <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>; and inasmuch as the interpretation which takes it of the <span class="ital">divine grace</span> is highly suitable both to the connection and to the use of the article (which sets forth the <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> as a conception <span class="ital">formally set apart</span>), and places an admirably characteristic element in the foreground, there is no reason for assuming here a call to thanksgiving.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As <span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς καρδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. was contrasted with the preceding <span class="ital">oral</span> singing, so is <span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span> contrasted with the destination for <span class="ital">others;</span> the still heart-singer sings <span class="ital">to God</span>.

The "word of Christ" is the Christian doctrine, <span class="accented">the gospel</span> in the widest sense of the term (<a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>), as proceeding from Christ (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>). This precise phrase occurs <span class="accented">only</span> here, where the name of <span class="accented">Christ</span> is emphasized in so many ways (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>). The apostle, it may be, alludes primarily to the personal teaching of Christ himself (comp. <a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>). "You" is understood collectively by Meyer and others ("amongst you"); but the verb "dwell in" (<a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5, 14</a>) requires the stronger sense, suggested also by the "in your hearts" of ver. 15 (comp. note on "in you," <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). As "the word" is rich in the Divine wealth stored in it (<a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7, 18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="/titus/3-6.htm">Titus 3:6</a>), so it is to dwell "richly" in those who possess it. "In all wisdom" God's grace abounded (<a href="/ephesians/1-8.htm">Ephesians 1:8</a>), and St. Paul himself taught (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>); so with the <span class="accented">richly indwelling word</span> in the minds of the Colossians, especially as they were beset by intellectual forms of error (<a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-4, 8, 23</a>: comp. <a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15</a>). In this connection of thought, the phrase appears to belong to the previous sentence; so English Version and Lightfoot. Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and Ellicott, however, attach it to the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Teaching and admonishing each other</span> [or, <span class="accented">yourselves:</span> comp. ver. 13, note] (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>).

What he is doing in his own ministry and by writing this letter, he bids the Colossians do for each other. "Teaching" precedes, being suggested by "wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">With psalms, hymns, spiritual songs</span> (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>). These are to be a chief means of mutual edification. The repeated "and," also the singular "heart," and "Lord" in place of "God" in the sequel of the verse, are borrowed by the Received Text from <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>. The Greeks, the Asiatic Greeks in particular, were devoted to the arts of music. Song and jest, stimulated by the wine cup, were the entertainment of their social hours (<a href="/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4, 18, 19</a>). Their Christian intercourse is still to be enlivened by the varied use of song, and by the play of wholesome wit (<a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>); but both song and speech are to be "in grace," stamped with a spiritual character and governed by a serious Christian purpose. A "psalm" (from <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">to play</span> an instrument) is "a song set to music;" but this name was already in the LXX appropriated to its present use. Whether its application here is restricted to the psalms of the Old Testament is doubtful (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15, 26</a>). "Hymn" (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) denotes a solemn, religions composition, or song of Divine praise. The word "song" (<span class="accented">ode</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1fa0;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span>) is wider in sense; hence is qualified by "spiritual," equivalent to "with [or, 'in'] the Spirit" (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>) - "songs of a spiritual nature, inspired by the Holy Ghost" (comp. "spiritual wisdom," <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>). Such songs would echo the varied sentiments and experiences of the Christian life. In <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11-13</a>, very possibly, we have fragments of early Christian song. St. Paul's own language, in more exalted moods, tends to assume a rhythmic and lyrical strain (see introductory note on Colossians 1:15-20). <span class="cmt_word">In grace singing, in your hearts, to God</span> (<a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2, 15, 28</a>; <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm">1 John 3:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>). "The correct reading is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (in <span class="accented">the</span> grace);" so Lightfoot, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Herr <span class="accented">in margin</span>, rejected by the Revisers. The tendency to omit the article in prepositional phrases should be taken into account in its favour here. And the article helps the sense by giving "grace" a definite Christian meaning (so "the love," ver. 14). Otherwise, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> may mean no more than "gracefully," "pleasantly;" comp. <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>. "The (Divine) grace" is the pervasive element and subject matter of Christian song. Its constant refrain will be, "to the praise of the glory of his grace!" (<a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6, 12, 14</a>: comp. <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5, 6</a>). "In your hearts" (ver. 15) - the inner region of the soul - there is the counterpart, audible "to God," of the song that vibrates on the lips. In <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a> we read, "with your hearts" - the instrument (here the region) of the song. (For the connection of "in your hearts" and "to God," comp. vers. 22, 23; <a href="/luke/16-15.htm">Luke 16:15</a>; <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>; <a href="/acts/15-8.htm">Acts 15:8</a>; <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-19.htm">1 John 3:19</a>.) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The word of Christ<p>The only occurrence of the phrase.

"Dwell in has its single adverb richly, and is supported and expanded by two coordinate participial clauses, each of which has its spiritual manner or element of action (in all wisdom, in grace) more exactly defined" (Ellicott).<p>Admonishing<p>See on <a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>. The participles teaching and admonishing are used as imperatives, as <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9-13</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16-19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>.<p>One another (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;)<p>Yourselves. See on <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>.<p>Psalms<p>See the parallel passage, <a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>. A psalm was originally a song accompanied by a stringed instrument. See on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>. The idea of accompaniment passed away in usage, and the psalm, in New-Testament phraseology, is an Old-Testament psalm, or a composition having that character. A hymn is a song of praise, and a song (&#x3c9;&#837;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769; ode) is the general term for a song of any kind. Hymns would probably be distinctively Christian. It is supposed by some that Paul embodies fragments of hymns in his epistles, as <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11-14</a>. <a href="//biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>, <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>, are also supposed to be of this character. In both instances of his use of &#x3c9;&#787;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#769; song, Paul adds the term spiritual. The term may, as Trench suggests, denote sacred poems which are neither psalms nor hymns, as Herbert's "Temple," or Keble's "Christian Year." This is the more likely, as the use of these different compositions is not restricted to singing nor to public worship. They are to be used in mutual christian teaching and admonition.<p>With grace (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., the grace. The article limits the meaning to the grace of God. With grace begins the second participial clause. </body></html>
