Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And above all these things - Over, or upon all these things; compare the notes at <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>.<p>Charity - Love.

The idea seems to be that love will bind all the other graces fast together, and render the whole system complete. Without love, though there might be other graces and virtues, there would be a want of harmony and compactness in our Christian graces, and this was necessary to unite and complete the whole. There is great beauty in the expression, and it contains most important truth. If it were possible to conceive that the other graces could exist among a Christian people, yet there would be a sad incompleteness, a painful want of harmony and union, if love were not the reigning principle. Nor faith, nor zeal, nor prophecy, nor the power of speaking with the tongue of angels, would answer the purpose. See this sentiment expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</a>, and the effect of love more fully explained in the notes at that chapter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. above&#8212;rather "over," as in Eph 6:16.

Seeming graces, where love is wanting, are mere hypocrisy. Justification by faith is assumed as already having taken place in those whom Paul addresses, Col 3:12, "elect of God, holy &#8230; beloved," and Col 2:12; so that there is no plea here for Rome's view of justification by works. Love and its works "perfect," that is, manifest the full maturity of faith developed (Mt 5:44, 48). Love &#8230; be ye perfect, &c. (Jas 2:21, 22; 1Jo 2:5). "If we love one another, God's love is perfected in us" (Ro 13:8; 1Co 13:1-13; 1Ti 1:5; 1Jo 4:12). As to "bond," compare Col 2:2, "knit together in love" (Eph 4:3), "keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And above all these things put on charity:</span> that which we render <span class="ital">above, </span> as surpassing all, some read upon, or over, and some, for all these things, viz. the graces he exhorted them to be clothed with.

But in prosecuting the allegory under the former notion, there is some danger of being over fine; and therefore it may be very pertinent to understand the putting on or exercising of charity, for the performance of the other graces and exercises, this being that which sets them on work with reference to their several objects, engaging to sincerity in their actings, without which the motions of the new man are no way acceptable; this links them together, and so is in a sort, as the apostle says elsewhere, a fulfilling of the whole law, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/13-8.htm" title="Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.">Romans 13:8</a>,9 Ga 5:14</span>, with <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/22-39.htm" title="And the second is like to it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Matthew 22:39</a>,40</span>; being the subjects of this hearty and regular affection of love to God and our neighbour, are inclined by it to do good continually, and to avoid the injuring of another in any respect.

Upon supposition that charity in a new creature doth in some sort perfectly fulfil the law, from the time he is endowed with it of God’s grace, and a man hath put it on; he could not by it be justified from the breach of God’s law before, he being a transgressor of it in time past, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1Jo 1:8</a>,10</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

As a prevailing love to God, and to those who bear his image, for his sake, doth bind up the other graces in every regenerate soul, so it doth the true members of the body of Christ one to another, being the best means for the perfecting of them under Christ their Head, who hath upon that account expressly required mutual love amongst his followers, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12</a> <a href="/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1Jo 3:23</a> 4:21</span>: and the cogent reason hereof is, (as above in <span class="bld"><a href="/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10</a>,11</span>), God’s loving of us; and then indeed, when we entirely love God and his children, we show our love to be the bond of perfectness in returning love to him and his; when by this reciprocal affection both ends of the band of love do meet and are knit together, we become one with God, and in him, through Christ, as one soul amongst ourselves, walking in love according to his commandment, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/4-32.htm" title="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.">Acts 4:32</a> <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm" title="And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.">Ephesians 5:2</a> <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm" title="But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/colossians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And above all these things,....

In making <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπην</span> dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἐνδύσασθε</span>, Paul abides by his figure: becoming added (Kühner, II. 1, p. 433) to all those virtues (regarded as garments), love is to be put on like an upper garment embracing all, because love brings it about, that the moral perfection is established in its organic unity as an integral whole. Thus love is the <span class="ital">bond</span> of Christian perfection, its <span class="greekheb">συνδετικὸν ὄργανον</span>; without love, all the individual virtues, which belong in themselves to that perfection, would not unite together into that necessary harmonious entirety, in which perfection consists. Not as if the latter were already <span class="ital">existent without</span> love (as Schenkel objects to this view), but love is the <span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμος</span> <span class="ital">constituting</span> its perfection; <span class="ital">apart from</span>, love <span class="ital">there is</span> no <span class="greekheb">τελειότης</span>, which has its conditio <span class="ital">sine qua non</span> only in the inclusion of its other factors in love; <span class="ital">how</span> love accomplishes this, no one has better shown than Paul himself in 1 Corinthians 13.[154] Nor is it as if the genitive would necessarily be a <span class="ital">plurality</span> (as Hofmann objects); on the contrary, the <span class="greekheb">τελειότης</span> according to its nature and to the context is a <span class="ital">collective</span> idea, with which the conception of a <span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμος</span> well corresponds. It might, moreover, occasion surprise, that <span class="ital">love</span>, which is withal the principle and presupposition of the virtues enumerated, is mentioned <span class="ital">last</span>, and described as <span class="ital">being added;</span> but this was rendered necessary by the <span class="ital">figurative</span> representation, because love, from its nature, in so far as it <span class="ital">includes in principle</span> the collective virtues and <span class="ital">comprehends</span> them in itself, necessarily had assigned to it in the figure of putting on garments the place of the <span class="ital">upper garment</span>, so that Paul rightly proceeds in his description from the under garments to the upper one which holds all the others together, and with whose function love corresponds.

Comp.

Taken as the genitive of <span class="ital">quality</span>, it would yield the <span class="ital">adjective</span> sense: <span class="ital">the perfect bond</span>, “animos sc. conjungens,” Grotius. So also Erasmus, Vatablus, Calovius, Estius, Wolf, Michaelis, Rosenmüller, Flatt, and others. But how arbitrary this would be in itself, and especially in view of the fact that, in the event of <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τελειότ</span>. being disposed of as an adjective, the more precise definition of <span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμος</span> would have to be <span class="ital">gratuitously introduced!</span> Taken as the genitivus <span class="ital">causae</span> (Schenkel), it would not correspond with the <span class="ital">figure</span>, though it is <span class="ital">in substance</span> correct that that, which as a bond envelopes perfection, only thereby brings about its existence (comp. above). According to Huther, the sense is: “by man’s putting on love he is girt with perfection; whosoever lives in love is perfect.” Thus the genitive would have to be conceived as genitive of <span class="ital">apposition</span>, which would yield an incongruous analysis of the figure, induced by the opinion that <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> does not refer to the <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span> itself, but to the <span class="greekheb">ἐνδύσασθαι τὴν ἀγάπην</span>.[155] According to Hofmann (comp. Ellicott), the genitive is meant to be that of the <span class="ital">subject</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">τελειότης</span> is to indicate the completeness of the <span class="ital">Christian state</span>, of which love is the bond, <span class="ital">inasmuch as</span> it binds <span class="ital">Christians together among themselves, wherever that completeness exists</span> (<a href="/john/13-35.htm" title="By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.">John 13:35</a>). This is erroneous; for if in some curious fashion the abstract <span class="greekheb">ἡ τελειότης</span> (consequently an aggregate of attributes) were to be the acting subject, which makes use of love as a bond (consequently for the purpose of binding), yet <span class="ital">the Christians among themselves</span> could not be conceived as the object of that binding, but only the <span class="greekheb">πάντα ταῦτα</span> in accordance with the immediate context (<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πᾶσι δὲ τούτοις</span>). The apostle would have been able to express the tenor of thought forced upon him by Hofmann simply and clearly by some such phrase as <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐστι σύνδεσμος τῶν ἐν Χριστῷ τελείων</span> (comp. <a href="/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>). Others take it as the <span class="ital">sum</span> of perfection. So Bengel, Zachariae, Usteri, Böhmer, Steiger, de Wette, Olshausen (“inasmuch as it comprehends in itself—bears, as it were, bound up in itself—all the individual aspects of the perfect life, all virtues”).

This explanation cannot be justified linguistically (not even by Simplic. <span class="ital">Epictet</span>. p. 208, according to which the Pythagoreans termed friendship: <span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμον πασῶν τῶν ἀρετῶν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. the bond which knits all the virtues together), unless we take <span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμος</span> in the sense of a <span class="ital">bundle</span>, as Herodian uses it, iv. 12. 11 (<span class="greekheb">πάντα τὸν σύνδεσμον τῶν ἐπιστολῶν</span>), which, however, even apart from the singular form of the conception in itself, would be unsuitable to the context, since love is to be <span class="ital">added</span> to all the previously enumerated elements of perfection, and may therefore well be termed the <span class="ital">bond</span> that holds them together, but not their <span class="ital">bundle</span>, not the <span class="ital">sum</span> of them. The word <span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμος</span> itself, which except in our two parallel epistles does not occur in Paul’s writings, is too hastily assigned by Holtzmann “<span class="ital">to the range of language of the Auctor ad Ephesios</span>.” As if we had the whole linguistic range of the copious apostle in the few epistles which bear his name! Indeed, even <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πᾶσι δὲ τούτοις</span> (comp. <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>) is alleged to betray the <span class="ital">auctor</span> in question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In opposition to the Catholic use of our passage to support the <span class="ital">justificatio operum</span>, it is enough to observe that the entire exhortation has justification as its <span class="ital">presupposition</span> (<a href="/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>), and concerns the moral life <span class="ital">of those who are already justified</span>. Irrelevantly, however, it is urged in the <span class="ital">Apol. Conf. Aug</span>. 3, p. 104 f. (comp. Calovius and others), in opposition to the Catholics, that <span class="greekheb">τελειότης</span> is the <span class="ital">integritas ecclesiae</span>, and that through love the church <span class="ital">is kept in harmony</span>, as Erasmus, Melanchthon, and others also explained it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[154] Comp.

Besides, it would not at all be easy to see why Paul should not have used the definite word <span class="greekheb">ζώνη</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμος</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/3-14.htm" title=" And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.">Colossians 3:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πᾶσι δὲ τούτοις τὴν ἀγάπην</span>: probably “over all these,” carrying on the metaphor of clothing, not “in addition to all”. These virtues are manifestations of love, but may be conceivably exhibited where love is absent, so that the mention of it is not superfluous.—<span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστιν</span>: probably “that is,” though for criticism of Lightfoot’s examples see Abbott. The relative cannot mean <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐνδύσασθαι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>., for love itself is the <span class="greekheb">σύνδ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">σύδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος</span>. Generally <span class="greekheb">σύνδ</span>. is explained as that which binds together all the virtues. The genitive is variously interpreted. It has been taken as genitive of the object, but the objection (Luther, Ol., Haupt) that the bond binds the virtues into a unity but does not bind together the unity itself is forcible. It has also been taken as a genitive of quality, “the perfect bond,” which Paul would have said if he had meant it. Ellicott regards it as a subjective genitive, the bond possessed by perfectness; but this seems unlikely. Again, it is explained as the bond which produces perfection in these virtues (Ol.), or as the bond which binds these virtues together and so produces Christian perfection (Sod). If, however, we do not take <span class="greekheb">τελ</span>. as an objective genitive, there is no ground for assuming that the bond is that which binds the virtues together. The function of love as a bond is to bind Christians together, and Haupt explains the word in this way. The genitive he regards as one of apposition, the bond in which perfection consists. When love binds all Christians together, the ideal of Christian perfection is attained. This gives a natural and appropriate sense, and is probably right. The view that <span class="greekheb">σύνδ</span>. is the sum total gives a sense to the word which it does not bear; nor does it suit the context.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">above all these</span> things] Or, “<span class="ital">upon</span> all these things.” Perhaps the words convey both the <span class="ital">supreme importance</span> of love, and its relation to other graces as their <span class="ital">embracing bond;</span> see just below. “Love is the outer garment” (rather, the girdle?) “which holds the others in their places” (Lightfoot).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>put on] The words are supplied from <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">charity</span>] Or, <span class="bld">love</span>.
