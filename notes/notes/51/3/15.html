The ordinary reading is, no doubt, borrowed from <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm" title="And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.">Philippians 4:7</a>. This verse forms a link between the preceding exhortation to love of man, and the following exhortation to a loving and thankful service of God. The “peace of Christ” is the sense of unity in Him, with our fellow-men and with God. We are “called to it in one Body,” of which He is the Head. (Comp. the fuller treatment of this subject in <a href="/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14-22</a>; where, in accordance with the whole character of that Epistle, the unity “in one Body,” here only alluded to, is worked out in vividness and detail.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-17 We must not only do no hurt to any, but do what good we can to all. Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And let the peace of God - The peace which God gives; Notes, <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>.<p>Rule in your hearts - Preside in your hearts; sit as umpire there (Doddridge); govern and control you. The word rendered here "rule" -  &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;  brabeueto&#772; - is commonly used in reference to the Olympic and other games. It means, to be a director, or arbiter of the public games; to preside over them and preserve order, and to distribute the prizes to the victors. The meaning here is, that the peace which God gives to the soul is to be to us what the brabeutes, or governor at the games was to those who contended there. It is to preside over and govern the mind; to preserve every thing in its place; and to save it from tumult, disorder, and irregularity. The thought is a very beautiful one. The soul is liable to the agitations of passion and excitement - like an assembled multitude of men. It needs something to preside over it, and keep its various faculties in place and order; and nothing is so well fitted to do this as the calm peace which religion gives, a deep sense of the presence of God, the desire and the evidence of his friendship, the hope of his favor, and the belief that he has forgiven all our sins. The "peace of God" will thus calm down every agitated element of the soul; subdue the tumult of passion, and preserve the mind in healthful action and order - as a ruler sways and controls the passions of assembled multitudes of people.<p>To the which ye are also called - To which peace.<p>In one body - To be one body; or to be united as one; notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>.<p>And be ye thankful - For all mercies, and especially for your privileges and hopes as Christians. A spirit of thankfulness, also, would tend much to promote harmony and peace. An ungrateful people is commonly a tumultuous, agitated, restless, and dissatisfied people. Nothing better tends to promote peace and order than gratitude to God for his mercies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. peace of God&#8212;The oldest manuscripts and versions read, "The peace of Christ" (compare Php 4:7). "The peace of God." Therefore Christ is God. Peace was His legacy to His disciples before He left them (Joh 14:27), "My peace I give unto you." Peace is peculiarly His to give. Peace follows love (Col 3:14; Eph 4:2, 3).<p>rule&#8212;literally, "sit as umpire"; the same Greek verb simple, as appears compounded (Col 2:18). The false teacher, as a self-constituted umpire, defrauds you of your prize; but if the peace of Christ be your umpire ruling in your hearts, your reward is sure. "Let the peace of Christ act as umpire when anger, envy, and such passions arise; and restrain them." Let not those passions give the award, so that you should be swayed by them, but let Christ's peace be the decider of everything.<p>in your hearts&#8212;Many wear a peaceful countenance and speak peace with the mouth, while war is in their hearts (Ps 28:3; 55:21).<p>to the which&#8212;that is, with a view to which state of Christian peace (Isa 26:3); 1Co 7:15, "God hath called us to peace."<p>ye are called&#8212;Greek, "ye were also called." The "also" implies that besides Paul's exhortation, they have also as a motive to "peace," their having been once for all called.<p>in one body&#8212;(Eph 4:4). The unity of the body is a strong argument for "peace" among the members.<p>be ye thankful&#8212;for your "calling." Not to have "peace ruling in your hearts" would be inconsistent with the "calling in one body," and would be practical unthankfulness to God who called us (Eph 5:4, 19, 20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And let the peace of God; </span> he doth not say the peace of the world, but <span class="ital">the peace of God, </span> or, as some copies, the peace of Christ; be sure, without the mediation of Christ we can have no peace with God; he alone hath <span class="ital">made peace, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a></span>, with <span class="bld"><a href="/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a></span>; he is <span class="ital">our peace, </span> making it with God and amongst ourselves, to whom he hath preached it, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/10-36.htm" title="The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)">Acts 10:36</a> <a href="/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;...">Ephesians 2:14-17</a></span>, and whom he hath brought into the bond of it, <span class="bld"><a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm" title="Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.">Ephesians 4:3</a></span>; <span class="ital">the Lord of peace</span> himself, who always gives it where it is enjoyed, <span class="bld"><a href="/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you.

So the import of the apostle’s injunction is, let it regulate, govern, superintend, or give law to the rest of the affections of the new man; let it be mistress and governess of all your motions, to keep them in due respect, and withhold them from attempting any thing disorderly, and to oversway disinclinations to the Divine pleasure or the good order of Christian community.

By "the peace of God" is meant, either the peace believers have with God, which is his gift, and passes all understanding, and flows from a comfortable apprehension of interest in the blood, righteousness, and atonement of Christ; or rather that peace which does, or should subsist among the saints themselves, which God is the author of, calls for, and requires, and encourages in them. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and, Ethiopic versions, read, "the peace of Christ"; and so the Alexandrian copy, and some others. This may be said to "reign" in their hearts, when it is the governing principle there; when it restrains the turbulent passions of anger, wrath, and revenge, allays undue heats, moderates the spirits, and composes differences. The metaphor is taken from the judge in the Olympic games, who was the umpire, the moderator, and who determined whose the victory was, and to whom the crown belonged; the apostle would have no other umpire among the saints than the peace of God: and the arguments he uses follow, <p>to the which also you are called in one body; the saints in their effectual calling are called to peace by God, who is the God of peace; by Christ, who is the Prince of peace; and by the Spirit, whose fruit is peace; and through the Gospel, which is the Gospel of peace, and into a Gospel state, which lies in peace, righteousness, and joy in the Holy Ghost: and they are not only called to this, but they are called "in one body"; though they are many members, yet they are but one body; and therefore ought to be in peace, and that should bear the sway in them, seeing it is unnatural for members of the same body to quarrel with each other. <p>And be ye thankful; which intends either gratitude to men, to fellow creatures, for any service or kindness done by them, especially to the saints, the members of the same body, who are placed in a subservience, and in order to be useful to each other; or else to God, for all spiritual blessings in Christ, and particularly the peace he gives, for the effectual calling, and a place in the body, the church; and "to Christ", as the Syriac version reads, for all those graces which come from him, and strength to exercise them, and for himself, and an interest in him, who is all in all; and a grateful spirit, both for spiritual and temporal mercies, is a very becoming and beautiful one, and is another part of the ornament of a Christian: this last is added to make way for what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And let the peace of God <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> one body; and be ye thankful.</span><p>(i) Rule and govern all things.<p>(k) You are joined together into one body through God's goodness, so that you might help one another, as fellow members.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15</a>.

To understand the peace of mutual <span class="ital">concord</span> (the Greek Fathers, Erasmus, Calvin, Grotius, Calovius, and many others, also Reiche, <span class="ital">Comm.

Moreover, there is implied in <span class="greekheb">βραβ</span>. the determining and regulating power, the <span class="ital">supreme authority</span>, which the peace of Christ is to have in the Christian heart, which suits most fully the above interpretation alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">βραβευέτω</span>] <span class="greekheb">βραβεύειν</span> only found here in the N.

So Luther (“let it be master and keep you in all tribulation”), Castalio, Beza, Bengel, and many others, including Flatt, Bähr, Olshausen, Steiger, Huther, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Dalmer, and Bleek. The conception involves the <span class="ital">superintending</span>, arranging, and administering activity, and that in <span class="ital">supreme deciding</span> competence (comp.

"The peace of Christ" is that which he effects in reconciling men to God, and to himself as their Lord (ver. 13 <span class="accented">b</span>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, see note; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).

In <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, on the other hand, <span class="accented">Christ's peace</span>, his "legacy," is that which he possessed and exemplified - an idea foreign to this context. This "peace" is to "act as umpire" in the Christian's heart. The compound <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>-<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> ("act as umpire against you") has already been used in <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a> (see note; also <a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>, cognate <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of the false teacher who, in condemning the faith of the Colossian Christians as insufficient for the attaining of "perfectness" (ver. 14) without angel worship, etc., virtually <span class="accented">took away their prize</span> and judged them "unworthy of eternal life." The Greek commentators seem, therefore, to be right, as against most moderns (but see Klopper on the other side), in retaining the primary sense of the verb instead of generalizing it into "rule" or the like. It stands in precise antithesis, both of sense and sound, to <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>: "Let not the deceivers decide against you, but let the peace of Christ decide in your hearts" (Cramer's 'Catena'). "The peace of Christ" dwelling within the heart is to be the security of the Colossian believer against the threats of false teachers: "They seek to rob you of your prize; let this assure you of it." Present, conscious peace with God is a warrant of the Christian's hope of everlasting life (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31-39</a>; <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>). This assurance is identical with "the witness of the Spirit" (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15, 16</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). The apostle argued in <a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 5</a> from the present faith and love of his readers to "the hope laid up for them in heaven;" here he bids them find in the peace which Christ has brought to their souls the earnest of their future bliss. It is but a generalizing of the same idea when he speaks in <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a> of "the peace of God" as "garrisoning the heart and thoughts" against fear and doubt. <span class="cmt_word">Unto which also ye were called, in one body</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 18</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-18, 1-6</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-17.htm">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a>; <a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>). So this "peace" is to be at once their inward safeguard, and the ground of their outward union. They are to stand together in its defence (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>). Error, which blights the Church's <span class="accented">hope</span>, destroys her unity. So the maintenance of that "one hope of our calling," assured by a Divine peace within the soul, unites all Christian hearts in a common cause (compare the connection of vers. 18 and 19 in <a href="/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>.). With St. Paul, the peace of God's children with him and with each other is so essentially one that he speaks almost indistinguishably of both (<a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He adds, and be ye thankful</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5, 12</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>); viz. "for this assurance of your future blessedness afforded by the peace of Christ within your hearts, with its outward evidence in your Christian unity." The apostle gave thanks for them on like grounds (<a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5</a>: comp. 1:12-14). The command <span class="accented">to give thanks</span> prevails in this Epistle, as that <span class="accented">to rejoice</span> in Philippians. "Be" is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("become"); so in <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1, 17</a>.

Only here in the New Testament. See on <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>. The previous references to occasions for meekness, long-suffering, forbearance, forgiveness, etc., indicate a conflict of passions and motives in the heart. Christ is the one who adjusts all these, so that the metaphorical sense is appropriate, as in <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>.<p>Called in one body<p>See <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>. So that ye are in one body according to your call. </body></html>
