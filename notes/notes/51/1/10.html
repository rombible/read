to walk worthy of Him is to have His life reproduced in us, to follow His example, to have “the mind of Christ Jesus.” The “worthiness” is, of course, relative to our capacity, not absolute.<p><span class= "bld">All pleasing.</span>—The word here used is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is employed in classic and Hellenistic Greek to mean “a general disposition to please”—a constant preference of the will of others before our own. It is here used with tacit reference to God, since towards Him alone can it be a safe guide of action. Otherwise it must have the bad sense which in general usage was attached to it. St. Paul emphatically disowns and condemns the temper of “men-pleasing” (see <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-6.htm" title="Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1Thessalonians 2:4</a>), as incompatible with being “the servant of Christ.” He could, indeed, “be all things to all men” (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm" title="To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.">1Corinthians 9:22</a>); he could bid each man “please his neighbour for his edification” (<a href="/romans/15-12.htm" title="And again, Esaias said, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.">Romans 15:12</a>). But the only “pleasing” to which the whole life can be conformed is (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>) the consideration “how we ought to walk and to please God.” Only in subordination to this can we safely act on the desire of “all pleasing” towards men.<p><span class= "bld">Increasing in </span>(<span class= "ital">or, by</span>) <span class= "bld">the knowledge of God.</span>—The context evidently shows that the path towards the knowledge of God here indicated is not the path of thoughtful speculation, or of meditative devotion, but the third path co-ordinate with these—the path of earnest practice, of which the watchword is, “Do and thou shalt know.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord - That you may live as becomes the followers of the Lord. How this was to be done he states in this and the following verses.<p>Unto all pleasing - So as to please him in all things; compare <a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a>.<p>Being fruitful in every good work - This is one way in which we are to walk worthy of the Lord, and so as to please him; see the notes at <a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>.<p>And increasing in the knowledge of God - This is another way in which we may walk worthy of the Lord, and so as to please him. It is by endeavoring to become better acquainted with his true character. God is pleased with those who desire to understand what he is; what he does; what he purposes; what he commands. Hence he not only commands us to study his works (compare <a href="/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a>), but he has made a world so beautiful as to invite us to contemplate his perfections as reflected in that world. All good beings desire that others should understand their character, and God delights in those who are sincerely desirous of knowing what he is, and who inquire with humility and reverence into his counsels and his will. People are often displeased when others attempt to look into their plans, for they are sensible they will not bear the light of investigation. God has no plans which would not be seen to be, in the highest degree, glorious to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

This is the first manifestation of their "walking worthy of the Lord." The second is, "increasing (growing) in the knowledge of God (or as the oldest manuscripts read, 'growing BY the full knowledge of God')"; thus, as the Gospel word (Col 1:6) was said to "bring forth fruit," and to "grow" in all the world, even as it did in the Colossians, ever since the day they knew the grace of God, so here it is Paul's prayer that they might continue to "bring forth fruit," and "grow" more and more by the full knowledge of God, the more that "knowledge" (Col 1:9) was imparted to them. The full knowledge of God is the real instrument of enlargement in soul and life of the believer [Alford]. The third manifestation of their walk is (Col 1:11), "Being strengthened with all might," &c. The fourth is (Col 1:12), "Giving thanks unto the Father," &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That ye might walk worthy of the Lord:</span> they prayed for the above mentioned gracious habits, that the Colossians might exercise them in a course of life as it becomes those who are effectually called by the gospel to be the sons of God, and the servants of Christ; suitable to the members of the body of Christ: <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Philippians 1:27</a>"</span>; compared with <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/16-2.htm" title="That you receive her in the Lord, as becomes saints, and that you assist her in whatever business she has need of you: for she has been a succorer of many, and of myself also.">Romans 16:2</a> <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a> <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm" title="Why also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a></span>.

The Vulgate Latin version reads, "of God"; to which the Ethiopic version agrees; but rather the Lord Jesus Christ seems to be designed: and to "walk worthy" of him, is to walk by faith in him; to walk after his Spirit, and according to his word, and in his ordinances; to have the conversation as becomes his Gospel, and worthy of that calling wherewith the saints are called by grace to the obtaining of his kingdom and glory. The apostle prays that their knowledge might issue in practice; for knowledge, without practice, is of no avail: he first asks for knowledge, and then practice, for how should men act according to the will of God, or Christ, unless they know it? and when they know it, they should not rest in their knowledge, but put it in practice: <p>unto all pleasing. The Syriac reads it, "that ye may please God in all good works": an unregenerate man cannot please God in anything; without faith in Christ it is impossible to please him by anything man can do; Christ only could, and did always the things that pleased his Father; there are many things done by believers which are displeasing to God; nor is there anything they can do that is pleasing to God but through Christ, in whom their persons and, services are accepted; good works being done in faith, and from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God, are acceptable unto him through Christ; and therefore are to be carefully maintained, and studiously performed by all those that have a spiritual understanding of the will of God, and believe in Christ their Lord and Redeemer: <p>being fruitful in every good work; saints are trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord; good works are the fruit, which, under the influence of divine grace, they bring forth; and this is not of one sort only, as trees usually do, but of every kind; being ingrafted into Christ the true vine, and deriving life, sap, and nourishment from him, they are filled with the fruits of righteousness by him, which they bring forth and bear, to the glory of his heavenly Father; and being such, they are pleasant plants to him, as fruit bearing trees are to the owner of them: wherefore, in order to the saints walking in their lives and conversations unto all pleasing, or pleasing in all things, the apostle prays they might be fruitful in good works, and that in everyone, in every kind of good works: <p>and increasing in the knowledge of God; not barely of his nature and perfections, as they are displayed in the works of creation; but of his mind, and will, and the mysteries of his grace, as they are revealed in the Gospel; of the knowledge of him in Christ, as the God of all grace, and as a covenant God and Father. The apostle had before prayed for an increase of the knowledge of the will of God, previous to his request, for the putting of it in practice; and now suggests, that an increase of the knowledge of God himself may be expected in a practical use of means, an attendance on the ordinances of Christ, and a diligent performance of good works: from the whole of these petitions, it may be observed by the apostle's asking for them, that all our knowledge, and the increase of it, and all our fruitfulness in good works, are all from the Lord; and therefore we have no reason to boast of our knowledge, nor depend upon our works, but frankly to own, that notwithstanding all we know, and do, we are but unprofitable servants. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/1-10.htm" title=" That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;">Colossians 1:10</a>.

The fact that here <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> generally is said, and not <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θελήματος Θεοῦ</span> repeated, is in keeping with the progressive development set forth; there is something of a <span class="ital">climax</span> in it.

This lofty wisdom and insight is not an end in itself. It must issue in right practice. Doctrine and ethics are for Paul inseparable. Right conduct must be founded on right thinking, but right thinking must also lead to right conduct. The infinitive expresses result “so as to walk”. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Κυρ</span>., <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, of Christ, not of God (Hofm., Ol.). In <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a> <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> is used, but <span class="greekheb">ὁ Κύρ</span>. in Paul means Christ.—<span class="greekheb">ἀρεσκείαν</span> in classical Greek used generally in a bad sense, of obsequiousness. But it often occurs in Philo in a good sense; see the note on the word in Deissmann’s <span class="ital">Bible Studies</span>, p. 224. <span class="greekheb">καρποφοροῦντες καὶ αὐξανόμενοι</span>. For the collocation <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>. The participles should probably be connected with <span class="greekheb">περιπατῆσαι</span>, not (as by Beng., Hofm., Weiss) with <span class="greekheb">πληρωθῆτε</span>, which is too far away. The continuation of an infinitive by a nominative participle instead of the accusative is frequent in classical Greek, and occurs several times in Paul (<a href="/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>, <a href="/context/ephesians/4-2.htm" title="With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;...">Ephesians 4:2-3</a>). They should not be separated. The whole clause should be translated “bearing fruit and increasing in every good work by the knowledge of God”. Fruit bearing is one of Paul’s favourite metaphors.—<span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐπιγνώσει</span>: not as R.V. and Moule “in the knowledge,” for Paul has already spoken of this in <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>, but “by the knowledge,” the knowledge of God being the means of their spiritual growth. Meyer, against the overwhelming weight of evidence, reads <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν</span>, “as regards the knowledge”. This would make knowledge the goal of conduct (<span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>), whereas previously the relation is reversed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">walk</span>] A very frequent word in St Paul; most frequent in Eph., where see <a href="/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a> for a close parallel. See <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a> for one still closer verbally. The word denotes life in its action and intercourse.—The spiritual knowledge which he asks for them is thus sought for the most sacredly practical of purposes—in order to their closer conformity to the will of God <span class="ital">in real life</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">worthy of the Lord</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">worthily</span> &c.; so R.V. But all previous English versions read as A.V., perhaps using the adjective adverbially.—Ideally, of course, no human “walk” is “worthy of the Lord.” But practically it can and should be so, in the sense of being governed at every step by the Divine motive of His love and presence, and so presenting a true correspondence to that motive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">The Lord:</span>”—“St Paul’s common, and apparently universal, usage requires us to understand [‘the Lord’] of Christ.” (Lightfoot). The “worthy <span class="ital">of God</span>” of <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm" title="That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a> thus gives to the phrase here a deep significance in relation to the Godhead of Christ. Such alternative expressions indicate how truly for St Paul the Father and the Son are Persons of the same Order of being. Cp. for similar indications (among very many passages) <a href="/romans/8-35.htm" title="Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?">Romans 8:35</a> with 39; <a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a> with <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto all pleasing</span>] “So as to aim at, and go the length of, <span class="ital">meeting every wish</span> (of the Lord’s).”—The word rendered “pleasing” is most instructive. In classical Greek it denotes a cringing and subservient habit, ready to do or say anything to please a patron; not only to meet but to anticipate his most trivial wishes. But when transferred to the spiritual region, and the believer’s relations to his Lord, the word at once rises by its association. <span class="ital">To do anything</span> to meet, to anticipate, His wishes, is not only the most beneficial but the most absolutely right thing we can do. It is His eternal and sacred due; it is at the same time the surest path to our own highest development and gain.—See Lightfoot’s excellent note.—For a close parallel to the wording here, see <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>, where the cognate verb is used.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fruitful</span>] See above on <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>.

But the text R.V. renders as A.V., though using this other and better-attested Greek, which gives <span class="ital">epignósis</span> in the dative, without preposition. This is quite good grammatically; cp. <span class="ital">e.g.</span> the Greek of <a href="/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Php 2:8</a>. The dative is used as the case of reference; the growth is growth <span class="ital">with regard to</span> spiritual knowledge of God; that is, it is a development of that knowledge in the believer, a growth in it.—The other (and we think inferior) rendering meanwhile conveys an undoubted and important truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">The knowledge of God:</span>”—which “is life eternal” (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>). “You must needs know that to enjoy God and His Christ is eternal Life; and the soul’s enjoying is in knowing” (Baxter, <span class="ital">Saint’s Everlasting Rest</span>, Part i. sect. vii.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/1-10.htm" title=" That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;">Colossians 1:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περιπατῆσαι</span>) <span class="ital">that ye may walk</span>.
