But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom we preach, warning every man - This does not mean warning of danger, but "admonishing all of the claims of the gospel to attention." Our word warn is commonly used in the sense of cautioning against danger. The Greek word here means to put in mind; to admonish; to exhort. The idea of the apostle is, that he made it his great business to bring the offers of the gospel fairly before the mind of every man. As it had the same claims on all; as it might be freely offered to all, and as it furnished the only hope of glory, he made it the object of his life to apprize every man of it, as far as he could.<p>And teaching every man - Paul made it his business to instruct men, as well as to exhort them. Exhortation and warning are of little use where there is not sound instruction and a careful inculcation of the truth. It is one of the duties of the ministry to instruct men in those truths of which they were before ignorant; see <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>.<p>In all wisdom - Compare the <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a> note; <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a> note.

Paul was anxious that no one to whom this gospel was preached should be lost.

But the reference seems to be simply to Paul, not to Timothy and Epaphras as well. For throughout the section he is speaking of his own special mission.—<span class="greekheb">νουθετοῦντες</span>. Meyer points out that admonishing and teaching correspond to the two main elements of the evangelic preaching, repent and believe. Haupt thinks on the ground of the order that Paul is not referring to elementary Christian teaching, but has this epistle in his mind. The order might, however, suggest warning to non-Christians followed by teaching of new converts. But the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἐν π</span>. <span class="greekheb">σοφίᾳ</span> and <span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span> support the view that it is warning against error, and advanced teaching that he has in view.—<span class="greekheb">πάντα ἄνθρωπον</span>: emphatically repeated here. The Gospel is for all men, in opposition to any exclusiveness, and for each individual man in particular. And the ideal is only attained when each individual has reached completeness. The exclusiveness might be, as with the Judaisers, of a sectarian type, or, as with the Gnostics, and possibly here, of an intellectual, aristocratic type. Since such is the Apostle’s task, he addresses a Church the members of which are unknown to him.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ</span> is taken by some to express the content of the teaching, everyone may be fully instructed in the whole of Christian wisdom. This forms a good contrast to the probable practice of the false teachers of reserving their higher teaching for an inner circle. But for this we should have expected the accusative. Probably the words express the manner of teaching. If the phrase is taken with both participles the content of the teaching is excluded.—<span class="greekheb">παραστής</span>.: probably to present at the judgment.—<span class="greekheb">τέλειον</span>. Here also allusion to the mysteries is discovered by Lightfoot. The term is said to have been employed to distinguish the fully initiated from novices. But, even if this be correct, the word is used in <a href="/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.">Matthew 19:21</a>, where such a reference is out of the question. Probably Paul is contrasting the completeness he strives to secure with that promised by the false teachers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">we</span>] Emphatic.

It is better to explain this phrase thus than as meaning that “we” teach with perfect wisdom. This would less fully bring out the emphasis (so strong in the Greek) of “<span class="ital">every</span>” “<span class="ital">all</span>,” in this verse. The point is that <span class="ital">every</span> disciple may and should learn <span class="ital">every</span> secret of grace.

See for another side of the same prospect, <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">perfect</span>] <span class="ital">Teleion</span>. In this word Lightfoot sees a technical term of the pagan “mysteries,” borrowed and adapted for the Gospel. In the mysteries, the <span class="ital">teleios</span>, or “perfect,” was the man who had passed his novitiate and was fully instructed. The term was certainly used by the Gnostics of the sub-apostolic age to denote the man who had passed from mere “<span class="ital">faith</span>” (so called) into “<span class="ital">knowledge</span>” (so called). See Lightfoot’s full and instructive note, in which he further remarks that the word “<span class="ital">perfect</span>” is early used in Christian literature to distinguish the baptized man from the catechumen. But we doubt whether the word here can with any certainty be viewed as quasi-technical, or however whether such can be its <span class="ital">main</span> bearing. It appears in e.g. <a href="/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a>, with the apparent meaning of spiritual entirety, whole-heartedness, in the life of love; and cp. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-20.htm" title="Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>; where it is “full-grown,” adult, as different from infantine.

Thrice in this verse "every man" is repeated, and "in all wisdom" follows "teaching" with a marked emphasis. The Colossian errorists, as we should presume from the general tenor and affinities of their system, sought to form an inner mystical school or circle of discipleship within the Church, initiated into a wisdom and holiness supposed to be higher than that attainable by ordinary Christian faith (see note on "mystery," ver. 26; also <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3, 8</a>). <span class="accented">An intellectual caste-feeling</span> (see note, <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>) was springing up in the Church. In <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a> the apostle denounces the pride of reason which claims "the things of God" as its own; here he denounces the pride of intellect which refuses the knowledge of them to those who stand on a lower level of mental culture.

"Wisdom" here is not subjective, a quality of the apostle (so Meyer, quoting <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>), but objective, the quality of the truth itself (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 23</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22-25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we may present every man perfect in Christ</span> (ver. 22; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-7.htm">2 Corinthians 13:7-9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>): the aim alike of Christ's redemption (ver. 22) and of the apostle's ministry. "Perfect" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is a word associated with the Greek mysteries (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6, 7</a>; and quotations in Lightfoot), and in common use denoted "full-grown," "grown men," as opposed to" children "(<a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12, 15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:1</a>). The philosophic Judaists affected this term considerably. Philo frequently distinguishes between the "perfect" or "fully initiated" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), who are admitted to the sight of God, and the "advancing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">c</span>omp. <a href="/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>), who are candidates for admission to the Divine mysteries; and he makes Jacob a type of the latter, Israel of the former (see 'On Drunkenness,' &sect; 20; 'On Change of Names,' &sect; 3; 'On Agriculture,' &sect;&sect; 36-38). The apostle makes "perfect" designedly parallel to the "holy and without blemish" of ver. 22, holding out a spiritual ideal very different from that of Alexandrine mystics; and declares that it is to be realized "in Christ" (vers. 2, 4), as in ver. 22 it appeared to be wrought "through Christ" and "for Christ" (comp. ver. 16). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Warning (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., admonishing.

There may be in this word a hint of its use in the ancient mysteries to designate the fully instructed as distinguished from the novices. Peter uses the technical word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; eye-witnesses, which designated one admitted to the highest grade in the Eleusinian mysteries, of those who beheld Christ's glory in His transfiguration, <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>. From this point of view Bishop Lightfoot appropriately says: "The language of the heathen mysteries is transferred by Paul to the christian dispensation, that he may the more effectively contrast the things signified. The true Gospel also has its mysteries, its hierophants, its initiation; but these are open to all alike. In Christ every believer is &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; fully initiated, for he has been admitted as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; eye-witness of its most profound, most awful secrets." </body></html>
