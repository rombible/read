that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>).<p>(4) His MEDIATION, reconciling all to God, first generally stated, then applied especially to the Colossians (<a href="/context/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19-23</a>).]<p>(13-23) In this we have the great characteristic section of this Epistle, distinguished from corresponding parts of the Epistle to the Ephesians by the explicit and emphatic stress laid upon the divine majesty of Christ. It corresponds very closely with the remarkable passage opening the Epistle to the Hebrews. In the Epistles of the preceding group, to the Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans, chief and almost exclusive prominence is given to the universal mediation of Christ, as justifying and sanctifying all the souls of men. In these Epistles (this truth being accepted) we pass on to that which such universal mediation necessitates—the conception of Christ as the Head of all created being, and as the perfect manifestation of the Godhead. The former is the key-note of the Ephesian Epistle; the latter is dominant here, although the former remains as an undertone; as also in the great passage of the Epistle to the Philippians (<a href="/context/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6-11</a>), speaking of Him as “in the form of God,” and having “the Name which is above every name.” The especial reason for St. Paul’s emphatic assertion of the great truth here we see in the next chapter. But it is clear that it comes naturally in the order of revelation, leading up to the full doctrine of, “the Word” in St. John. As the spiritual meaning of the Resurrection, the great subject of the first preaching, had to be sought in the Atonement, so the inquiry into the possibility of an universal Atonement led back to the Incarnation, and to Christ as pre-existent from “the beginning” in God.<p>(13, 14) We enter on this great passage, as is natural, and accordant with St. Paul’s universal practice, through that living and practical truth of our redemption in Christ Jesus, which in the earlier Epistles he had taught as the one thing needful (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.">1Corinthians 2:2</a>).<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Who hath delivered us from the power of</span> <span class= "bld">darkness.</span>—“Delivered” is “rescued,” properly applied to dragging a person out of battle or the jaws of danger. “The power of darkness” (see <a href="/luke/22-53.htm" title="When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.">Luke 22:53</a>) is, of course, the power of evil, permitted (see <a href="/luke/4-6.htm" title="And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.">Luke 4:6</a>) to exist, but in itself a usurped tyranny (as Chrysostom expresses it), not a true “kingdom. Salvation is, first of all, rescue from the guilt and bondage of sin, to which man has given occasion by his own choice, but which, once admitted, he cannot himself break. It is here described in its first origination from the love of the Father. “God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son.”<p><span class= "bld">And hath translated us . . .</span>—The word “translated” is a word properly applied to the transplanting of races, and the settlement of them in a new home. Salvation, begun by rescue, is completed by the settlement of the rescued captives in the new kingdom of Christ. The two acts, indeed, are distinct, but inseparable. Thus baptism is at once “for the remission of sins” and an “entrance into the kingdom of God.”<p><span class= "bld">His dear Son.</span>—The original is far more striking and beautiful. It is, “The Son of His love,” corresponding to “the beloved” of the parallel passage in the Ephesian Epistle (<a href="/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>), but perhaps going beyond it. God is love; the Son of God is, therefore, the “Son of His love,” partaking of and manifesting this His essential attribute.<p><span class= "bld">In whom we have . . .</span>—This verse corresponds verbally with <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>, where see Note. From the love of the Father, the first cause of salvation, we pass to the efficient cause in the redemption and propitiation of the Son.<p><a href="/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-17</a> pass from Christ as our Mediator to Christ as He is in Himself from all eternity, “the image of the invisible God,” and as He is from the beginning of time, the creator and sustainer of all things in heaven and earth. What was before implied is now explicitly asserted; what was before emphatic ally asserted is now taken for granted, and made the stepping-stone to yet higher and more mysterious truth.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness - The power exerted over us in that dark kingdom to which we formerly belonged - the kingdom of Satan. The characteristic of this empire is darkness - the emblem of:<p>(1) sin;<p>(2) error;<p>(3) misery and death.<p>Over us, by nature, these things had uncontrollable power; but now we are delivered from them, and brought to the enjoyment of the privileges of those who are connected with the kingdom of light. Darkness is often used to represent the state in which men are by nature; compare <a href="/luke/1-79.htm">Luke 1:79</a>; <a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a>.<p>And hath translated us - The word rendered here "translated" is often used in the sense of removing a people from one country to another; see Josephus, Ant. ix. 11. 1. It means, here, that they who are Christians have been transferred from one kingdom to another, as if a people were thus removed. They become subjects of a new kingdom, are under different laws, and belong to a different community. This change is made in regeneration, by which we pass from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light; from the empire of sin, ignorance, and misery, to one of holiness, knowledge, and happiness. No change, therefore, in a man's life is so important as this; and no words can suitably express the gratitude which they should feel who are thus transferred from the empire of darkness to that of light. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. from&#8212;Greek, "out of the power," out of the sphere in which his power is exercised.<p>darkness&#8212;blindness, hatred, misery [Bengel].<p>translated&#8212;Those thus translated as to state, are also transformed as to character.

That is, from the power of Satan; see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>, who, though once an angel of light, is now darkness itself, and is reserved in chains of darkness; he is a ruler of the darkness of this world; his kingdom is a kingdom of darkness; and he blinds the minds of them that believe not, keeps them in darkness, and increases the natural darkness of their minds; he delights in works of darkness, and tempts men to them; and his everlasting state and portion will be blackness of darkness: his power over men, in a state of unregeneracy, which he usurps, and is suffered to exercise, is very great; he works effectually in them, and leads them captive at his will; and nothing less than the power of God, who is stronger than the strong man armed, can deliver out of his hands; and which is at least one part of the mercy for which thanks are here given; See Gill on <a href="/luke/22-53.htm">Luke 22:53</a>; with the Jews, one of the names of Satan is  "darkness" (e). Moreover, the darkness of sin, ignorance, and unbelief, with which God's elect, while in a state of nature, are surrounded, and, as it were shut up and imprisoned, so that they have not the least spark of true spiritual light and knowledge, may be also meant; under the power of which they are to such a degree, that they know nothing of God in Christ, of the way of salvation by him, or of the work of the Spirit on their souls, or of the doctrines of the Gospel in an experimental manner; and so they continue, till, by an almighty power, they are turned from darkness to light; when, by powerful grace, they are plucked as brands out of the burning, and delivered from wrath to come, and from that utter darkness of misery and destruction their ways of sin and darkness led and exposed them to. This deliverance is wrought out for them in the effectual calling, when they are internally called, and powerfully brought out of this darkness, by introducing light into them, revealing Christ in them, causing the prince of darkness to flee from them, and the scales of darkness and blindness to fall from their eyes; and which is both an instance or the wonderful grace of God, and of his almighty power, and in which lies in part the saints' meetness for the inheritance; for these words are, in some sort, explanative of the former; for so long as a person is under the power of darkness, he cannot be meet for an inheritance which is in light: it follows, as another branch of this mercy, for which thanks are given, <p>and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; not into the kingdom of glory; for though the saints are heirs of it, and rejoice in hope of it, they have not yet an entrance into it; which they will have abundantly when Christ shall introduce them into it, not only as his Father's, but as his own kingdom and glory: but the kingdom of grace is here meant, or that state of grace, light, and life, which such are brought into, when rescued out of Satan's hands, and recovered out of their former state of ignorance and infidelity; when they are by the drawings of the Father, by his powerful and efficacious grace, brought to Christ, and, in the day his power on their souls, are made willing to submit to his righteousness, and to embrace him as the alone Saviour and Redeemer, and be subject to him as King of saints, observing his commands, keeping his ordinances, and walking in his statutes and judgments with other saints, in a Gospel church state; which is Christ's kingdom here on earth, where he reigns as King over God's holy hill of Zion, being set there by his Father, from whom he has received this kingdom, and will deliver it to him, when it is complete and perfect. Now those whom Jehovah the Father snatches out of Satan's hands, and breaks in upon their souls with divine light and knowledge, he brings into such a state, and into this kingdom of Christ, who is called "his dear Son": or "the Son of his love"; or "his Son of love"; who being his Son by nature, of the same nature with him, and equal to him, always was, is, and will be, the object of his love, complacency, and delight; as he cannot be otherwise, since he is the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person; and even as this Son of his is in an office capacity, as the Mediator between God and man, he is his elect, in whom his soul delights; and he is always well pleased with all the chosen ones in him, who are the sons of God through him, and always beloved in him. This clause is added, partly to distinguish the kingdom of Christ, into which the saints are brought in this life, from the kingdom of the Father, or the ultimate glory they shall possess hereafter; and partly to express the security of the saints, and their continuance in the love of God, being in the kingdom, and under the care and government of the Son of his love; and also to make way for what the apostle has further to discourse concerning the person, office, and grace of Christ, in the following verses, <p>(e) Shirhashirim Rabba, fol. 25. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>.

This is entirely without analogy in the N. T. mode of conception, according to which not the procreation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>), but the <span class="ital">sending</span> of the Son is referred to the divine love as its act; and the love is not the <span class="ital">essence</span> of God (in the metaphysical sense), but His essential <span class="ital">disposition</span> (the essence in the ethical sense), even in <a href="/1_john/4-8.htm" title="He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.">1 John 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.">1 John 4:16</a>. Consequently it might be explained: “of the Son, whom His love <span class="ital">has sent</span>,” if this were suggested by the context; so far, however, from this being the case, the language refers to the <span class="ital">exalted</span> Christ who <span class="ital">rules</span> (<span class="greekheb">βασιλείαν</span>). The expression itself, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΥἹῸς Τῆς ἈΓΆΠ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span>, is found in the N. T. only here, but could not he chosen more suitably or with deeper feeling to characterize the opposite of the <span class="ital">God-hated</span> element of <span class="greekheb">σκότος</span>, which in its nature is directly opposed to the divine love. The view, that it is meant to be intimated that the sharing in the kingdom brings with it the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΥἹΟΘΕΣΊΑ</span></span></span> (Huther, de Wette), imports what is not expressed, and anticipates the sequel. Holtzmann without ground, and unfairly, asserts that in comparison with <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a> our passage presents “stereotyped modes of connection and turns of an ecclesiastical orator,” under which he includes the Hebraizing <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΥἹῸς Τῆς ἈΓΆΠΗς ΑὐΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> as being thoroughly <span class="ital">un-Pauline</span>—as if the linguistic resources of the apostle could not even extend to an expression which is not indeed elsewhere used by him, but is in the highest degree appropriate to a specially vivid sense of the divine act of love; something sentimental in the best sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[21] This Chiristological outburst runs on in the form of purely positive statement, although having already in view doctrinal dangers of the kind in Colossae. According to Holtzmann, the Christology belongs to the <span class="ital">compiler;</span> the whole passage, vv. 14–20, is <span class="ital">forced and without motive,</span> and it is only in ver. 21 that we find the direct sequel to ver. 13. The latter statement is incorrect. And why should this excursus, as a grand basis for all the exhortations and warnings that follow, be held <span class="ital">without due motive?</span> Holtzmann forms too harsh a judgment as to the whole passage <a href="/context/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;...">Colossians 1:9-23</a>, when he declares it incompatible with any strict exegetical treatment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[22] Theodore of Mopsuestia finds in the expression the contrast that Christ was the Son of God <span class="greekheb">οὐ φύσει</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἀγάπῃ τῆς υἱοθεσίας</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>. Paul now explains how God has qualified them for their share in the heavenly inheritance. On this passage <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a> should be compared; the parallels extend to <a href="/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-14.htm" title=" In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:">Colossians 1:14</a> also.—<span class="greekheb">ἐρύσατο</span>. The aorist refers to the time of conversion. The metaphor implies the miserable state of those delivered and the struggle necessary to deliver them.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίας</span>: “ubi <span class="greekheb">τῇ βασιλείᾳ</span> opponitur, est tyrannis” (Wetstein, so also Chrys., Lightf., Kl[6]). This would heighten the contrast between the power of darkness and the “kingdom of the son of His love”. But Abbott argues forcibly against this view, especially with relation to the N.T. usage. He quotes <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ ἐξουσία τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ</span>, where the contrast obviously cannot be maintained. Grimm takes the term as a collective expression for the demoniacal powers; and Klöpper says that in Paul <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>. is not a mere abstract term, but signifies the possessors of power. Here, however, he rightly sees that the contrast to <span class="greekheb">βας</span>. makes this meaning inappropriate, and that for it <span class="greekheb">ἐρύς</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> would have been expected rather than <span class="greekheb">ἐρύς</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>. Accordingly he interprets it as the dominion possessed by the (personified) darkness.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ σκότους</span>: taken by Hofmann as a genitive of apposition, but the obvious interpretation is to take it as a subjective genitive, the dominion which darkness exercises. We should have expected simply “out of darkness” to correspond to “in light,” but Paul changes the form, partly to insist that the darkness is not a mere state but exercises an active authority, partly to secure a parallel with the kingdom of God’s Son. But we are not justified (with Mey., Kl[7]) in personifying <span class="greekheb">σκότος</span>, for the primary contrast is with <span class="greekheb">φωτί</span> not <span class="greekheb">υἱοῦ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μετέστησεν</span>. Wetstein quotes Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, ix., 11, 1 (Tiglath-Pileser’s deportation of N.E. Israel), and Lightfoot thinks that this use of the word suggested the choice of it here, and this is made more probable by the addition of <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βας</span>. Meyer, however, quotes a striking parallel from Plato, where no such reference is present: <span class="greekheb">ἔκ τε φωτὸς εἰς σκότος μεθισταμένων καὶ ἐκ σκότους εἰς φῶς</span> (<span class="ital">Rep.</span>, p. 518 A).—<span class="greekheb">βασιλείαν</span>. Meyer insists that this is the Messianic kingdom, and as the realisation of this lay in the future to Paul the clause must have a proleptic reference, citizenship in the kingdom being guaranteed by their conversion. But the argument rests on a false premiss, for in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-20.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>, <a href="/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>, the sense is not eschatological. Nor, indeed, can it be so here, for the translation into the kingdom must have taken place at the same time as the deliverance.—<span class="greekheb">υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ</span>. Augustine, followed by Olshausen and Lightfoot, takes <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπης</span> as a genitive of origin, and interprets, the Son begotten of the essence of the Father, which is love. This has no parallel in the N.T., and rests, as Meyer points out, on a confusion of the metaphysical with the ethical essence of God. The phrase is practically equivalent to His beloved Son, but is chosen for the sake of emphasis to indicate His greatness and the excellence of His kingdom. There is, perhaps, the further thought that the love which rests on the Son must rest also on those who are one with Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[6] Klöpper.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[7] Klöpper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13–14</span>.

In secular Greek (as Lightfoot shews) it has a slight tendency to denote excessive or tyrannous dominion. This must not be pressed in the N.T., as a Concordance will shew; but in this Epistle (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>) and its Ephesian companion (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>, <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>, <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>), it certainly takes that direction, referring to evil spiritual powers and their sphere of dominion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Man, in the Fall, so <span class="ital">surrendered himself</span> to the Usurper that, but for the action of his Divine King and Deliverer, he would now lie not merely under the force but under the dominion of his enemy.

Lightfoot, following Augustine, takes this most precious phrase to mean, in effect, <span class="ital">the Son of the Father who is</span> (<a href="/1_john/4-8.htm" title="He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.">1 John 4:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.">1 John 4:16</a>) <span class="ital">Love</span>; the Son who accordingly manifests and as it were embodies the Father’s Love (<a href="/context/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him....">1 John 4:9-10</a>). But surely the more probable meaning is that the Son is the blessed Object of the Father’s love (so Ellicott); the supremely Beloved One (cp. the parallel passage, <a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm" title="To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.">Ephesians 1:6</a>, where see our note). Far from “destroying the whole force of the expression” (Lightfoot), this interpretation is full of ideas in point here. The “kingdom” is what it is to its happy subjects because its King is the Beloved Son, in whom the subjects are therefore not subjects only but sons, and beloved.

The "Son of his love" is not simply the "beloved Son" (<a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.), but the representative and depositary of his love: "Who is his love made manifest" (Augustine, Lightfoot; see ver. 2, note; <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/john/17-26.htm">John 17:26</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-8.htm">1 John 4:8, 9, 14-16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-6</a>; <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>), being at once our "Redeemer King "(ver. 13, 14) and the" Image of the invisible God" (ver. 15). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Power (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/mark/2-10.htm">Mark 2:10</a>.<p>Translated (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>The word occurs five times in the New Testament: of putting out of the stewardship, <a href="/luke/16-4.htm">Luke 16:4</a>; of the removal of Saul from the kingdom, <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>; of Paul turning away much people, <a href="/acts/19-26.htm">Acts 19:26</a>; and of removing mountains, <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>.

It is true that love is the essence of the Son as of the Father; also, that the Son's mission is the revelation of the Father's love; but, as Meyer correctly says, "the language refers to the exalted Christ who rules." </body></html>
