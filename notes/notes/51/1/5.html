Compare the fuller expression of <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1Thessalonians 1:3</a>, “your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope.” But the place assigned to hope in this passage is notable. “For the hope” is really “on account of the hope.” Hence faith and love are spoken of, not merely as leading up to hope, but as being actually kindled by it. Similarly in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a> we find that, while faith and love are taken for granted, there is a special prayer that they may be enlightened “to know the hope of His calling” as the one thing yet needful. The prominence given to the thought of “the heavenly places” in the Epistles of the captivity, and therefore to Christ in heaven, even more than to Christ risen, is evident to any careful student. Accordingly, the hope, which is the instinct of perfection in man, and which becomes realisation of heaven in the Christian, naturally comes out with corresponding emphasis.<p><span class= "bld">Ye heard before.</span>—That is, at their first conversion. There is an implied warning against the new doctrines, which are more fully noticed in the next chapter.<p><span class= "bld">The truth of the gospel.</span>—This expression (as in <a href="/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>) is emphatic. It refers to the gospel, not chiefly as a message of graciousness and mercy, but rather as a revelation of eternal truths, itself changeless as the truth it reveals. There is a corresponding emphasis, but stronger still, in St. John. (See, for example, <a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1John 2:27</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.">1John 5:20</a>; <a href="/context/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2John 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/context/3_john/1-2.htm" title="Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.">3John 1:2-3</a>.) The gospel was now winning its way to supremacy over civilised thought. Hence the need of warning against the sudden growth of wild speculations, contrasted with the unchanging simplicity of its main truths.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/colossians/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Colossians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>THE GOSPEL-HOPE</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘God never sends mouths but He sends meat to feed them,’ says the old proverb. And yet it seems as if that were scarcely true in regard to that strange faculty called Hope. It may well be a question whether on the whole it has given us more pleasure than pain. How seldom it has been a true prophet! How perpetually its pictures have been too highly coloured! It has cast illusions over the future, colouring the far-off hills with glorious purple which, reached, are barren rocks and cold snow. It has held out prizes never won. It has made us toil and struggle and aspire and fed us on empty husks. Either we have not got what we expected or have found it to be less good than it appeared from afar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we think of all the lies that hope has told us, of all the vain expenditure of effort to which it has tempted us, of the little that any of us have of what we began by thinking we should surely attain, hope seems a questionable good, and yet how obstinate it is, living on after all disappointments and drawing the oldest amongst us onwards. Surely somewhere there must be a reason for this great and in some respects awful faculty, a vindication of its existence in an adequate object for its grasp.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The New Testament has much to say about hope. Christianity lays hold of it and professes to supply it with its true nourishment and support. Let us look at the characteristics of Christian hope, or, as our text calls it, the hope of the Gospel, that is, the hope which the Gospel creates and feeds in our souls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. What does it hope for?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The weakness of our earthly hopes is that they are fixed on things which are contingent and are inadequate to make us blessed. Even when tinted with the rainbow hues, which it lends them, they are poor and small. How much more so when seen in the plain colourless light of common day. In contrast with these the objects of the Christian hope are certain and sufficient for all blessedness. In the most general terms they may be stated as ‘That blessed hope, even the appearing of the Great God and our Saviour.’ That is the specific Christian hope, precise and definite, a real historical event, filling the future with a certain steadfast light. Much is lost in the daily experience of all believers by the failure to set that great and precise hope in its true place of prominence. It is often discredited by millenarian dreams, but altogether apart from these it has solidity and substance enough to bear the whole weight of a world rested upon it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That appearance of God brings with it the fulfilment of our highest hopes in the ‘grace that is to be brought to us at His appearing.’ All our blessedness of every kind is to be the result of the manifestation of God in His unobscured glory. The mirrors that are set round the fountain of light flash into hitherto undreamed-of brightness. It is but a variation in terms when we describe the blessedness which is to be the result of God’s appearing as being the Hope of Salvation in its fullest sense, or, in still other words, as being the Hope of Eternal Life. Nothing short of the great word of the Apostle John, that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, exhausts the greatness of the hope which the humblest and weakest Christian is not only allowed but commanded to cherish. And that great future is certainly capable of, and in Scripture receives, a still more detailed specification. We hear, for example, of the hope of Resurrection, and it is most natural that the bodily redemption which Paul calls the adoption of the body should first emerge into distinct consciousness as the principal object of hope in the earliest Christian experience, and that the mighty working whereby Jesus is able to subdue all things unto Himself, should first of all be discerned to operate in changing the body of our humiliation into the body of His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But equally natural was it that no merely corporeal transformation should suffice to meet the deep longings of Christian souls which had learned to entertain the wondrous thought of likeness to God as the certain result of the vision of Him, and so believers ‘wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.’ The moral likeness to God, the perfecting of our nature into His image, will not always be the issue of struggle and restraint, but in its highest form will follow on sight, even as here and now it is to be won by faith, and is more surely attained by waiting than by effort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The highest form which the object of our hope takes is, the Hope of the Glory of God. This goes furthest; there is nothing beyond this. The eyes that have been wearied by looking at many fading gleams and seen them die away, may look undazzled into the central brightness, and we may be sure that even we shall walk there like the men in the furnace, unconsumed, purging our sight at the fountain of radiance, and being ourselves glorious with the image of God. This is the crown of glory which He has promised to them that love Him. Nothing less than this is what our hope has to entertain, and that not as a possibility, but as a certainty. The language of Christian hope is not perhaps this may be, but verily it shall be. To embrace its transcendent certainties with a tremulous faith broken by much unbelief, is sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The grounds on which the hope of the Gospel rests.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The grounds of our earthly hopes are for the most part possibilities, or, at the best, probabilities turned by our wishes into certainties. We moor our ships to floating islands which we resolve to think continents. So our earthly hopes vary indefinitely in firmness and substance. They are sometimes but wishes turned confident, and can never rise higher than their source, or be more certain than it is. At the best they are building on sand. At the surest there is an element of risk in them. One singer indeed may take for his theme ‘The pleasures of Hope,’ but another answers by singing of ‘The fallacies of Hope.’ Earth-born hopes carry no anchor and have always a latent dread looking out of their blue eyes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But it is possible for us to dig down to and build on rock, to have a future as certain as our past, to escape in our anticipations from the region of the Contingent, and this we assuredly do when we take the hope of the Gospel for ours, and listen to Paul proclaiming to us ‘Christ which is our Hope,’ or ‘Christ in you the Hope of glory.’ If our faith grasps Jesus Christ risen from the dead and for us entered into the heavenly state as our forerunner, our hope will see in Him the pattern and the pledge of our manhood, and will begin to experience even here and now the first real though faint accomplishments of itself. The Gospel sets forth the facts concerning Christ which fully warrant and imperatively require our regarding Him as the perfect realised ideal of manhood as God meant it to be, and as bearing in Himself the power to make all men even as He is. He has entered into the fellowship of our humiliation and become bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh that we might become life of His Life and spirit of His Spirit. As certain as it is that ‘we have borne the image of the earthy,’ so certain is it that ‘we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What cruel waste of a divine faculty it is, then, of which we are all guilty when we allow our hopes to be frittered away and dissipated on uncertain and transient goods which they may never secure, and which, even if secured, would be ludicrously or rather tragically insufficient to make us blessed, instead of withdrawing them from all these and fixing them on Him who alone is able to satisfy our hungry souls in all their faculties for ever!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The hope of the Gospel is firm enough to rest our all upon because in it, by ‘two immutable things in which it is impossible that God should lie,’ His counsel and His oath, He has given strong encouragement to them who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before them. Well may the hope for which God’s own eternal character is the guarantee be called ‘sure and steadfast.’ The hope of the Gospel rests at last on the Being and Heart of God. It is that which God ‘who cannot lie hath promised before the world was’ is working towards whilst the world lasts, and will accomplish when the world is no more. He has made known His purpose and has pledged all the energies and tendernesses of His Being to its realisation. Surely on this rock-foundation we may rest secure. The hopes that grow on other soils creep along the surface. The hope of the Gospel strikes its roots deep into the heart of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. What the hope of the Gospel is and does for us.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We cannot do better than to lay hold of some of the New Testament descriptions of it. We recall first that great designation ‘A good hope through grace.’ This hope is no illusion; it does not come from fumes of fancy or the play of imagination. The wish is not father to the thought. We do not make bricks without straw nor spin ropes of sand on the shore of the great waste sea that waits to swallow us up. The cup of Tantalus has had its leaks stopped; the sieve carries the treasure unspilled. The rock can be rolled to the hill-top. All the disappointments, fallacies, and torments of hope pass away. It never makes ashamed. We have a solid certainty as solid as memory. The hope which is through grace is the full assurance of hope, and that full assurance is just what every other hope lacks. In that region and in that region only we can either say I hope or I know.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another designation is ‘A lively hope.’ It is no poor pale ghost brightening and fading, fading and brightening, through which one can see the stars shine, and of little power in practical life, but strong and vigorous and not the least active amongst the many forces that make up the sum of our lives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is most significantly designated as ‘The blessed hope.’ All others quickly pass into sorrows. This alone gives lasting joys, for this alone is blessed whilst it is only anticipation, and still more blessed when its blossoms ripen into full fruition. In all earthly hopes there is an element of unrest, but the hope of the Gospel is so remote, so certain, and so satisfying, that it works stillness, and they who most firmly grasp it ‘do with patience wait for it.’ Earthly hopes have little moral effect and often loosen the sinews of the soul, and are distinctly unfavourable to all strenuous effort. But ‘every man that hath this hope in Jesus purifieth himself even as He is pure,’ and the Apostle, whose keen insight most surely discerns the character-building value of the fundamental facts of Christian experience, was not wrong when he bid us find in the hope of the Gospel deeply rooted within us the driving force of the most strenuous efforts after purity like His whom it is our deepest desire and humble hope to become like.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let us remember the double account which Scripture gives of the discipline by which the hope of the Gospel is won for our very own. On the one hand, we have ‘joy and peace in believing, that we may abound in hope.’ Our faith breeds hope because it grasps the divine facts concerning Jesus from which hope springs. And faith further breeds hope because it kindles joy and peace, which are the foretastes and earnests of the future blessedness. On the other hand, the very opposite experiences work to the same end, for ‘tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.’ Sorrow rightly borne tests for us the power of the Gospel and the reality of our faith, and so gives us a firmer grip of hope and of Him on whom in the last result it all depends. Out of this collision of flint and steel the spark springs. The water churned into foam and tortured in the cataract has the fair bow bending above it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But this discipline will not achieve its result, therefore comes the exhortation to us all, ‘Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end.’ The hope of the Gospel is the one thing that we need. Without it all else is futile and frail. God alone is worthy to have the whole weight and burden of a creature’s hope fixed on Him, and it is an everlasting truth that they who are ‘without God in the world’ also ‘have no hope.’ Saints of old held fast by an assurance, which they must often have felt left many questions still to be asked, and because they were sure that they were continually with Him, were also sure of His guidance through life and of His afterwards receiving them to glory. But for us the twilight has broadened into day, and we shall be wise if, knowing our defencelessness, and forsaking all the lies and illusions of this vain present, we flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us in the Gospel. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven - That is, "I give thanks that there is such a hope laid up for you." The evidence which he had that this hope was theirs, was founded on the faith and love to the saints which he heard they had evinced. He fully believed that where there was such faith and love, there was a well-founded hope of heaven. The word "hope" here is used, as it often is, for the thing hoped for. The object of hope - to wit, eternal happiness, was reserved for them in heaven.<p>Whereof ye heard before - When the gospel was first preached to you.

For&#8212;to be joined with the words immediately preceding: "The love which ye have to all the saints because of (literally, 'on account of') the hope," &c. The hope of eternal life will never be in us an inactive principle but will always produce "love." This passage is abused by Romanists, as if the hope of salvation depended upon works. A false argument.

The law is the word of truth; and many of the words of men, of the philosophers, were words of truth; but it was not in either of them they had heard of eternal life laid up in heaven; of which there were hopes to be entertained by sinful creatures, enjoying it through Christ: this is what only the Gospel brings an account of; life and immortality are only brought to light by the Gospel; which not only speaks of it, but lays that before men, which give them ground and encouragement to hope for it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span><p>(d) For the glory that is hoped for.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;">Colossians 1:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">on account of the hope</span>, etc., does not belong to <span class="greekheb">εὐχαρ</span>. <a href="/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a> (Bengel, “ex <span class="ital">spe</span> patet, quanta sit causa <span class="ital">gratias agendi</span> pro dono fidei et amoris;” comp.

This is connected by Bengel, followed by several recent commentators (Hofm., Kl[2], Ol., Haupt, Weiss, Abb.), with <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστοῦμεν</span>. Having heard of their faith and love, Paul gives thanks for the hope laid up for them in heaven. Lightfoot and Soden urge that in this way the triad of Christian graces, faith, hope and love, is broken up. But “hope” is objective here, not the grace of hope, but the object of that hope. It is true that Paul glides from the subjective to the objective use of <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span> in <a href="/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>, but if this combination had been intended here he would probably have simply co-ordinated the three terms. A more serious objection is that <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστ</span>. is so far away, though Haupt urges that <span class="greekheb">διὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλπ</span>. could not have come in earlier. Further, Paul never uses this constr. <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διὰ</span>. It is also his custom, at the beginning of his Epistles, to give thanks for the Christian character of his readers (which he hardly does in <a href="/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>), not for the heavenly reward that awaits them. Others (De W., Lightf., Sod.) connect it with <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πίστιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπην</span>. This gives a good sense, their faith and love have their ground in their hope of reward. But we should have expected the article before a clause thus added to substantives. It is simplest to refer it to <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἔχετε</span> (Chrys., Mey., Ell., Alf., Franke), and interpret it of the love which is due to the hope of a heavenly reward.

The reference in <span class="greekheb">προ</span>. is disputed. Bengel and Klöpper think it means before the writing of this letter; Meyer, Hofmann and Haupt before its fulfilment. But more probably it is to be taken of their first hearing of the Gospel (so Lightf., Ol., Abb.), perhaps in tacit contrast to the false teaching they had recently heard. Haupt, it is true, denies that there is any reference to the false teachers in <a href="/context/colossians/1-2.htm" title=" To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ....">Colossians 1:2-8</a>; but though none can be proved, it is surely probable that the turn of several expressions should be determined by the subject which was uppermost in the Apostle’s mind, and that he should thus prepare his readers for the direct attack.—<span class="greekheb">λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13</a>, according to which <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγ</span>. should be taken as in apposition to <span class="greekheb">λόγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλ</span>., “the word of truth, even the Gospel,” though it is often explained as the word of truth announced in the Gospel.

"Hope" is <span class="accented">objective - matter of hope</span>, as in <a href="/galatians/5-5.htm">Galatians 5:5</a>; <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>. St. Paul speaks most of <span class="accented">heaven</span> and <span class="accented">heavenly things</span> in the letters of this period. Ver. 4 gives the nearest grammatical connection for this clause; and many recent commentators, following Greek interpreters, accordingly find here that which "evokes and conditions" the Colossians' "love" (Meyer, Ellicott) or "faith and love" (De Wette, Lightfoot). But this construction we reject. For it makes the heavenly reward the reason of the Colossians' present (faith and) love, reversing the true and Pauline order of thought (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>; <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; comp. <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17, 18</a>); while, on the other hand, the heavenly hope is the last and highest ground of the apostle's thanksgivings and encouragements, and the forfeiture or impairing of it the chief matter of his fears and warnings throughout the Epistles of this group (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 22, 23, 27, 28</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11-21</a>: comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>). It is better, therefore, with Bengel, Hofmann, Klopper, Conybeare, Eadie, and others, from Athanasius downwards, to refer ver. 5 as well as ver. 4 to the principal verb, "we give thanks" (ver. 3). What the apostle hears of "the faith and love" of the Colossian brethren moves him to give thanks for "the hope which is in store for them in heaven." Of that hope this faith and love are to him a pledge and an earnest, even as the "seal of the Spirit" (<a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>) and the "peace of Christ in their hearts" (<a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; see note) are to themselves. Similarly, in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4, 5</a>, from the present faith and patience of the saints the certainty of their future blessedness is argued. By singling out this <span class="accented">hope</span> as chief matter of thanksgiving here, the apostle enhances its certainty and its value in his readers' eyes. (On this verse, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 74-80.) From the <span class="accented">general occasion and ground</span> of his thanksgiving in the Christian state and prospects of his readers, St. Paul proceeds to dwell on certain <span class="accented">special circumstances</span> which enhanced his gratitude to God (vers. 56-8). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (hope) <span class="cmt_word">ye heard of before, in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span> or, <span class="accented">good tidings</span> (vers. 7, 23; <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 21</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13-15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). There is a veiled polemic reference in "the word of <span class="accented">the truth</span> of the gospel" (comp. ver. 7 and parallels from Galatians). The word "before" (<span class="accented">aforetime</span>) "contrasts their earlier with their later lessons, the true gospel of Epaphras with the false gospel of recent teachers" (Lightfoot). Others interpret, less suitably: <span class="accented">heard already</span> (<span class="accented">before my writing</span>), or <span class="accented">heard beforehand</span> (<span class="accented">before the fulfilment of the hope</span>). It is in St. Paul's manner to refer his readers at the outset to their conversion and first Christian experiences (see parallel passages). Their <span class="accented">hope</span> was directly at stake in the controversy with Colossian error. Here we meet the first of those cumulative combinations of nouns, so marked a feature of the style of Colossians and Ephesians, which are made a reproach against these Epistles by some critics; but each is appropriate in its place. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For the hope (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;)<p>The A.V. connects with we give thanks (<a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>). But the two are too far apart, and Paul's introductory thanksgiving is habitually grounded on the spiritual condition of his readers, not on something objective. See <a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>. Better connect with what immediately precedes, love which ye have, and render as Rev., because of the hope, etc. Faith works by love, and the ground of their love is found in the hope set before them. Compare <a href="/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>. The motive is subordinate, but legitimate. "The hope laid up in heaven is not the deepest reason or motive for faith and love, but both are made more vivid when it is strong. It is not the light at which their lamps are lit, but it is the odorous oil which feeds their flame" (Maclaren). Hope. See on <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>. In the New Testament the word signifies both the sentiment of hope and the thing hoped for. Here the latter. Compare <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-5.htm">Galatians 5:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>; also <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>, where both meanings appear. Lightfoot observes that the sense oscillates between the subjective feeling and the objective realization. The combination of faith, hope, and love is a favorite one with Paul. See <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6-12</a>.<p>Laid up (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., laid away, as the pound in the napkin, <a href="/luke/19-20.htm">Luke 19:20</a>.

It is variously explained as denoting either an undefined period in the past, or as contrasting the earlier Christian teaching with the later heresies, or as related to Paul's letter (before I wrote), or as related to the fulfillment of the hope (ye have had the hope pre-announced). It occurs several times in Herodotus in this last sense, as ii. 5, of one who has heard of Egypt without seeing it: v., 86, of the Aeginetans who had learned beforehand what the Athenians intended. Compare viii. 79; vi. 16. Xenophon uses it of a horse, which signifies by pricking up its ears what it hears beforehand. In the sense of mere priority of time without the idea of anticipation, Plato: "Hear me once more, though you have heard me say the same before" ("Laws," vii., 797). I incline to the more general reference, ye heard in the past. The sense of hearing before the fulfillment of the hope would seem rather to require the perfect tense, since the hope still remained unfulfilled.<p>The word of the truth of the Gospel<p>The truth is the contents of the word, and the Gospel defines the character of the truth. </body></html>
