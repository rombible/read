They had been full of faith, love, and hope, the fruit of a true gospel preached by Epaphras; there was fear now lest they should be beguiled from it, although that fear was obviously not yet realised, as had been formerly the case with the Galatians. Hence St. Paul’s emphasis on their hearing, knowing, and learning the truth, and on the faithfulness of Epaphras as a minister of Christ.<p>(3, 4) Comp. <a href="/context/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15-16</a>, where there is an almost exact verbal coincidence.

At the time this epistle was written, probably A.D. 64, the gospel had been preached and received in most of the countries within the Roman empire, and had produced a great change in the manners of those who received it. The apostle made this observation to confirm the Colossians in the faith of the gospel, which, by its rapid progress, and happy influence in reforming mankind, was plainly declared to be from God. <span class="ital">As also in you </span>— Among whom it hath produced a great reformation; <span class="ital">since the day ye heard it, and knew, </span>or acknowledged, <span class="ital">the grace of God in truth </span>— Truly experienced its efficacy in your hearts. <span class="ital">As ye learned of Epaphras </span>— From the epistle to Philemon, (<a href="/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>,) which was sent at the same time with this to the Colossians, it appears that Epaphras was in prison at Rome when the apostle wrote.

Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We give thanks to God - See the notes at the parallel place in <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15-16</a>.<p>Praying always for you - See the <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>, note; <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a>, note; compare <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Meaning himself and Timothy. This is the beginning of the epistle, which is introduced with a thanksgiving to God; to whom praise and thankfulness are always due as a Creator and preserver, as the author of all good things, as the Father of mercies, temporal and spiritual, and as the covenant God and Father of his people through Christ: wherefore it follows, <p>and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; the sense of which either is, that God the Father, who is the object of praise and thanksgiving, is both the God of Christ, and the Father of Christ, the God of Christ, as Christ is man, and the Father of Christ, as Christ is God; or the latter is exegetical of the former, and may be rendered thus, "God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ": and very properly are thanks given to him under this character, because it is as he is the Father of Christ that he blesses his people with all spiritual blessings; and because he is their God, as well as his God; and their Father, as well as his Father, though in a different sense, his by nature, theirs by adoption. Moreover, as all their blessings come from God, as the Father of Christ, and through Christ, and for his sake, so it is very proper that thanks should be returned unto him under that character; and through Christ, by whom alone such sacrifices of praise are acceptable to God: it is added, <p>praying always for you; which, as it is expressive of the constant discharge of the duty of prayer, and the continual remembrance of these saints in it, and shows the affection the apostle had for them; so it points out the time when, and the way and manner in which Paul and Timothy gave thanks to God on account of them; it was when they were at the throne of grace, and in their frequent prayers to God; thankfulness for mercies received, both by ourselves and others, being a branch of the duty of prayer. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> We give thanks to God and the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</span><p>(1) He commends the doctrine that was delivered to them by Epaphras, and their readiness in receiving it.<p>(c) We cannot otherwise think of God to be our salvation, except that he is Christ's Father, in whom we are adopted.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a> f.

For the Epistle to the Colossians bears considerable resemblance to the two epistles to which it is subjoined: to the Epistle to the Ephesians, in its general subject (thesis) and mode of exhortation (paraclesis); to the Epistle to the Philippians, in its opposition to the false teachers, and in their refutation. More of these coincidences will be noticed in their proper places. The Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians were sent at the same time by Tychicus, <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πάντοτε</span>, <span class="ital">always</span>) Construed with <span class="ital">praying:</span> <a href="/romans/1-10.htm" title="Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.">Romans 1:10</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-4.htm" title="Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,">Php 1:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-8.</span> - The <span class="accented">opening thanksgiving</span> is full and appropriate. Its content is determined by the state of this Church, and by the apostle's relation to it through Epaphras, and his own present position. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We give thanks to God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="accented">We</span>; <span class="accented">Timothy and I</span> (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>, etc.). The Revised Text omits "and" between" God" and "Father," following Lachmann, Westcott and Heft, and Lightfoot (who hesitates), on evidence numerically slight, but sufficient; especially as in every other instance of this combination the conjunction is present. "Father" is also without definite article in the better attested (Revised) reading. The words, "Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," bear, therefore, an explanatory, quasi-predicative force. St. Paul wishes his readers to understand that he gives thanks to God on their account distinctly under this aspect, regarded as <span class="accented">"Father</span> of Christ." He has just spoken <span class="accented">of "our</span> Father," and now adds, "Father of our Lord Jesus <span class="accented">Christ,"</span> suggesting that it is in this relation that we know God as <span class="accented">"our</span> Father," the Author of grace and peace, the Object of Christian thanksgiving. So the sovereign and exclusive mediation of Christ, the ruling idea of the whole Epistle, is thrown into bold relief at the outset; and, in this light, the unique omissions of vers. 2 and 3 explain and justify each other. This fatherhood embraces the entire Person and offices of the Son as "our Lord Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Praying always for you</span> (ver. 9; <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>; <a href="/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>). The apostle had known from the first of the existence of this Church; and had already been in communication with it (see Introduction, &sect; 2). He had, therefore, a general prayerful interest in the Colossians (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>), that has been quickened to joyful thanksgiving (<a href="/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>; comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6-10</a>) by the arrival of Epaphras. "Always" and <span class="accented">"for</span> you" - either or both of the phrases  - may be joined grammatically to <span class="accented">"we</span> give thanks" or to "praying:" the latter connection is preferable (see Alford or Ellicott); similarly in <a href="/philemon/1-4.htm">Philemon 1:4</a>; in <a href="/ephesians/1-16.htm">Ephesians 1:16</a> the turn of expression is different. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And the Father<p>Some of the best texts omit and.
