Such variation can hardly be accidental. Could it have been suggested to St. Paul’s mind, in connection with his special desire to emphasize the true Godhead of Christ, so obvious in this Epistle, by an instinctive reluctance to use in this case any phrase, however customary with him, which might even seem to distinguish His nature from the Godhead? It is certainly notable that in the true reading of <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a> Christ is called “the mystery of God, even the Father”—an unique and remarkable expression, which marks a preparation for the full understanding of the teaching of our Lord, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father” (<a href="/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grace be unto you - See the notes at <a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

This is the inscription of the epistle, in which the persons wrote unto are described as "saints", or holy men; not by birth, for all are unholy and unclean by nature; nor by baptism, for that neither takes away sin, nor gives grace; nor merely externally, by an outward reformation; but by separation, being by an act of eternal election set apart for God, for holiness, and happiness; and by imputation, Christ being made sanctification to them; and by the sanctifying grace of the Spirit of God in regeneration, being called with an holy calling, and having principles of grace and holiness wrought in them, and they formed as new men in righteousness and true holiness: and as "brethren"; being born of God, having him for their Father, and being of his household, and a part of the family in heaven and earth named of Christ, and heirs together of the grace of life, and of the heavenly glory: and as "faithful" ones; true and sincere believers in Christ, constant and persevering in the faith of him; faithful to the Gospel, and their profession of it, and to Christ, whose name they bore, and to one another, to whom they stood in the relation of brethren: and all this "in Christ"; and by, and through him; they were saints in him; they were chosen in him, and sanctified in him their head, and received all their holiness from him; they were brethren in him the firstborn of them; his God being their God, and his Father their Father; and had their faith and faithfulness from him, as well as it was exercised towards, and on him: and they are further described by the place of their abode, <p>which are at Colosse: a city of Phrygia: <p>grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the salutation, and which stands in this form in most of Paul's epistles; See Gill on <a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>. The Syriac version puts "peace" before "grace", and leaves out the last clause, "and the Lord Jesus Christ"; as does also the Ethiopic version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Colosse: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><p>(b) Colosse is situated in Phrygia, not far from Hierapolis and Laodicea, on that side that faces toward Lycia and Pamphylia.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/1-2.htm" title=" To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Colossians 1:2</a>. Paul does not address the Church as a Church. This has been explained by the fact that he stood in no official relation to the community, and therefore addressed individuals. But he does not mention the Church in <span class="ital">Philippians</span>, though he had founded it. The omission may be accidental; but he seems to have changed his custom in his later Epistles, since it occurs in all his letters to Churches from <span class="ital">Romans</span> downwards.—<span class="greekheb">ἁγίοις</span> may be an adjective (so Kl.[1], Weiss and others), but more probably a substantive (so Mey., Ell., Lightf., Ol., Sod., Haupt, Abb.), since Paul seems not to use it in the plural in an adjectival sense, except in <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a>, and in the salutations of 2 Cor., Eph. and Phil. it is certainly a substantive. Like <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοῖς</span> it may be joined with <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χ</span>., but should more probably be taken by itself. The saints are those who are set apart for God, as belonging to His holy people, the Israel of God (<a href="/galatians/6-16.htm" title="And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.">Galatians 6:16</a>); the privileges of the chosen nation under the Old Covenant being transferred to Christians under the New.—<span class="greekheb">πιστοῖς</span>: not to be taken in the passive sense (as by Ew., Ell., Lightf., Abb., R.V.) = “steadfast,” “faithful,” with tacit reference to the falling away to false doctrine. Combined with <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφ</span>. its meaning would be faithful to Paul, which would have no point here. It should be taken here, as by most commentators, in the sense of “believing”.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span>. It is significant that <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> occurs alone very frequently in this Epistle, but <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς</span> never (though <span class="greekheb">Κυρίου ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span>, <a href="/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a>; <span class="greekheb">Κυρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησ</span>., <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>). No doubt this is to be accounted for by the need for emphasis on the doctrine of the Person of Christ.—<span class="greekheb">χάρις ὑμῖν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>. This combination is found in all the Epistles that claim to be Paul’s except the Pastorals, where it is modified. The formula, which was probably constructed by Paul, combines the Greek and Hebrew forms of salutation.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν</span>. This is not added in 1 Thess. The other Epistles add <span class="greekheb">καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>. No importance is to be attached to their omission here. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the similarly shortened form <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις μεθʼ ὑμῶν</span> (<a href="/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul.

It is true that this is the language of “charitable presumption” (Pearson, <span class="ital">Exposition of the Creed</span>, Art. ix. p. 353); when a community is thus described St Paul does not thereby positively assert that each individual answers the description. But this presumptive use of the word “saint” does not lower the true sense of the word so as to make it <span class="ital">properly</span> mean merely a member of the baptized community, a possessor of visible Church privileges. “The saints” are <span class="ital">supposed</span> to be really separated to God, by purchase, conquest, and self-surrender.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">faithful</span>] The adjective is used of Christians frequently; see (in the Greek) <a href="/acts/10-45.htm" title="And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 10:45</a>; <a href="/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-2.htm" title=" To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Colossians 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-16.htm" title="If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:16</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-2.htm" title="And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.

These and similar passages, and the contrast of the word “unfaithful” (<span class="ital">infidelis</span>, infidel), shew that as a designation of Christians it means not trustworthy but trustful; <span class="ital">full of faith</span>, in the Christian sense. The “faithful” are (see last note) <span class="ital">supposed</span> to be those who have really “believed unto life everlasting” (<a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm" title="However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.">1 Timothy 1:16</a>) and now “walk by faith” (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">brethren</span>] Because “children of God by faith in Christ Jesus” (<a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>; and see next note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Christ</span>] See for parallels to this all-important phrase, <a href="/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; &c.

They are “brethren <span class="ital">in Christ</span>,” brothers because “in” the Firstborn Son (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>).—This phrase occurs some 12 times in the Epistle, and closely kindred phrases raise the number to about 20. It is likely that the special doctrinal perils of Colossæ led to this emphasis on the Christian’s union with Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Colosse</span>] Properly <span class="ital">Colossœ (Colassai</span>), or <span class="ital">Colassœ</span>. On the spelling, see <span class="ital">Introd</span>., p. 20, and on the topography of Colossæ and its neighbourhood, <span class="ital">Introd</span>., ch. 1 generally.—The older English Versions read <span class="ital">Colise</span> (Wyclif, 1380), <span class="ital">Colossa</span> (Tyndale, 1534, Cranmer, 1539, Rheims 1582), <span class="ital">Collossœ</span> (Geneva, 1557).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verse thus far may perhaps be rendered more exactly, <span class="bld">To those who at Colossæ are holy and faithful brethren in Christ</span>.

In the Pastoral Epistles, and in 2 Joh., the remarkable addition “<span class="ital">mercy</span>” appears; in Jude, “<span class="ital">mercy, peace, and love</span>.”—In these salutations “<span class="ital">Grace</span>” is all the free and loving favour of God in its spiritual efficacy; “<span class="ital">Peace</span>” is specially the complacency of reconciliation with which He regards His people, but so as to imply also its results <span class="ital">in</span> them; repose, serenity of soul; happiness in its largest sense. See further on <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15</a> below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from God our Father</span>] To St Paul, God is the <span class="ital">Pater Noster</span> of Christians, in the inner sense of their union by faith with His Son. The Scriptures, while not ignoring a certain universal Fatherhood of God, always tend to put into the foreground the Fatherhood and Sonship of special connexion, of covenant, grace, faith. Among many leading passages see <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.">Romans 8:14</a> &c.; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not....">1 John 3:1-2</a>.—Cp. the Editor’s <span class="ital">Outlines of Christian Doctrine</span>, p. 34.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the Lord Jesus Christ</span>] These words, present in the parallel passage <a href="/ephesians/1-2.htm" title="Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.">Ephesians 1:2</a>, are probably to be omitted here, on documentary evidence.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To those in Colossae</span> (which are) <span class="cmt_word">saints and faithful brethren in Christ</span> (<a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>).

Grace</span> is the source of all blessing as bestowed by God (ver. 6; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>; <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2, 17, 21</a>; <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>); and <span class="accented">peace</span>, in the large sense of its Hebrew original, of all blessing as experienced by man (<a href="/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16, 17</a>; <a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>; <a href="/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>; <a href="/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From God our Father.</span> Among the apostle's salutations this alone fails to add "and from our Lord Jesus Christ" - a defect which copyists were tempted to remedy. The omission is well established (see Revised Text, and critical editors generally), and cannot surely be accidental. In this and the twin Ephesian letter, devoted as they are to the glory of Christ, the name of <span class="accented">the Father</span> stands out with a peculiar prominence and dignity, much as in St. John's Gospel: "honouring the Son," they must needs "honour the Father" also (vers. 12, 13; <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-6.htm">Ephesians 4:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Colossae<p>The form of the name appears to have been both Kolossai and Kolassai, the former being probably the earlier.<p>The city was in Phrygia, in the valley of the Lycus, about ten or twelve miles beyond Laodicaea and Hierapolis. The region is volcanic, and the earthquakes common to large portions of Asia Minor are here peculiarly severe. The tributaries of the Lycus carried calcareous matter which formed everywhere deposits of travertine, said to be among the most remarkable formations of this character in the world. "Ancient monuments are buried, fertile lands overlaid, river-beds choked up, and streams diverted, fantastic grottos and cascades and arches of stone formed by this strange, capricious power, at once destructive and creative, working silently and relentlessly through long ages. Fatal to vegetation, these incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the ground. Gleaming like glaciers on the hillside, they attract the eye of the traveler at a distance of twenty miles, and form a singularly striking feature in scenery of more than common beauty and impressiveness" (Lightfoot).<p>The fertility of the region was nevertheless great. The fine sheep, and the chemical qualities of the streams which made the waters valuable for dyeing purposes, fostered a lively trade in dyed woolen goods. All the three cities were renowned for the brilliancy of their dyes.<p>Colossae stood at the junction of the Lycus with two other streams, on a highway between eastern and western Asia, and commanding the approaches to a pass in the Cadmus mountains. Both Herodotus and Xenophon speak of it as a prosperous and great city; but in Paul's time its glory had waned. Its site was at last completely lost, and was not identified until the present century. Its ruins are insignificant. Paul never visited either of the three cities. The church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed.<p>To the saints<p>A mode of address which characterizes Paul's later epistles. The word is to be taken as a noun, and not construed as an adjective with faithful brethren: to the holy and faithful brethren.<p>And faithful brethren in Christ<p>Or believing brethren. Compare <a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>. There is no singling out of the faithful brethren from among others who are less faithful.<p>Our Father<p>The only instance in which the name of the Father stands in the opening benediction of an epistle without the addition and Jesus Christ. </body></html>
