But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh.

Largely parallel to <a href="/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:...">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>. Paul proceeds to point out that so far from securing spiritual growth of a higher order, the false teaching, by loosening the hold on Christ, prevented any growth at all, since it obstructed or severed the very channel of spiritual life.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ κρατῶν τὴν κεφαλήν</span>: “and not holding fast the head”. For this sense of <span class="greekheb">κρ</span>. with the accusative <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/songs/3-4.htm" title="It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.">Song of Solomon 3:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκράτησα αὐτὸν καὶ οὐκ ἀφήκα αὐτόν</span>. It is clear from this that the false teachers were Christians. They did not profess to have no hold upon Christ, but their hold was not firm. All the supplies of life and energy flow from the Head, so that loose connexion with it involves serious loss and not progress in the spiritual life. It is significant that here each member is recognised as having an immediate relation to the Head.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span>: not neuter, referring to <span class="greekheb">κεφ</span>., for <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἧς</span> would have been more natural, but “from whom”. It should be connected with both participles.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ σῶμα</span>: “the whole body”. Alford takes it “the body in its every part,” but Ellicott denies that any distinction between <span class="greekheb">τὸ πᾶν σῶνα</span>. and <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ σῶνα</span> can be safely drawn. It is the body as a whole that increases, and thus Paul condemns the tendencies to intellectual or spiritual exclusiveness, which cripple alike the body and the members who exhibit such tendencies. As this increase continues each member shares in the body’s progress.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων</span>. Lightfoot gives a very full discussion of these terms and their use in medical writers. He translates “through the junctures and ligaments”. No doubt Paul’s language is popular, not technical. He is speaking of the means by which the various parts of the body are supplied and knit together. Meyer takes <span class="greekheb">ἁφ</span>. to mean sensations or nerve impulses, but we have no evidence for this meaning; nor is it suitable here, for there is no reason for referring <span class="greekheb">ἁφ</span>. to <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">συνδ</span>. to <span class="greekheb">συνβιβ</span>. No explanation is given of <span class="greekheb">ἁφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνδ</span>. Some think of the Holy Spirit, others of brotherly love, others of ministers. But probably in Paul’s mind they did not correspond to anything definitely.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιχορηγούμενον καὶ συνβιβαζόμενον</span>. “being supplied and united”. Often the supply is thought to be of nourishment, but perhaps we should interpret more generally of life. <span class="greekheb">ἁφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συν</span>. are thus the media through which life is communicated and the unity of the organism secured.—<span class="greekheb">αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>: “increaseth with the increase of God”. Generally <span class="greekheb">αὔξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. is explained to mean the growth which God gives (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). Against this is the fact that Christ is referred to as the source of growth.

The other cognate thought, of the cohesion of the parts and limbs <span class="ital">with each other</span>, is not present, at least not prominent. The Christian has here to be warned that nothing must make him lose or loosen his own direct communion with Christ his Head.—The physical imagery must not be pressed. In our body, doubtless, the central forces of the organism affect the remoter structures through the nearer. But the mystical Body is such that, while it is a true organism as a whole, yet all the while individually “the Head of <span class="ital">every man</span>” (in Christ) “is Christ” (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; cp. <span class="ital">ibid</span>. <a href="/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>).

In an interesting note he goes on to explain the perfect fitness of St Paul’s imagery of the Head and Body, in the light of modern physiological discoveries. “The volition communicated from the brain to the limbs, the sensations of the extremities telegraphed back to the brain, the absolute mutual sympathy between the head and the members, the instantaneous paralysis ensuing on the interruption of continuity, all these add to the completeness and life of the image.” He then gives instances of ancient scientific speculation on the seat and distribution of vital power in the human body; and concludes: “Bearing in mind all this diversity of opinion among ancient physiologists, we cannot fail to be struck in the text not only with the correctness of the image but also with the propriety of the terms; and we are forcibly reminded that among the Apostle’s most intimate companions at this time was one whom he calls ‘the beloved physician’ (<a href="/colossians/4-14.htm" title=" Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.">Colossians 4:14</a>).”—Such subsidiary assistance, if used by the Apostle, would leave untouched the authority of inspiration in the resulting language.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ κρατῶν</span>, <span class="ital">not holding</span>) He who does not hold Christ solely and above all others, does not hold Him at all.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν κεφαλὴγ</span>, <span class="ital">the Head</span>) Here faith has a foundation whereon it may be fixed.

In the last verse the errorist was judged "out of his own mouth," and the intrinsic hollowness of his pretensions was exposed. Now" he appears before the judgment seat of Christ," charged with high treason against him, the Lord alike of the kingdoms of nature and of grace. So the apostle falls back once more (comp. ver. 10) on the foundation laid down in <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, on which his whole polemic rests. Both in creation and redemption, the philosophic Judaists assigned to the angels a <span class="accented">role</span> inconsistent with the sovereign mediatorship of Christ (see notes on vers. 10 and 15). <span class="cmt_word">From whom all the body, through its joinings and bands being supplied and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). Disloyalty to "the head" works destruction to "the body," which in this case "proceeds from" ("grows out of," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>,) its Head, while it depends upon him. Gnosticism from the beginning tended to disintegrate the Church, by the caste feeling (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>, note; Colossians 3:11) and the sectarian spirit to which it gave birth (ver. 8; <a href="/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). Its vague and subjective doctrines were ready to assume a different form with each new exponent, Here lies the connection between this and the Ephesian letter, the doctrine of the Church following upon and growing out of that of the person of Christ, each being threatened - the latter immediately, the former more remotely  - by the rise of the new Judaeo-Christian mystic rationalism. Colossians asserts the "thou in me" of <a href="/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a>; Ephesians the corresponding "I in them;" and both the consequent "they made perfect in one" (comp., especially, <a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a> and Ephesians 4:7-16 with <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a> and Colossians 2:9-15). (On "body," see note, <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> signifies, not "joints "as parts of the bony skeleton, but includes all points of contact and connection in the body; Latin <span class="accented">nexus, junetura</span> (see Lightfoot). Bengel and Meyer, following Chrysostom, interpret it as "senses," or "nerves;" but this does not commend itself either lexically or contextually. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (comp. <a href="/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a>) are the "ligaments," the stronger and more distinct connections that give the bodily framework unity and solidity. So, by the organic cooperation of the whole structure, the body of Christ is <span class="accented">furnished with its supplies</span>, enabled to receive and dispense to each member the needed sustenance; and "knit together" (ver. 2), drawn into a close and firm unity. "Supplied" (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>) indicates a sustenance both required and due.

"The increase of God" is that which God bestows (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>), as it proceeds "from Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: ver. 10; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>), in whom is "the fulness of the Godhead" (ver. 9: comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a> and Ephesians 3:17  - 19). In <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> the same idea is expressed in almost the same terms. There, however, the growth appears as proper to the body, resulting from its very constitution; here, as a bestowment of God, dependent, therefore, upon Christ, and ceasing if the Church ceases to <span class="accented">hold fast</span> to him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Holding the head (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Holding by or fast, as commonly in the New Testament.
