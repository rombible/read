The reason of that anxiety is found in the “beguiling and enticing words” of an incipient Gnosticism. But “though absent in the body” he rejoices in the steadfastness of their faith, and only exhorts them to continue in it, deepening and enlarging it, but never changing its essence.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">What great conflict.</span>—The word is here repeated from the “striving” of the previous verse, which is, in the original, the cognate verb. It is the same word which is used in <a href="/philippians/1-30.htm" title="Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.">Philippians 1:30</a> (“conflict”), in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1Thessalonians 2:2</a> (“contention”), in <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1Timothy 6:12</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a> (“the good fight of faith”). Evidently it describes the intense earnestness of the whole struggle against evil which he was undergoing for them; but perhaps, looking at <a href="/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a>, we may refer it especially to “striving in prayer” for them. It is probably dwelt upon here to show why, although unknown to them personally, he yet writes so urgently to them.<p><span class= "bld">And for them at Laodicea.</span>—Comp. <a href="/colossians/4-13.htm" title=" For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.">Colossians 4:13</a>, “For you, and for them that are in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.” These three cities lay near together in the valley of Lycus, a tributary of the Mæander; probably they were converted at one time, and are evidently regarded as forming one Christian community, for which Epaphras, the evangelist of Colossæ, felt himself responsible. Colossæ and Laodicea are actually directed to exchange the apostolic Letters sent to them (see <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm" title=" And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.">Colossians 4:16</a>, and Note there), and to read both alike in the churches. (See Dr. Lightfoot’s admirable description of “The Churches of the Lycus,” prefixed to his commentary on this Epistle.) Of Laodicea, the greatest and richest of the three cities, we have no further notice in Scripture, except that stern apocalyptic letter (<a href="/context/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14-22</a>), which has made its name proverbial for spiritual luke-warmness and presumptuous self-reliance. It has been noticed that in this Letter our Lord is called “the beginning of the creation of God.” (See <a href="/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15-18</a> of this Epistle.) Of Colossæ and Hierapolis we read only in this Epistle. It is notable (see Dr. Lightfoot’s Essay) that while Hierapolis and Laodicea play a prominent part in the subsequent history of Christianity in Asia Minor, Colossæ never attains importance, and has left but “few and meagre” remains, compared with the magnificent ruins of the other cities.<p><span class= "bld">As many as have not seen my face.</span>—This description doubtless indicates Hierapolis; but the whole context shows that it also includes Colossæ. If the reading taken in <a href="/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a> is correct, Epaphras had been commissioned by St. Paul, and thus, indirectly, the Apostle might be held to be the founder of Colossæ. Accordingly this Letter stands, so to speak, midway between the unreserved familiarity of the Epistles to Corinth or Philippi, and the more formal reserve of the Epistle to the Romans.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/colossians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;...">Colossians 2:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">I would, </span>&c. — The apostle having declared, in the latter part of the preceding chapter, the commission which Christ had given to his apostles to preach salvation to the Gentiles through his death, and having described his own labours as an apostle in preaching that great blessing, and thereby having shown what great obligations mankind were under to him for communicating and perpetuating such interesting discoveries; he begins this second chapter with expressing an earnest desire that the Colossians knew what a great concern he was under for their establishment in grace, and that of others, to whom he had not personally ministered. <span class="ital">That ye knew what great conflict </span>— Of care, desire, prayer; <span class="ital">I have </span>— The original expression is taken from the athletic exercises of the Greeks, and expresses the great solicitude, or agony of mind, the apostle was in on their account. <span class="ital">For you </span>— Not only for the members of such churches as I myself have been the instrument of planting, and among whom I have exercised my ministry in person, but for those among whom I have not so ministered; <span class="ital">and for them at Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face, </span>&c. — For my concern for the spread of the gospel, and the salvation of the heathen, is influenced, not by considerations of personal friendship for those whom I particularly know and love, but by a benevolent regard for the good of mankind in general, known or unknown, that they may receive and retain this glorious revelation, and have it delivered to them with all possible advantage. It appears to have grieved the apostle to think how incapable he was rendered of serving them otherwise than by his letters and prayers. And should not this language inspire every minister who reads this, with an earnest desire to use his liberty to the best of purposes, and to exert himself as much as, under such confinement, he would wish he had done? <span class="ital">That their hearts may be comforted </span>— With the consolations of the Holy Ghost, and animated to every holy affection and beneficent action.

When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I would that ye knew - I wish you knew or fully understood. He supposes that this would deeply affect them if they understood the solicitude which he had had on their account.<p>What great conflict - Margin, fear, or care. The Greek word is "agony" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  ago&#772;na.

It properly refers to the combats, contests, struggles, efforts at the public games; the toil and conflict to obtain a victory. It refers here to the anxious care, the mental conflict, the earnest solicitude which he had in their behalf, in view of the dangers to which they were exposed from Judaizing Christians and Pagan philosophy. This mental struggle resembled that which the combatants had at the public games; compare the <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>, note, 27, note. And for them at Laodicea For Christians there, who were exposed to similar danger. Laodicea was the capital of Phrygia, in Asia Minor, and a little south of Colossae. See Introduction, Section 1. 6. Notes, <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>. There was a church early planted there - the "lukewarm" church mentioned in <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>. Being in the vicinity of Colossae, the church there would be exposed to the same perils, and the rebuke in <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, showed that the fears of Paul were well founded, and that the arts of the false teachers were too successful.<p>And for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh - That is, evidently in that region. He had, doubtless, a general solicitude for all Christians, but his remark here has reference to those in the neighborhood of the church at Colossae, or in that church. On the question which has been raised, whether this proves that the apostle Paul had never been at Colossae or Laodicea, see Introduction, Section 2, 4. This passage does not seem to me to prove that he had not been there. It may mean that he had great solicitude for those Christians there whom he knew, and for all others there, or in the vicinity, even though he was not personally acquainted with them. He may refer:<p>(1) to some churches in the neighborhood formed since he was there; or.<p>(2) to strangers who had come in there since he was with them; or.<p>(3) to those who had been converted since he was there, and with whom he had no personal acquaintance. For all these he would feel the same solicitude, for they were all exposed to the same danger. To "see one's face in the flesh," is a Hebraism, meaning to become personally acquainted with him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Col 2:1-23. His Strivings in Prayer for Their Steadfastness in Christ; from Whom He Warns Them Not to Be Led Away by False Wisdom.<p>1. For&#8212;He explains in what respect he "labored striving" (Col 1:29). Translate as Greek, "I wish you to know how great a conflict (the same Greek word as in Col 1:29, "agony of a conflict" of fervent, anxious prayer; not conflict with the false teachers, which would have been impossible for him now in prison) I have for you."<p>them at Laodicea&#8212;exposed to the same danger from false teachers as the Colossians (compare Col 4:16). This danger was probably the cause of his writing to Laodicea, as well as to Colosse.<p>not seen my face in the flesh&#8212;including those in Hierapolis (Col 4:13). Paul considered himself a "debtor" to all the Gentiles (Ro 1:14). "His face" and presence would have been a "comfort" (Col 2:2; Ac 20:38). Compare Col 1:4, 7, 8, in proof that he had not seen, but only heard of the Colossians. Hence he strives by earnest conflict with God in anxious prayer for them, to make up for the loss of his bodily presence among them.

Erroneous also is the view (held already by Theodoret in the <span class="ital">Hypothes</span>. and in the <span class="ital">Commentary</span>, though Credner, <span class="ital">Einl</span>. § 154, erroneously denies this) of Baronius, Lardner, and David Schultz (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

With how many of the latter were there no such dangers at all existing, as the Colossians and Laodiceans were exposed to! To this falls to be added the fact, that in the entire Epistle there is not a single hint of the apostle having been present in Colossae. See, on the contrary, on <a href="/colossians/1-8.htm" title=" Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.">Colossians 1:8</a> and on <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>.

See <a href="/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5</a>. The addition, which might in itself be dispensed with (comp. <a href="/galatians/1-22.htm" title="And was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:">Galatians 1:22</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>), serves the purpose of <span class="ital">concrete representation</span>, without its being necessary to import into it a contrast to the “spiritual <span class="ital">physiognomy</span>” (Olshausen), or to the having made acquaintance <span class="ital">in a spiritual fashion</span> (Hofmann), in connection with which Estius even discovers a certain <span class="greekheb">ταπείνωσις</span> through a higher estimation of the latter; although generally the idea of a <span class="ital">spiritual mode of intercourse</span>, independent of bodily absence, very naturally occasioned the concrete description: my <span class="ital">bodily</span> face.

More frequently the negative is used, <span class="greekheb">οὐ θέλω ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν</span>. <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> introduces the proof of what he has just said, by the illustration from the case of his readers, and thus prepares the way for the warning that follows in <a href="/colossians/2-4.htm" title=" And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.">Colossians 2:4</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγῶνα</span>: the inward struggle of Paul will embrace his prayers, his anxiety and his earnest meditation on the implications of the false teaching and the best manner of refuting it. Added to this are the difficulties caused by his imprisonment and the fact that the Colossians were personally unknown to him.—<span class="greekheb">Λαοδικίᾳ</span>. The members of this Church were probably exposed to the same dangers as their neighbours.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅσοι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. So far as the words themselves go, they may mean that the Colossians and Laodiceans did belong to the number of those who had not seen him or that they did not. But the latter alternative is very improbable, for Paul would not have joined a general reference to Churches unknown to him to a special mention of two Churches that were known to him. Further, Paul continues with <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, which refers to <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅσοι</span>, but must include the Colossians, since in <a href="/colossians/2-4.htm" title=" And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.">Colossians 2:4</a> he says, “This I say that no one may delude <span class="ital">you</span>”. This also corresponds to the use of <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅσοι</span> after an enumeration. The narrative in Acts favours this view, as does the absence of any hint in the Epistle that Paul had visited Colossæ. We may therefore safely assume with almost all commentators that the Apostle was personally unknown to both of these Churches.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>: to be taken with <span class="greekheb">τὸ πρ</span>· <span class="greekheb">μου</span>, not with <span class="greekheb">ἑόρ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="/context/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;...">Colossians 2:1-7</a>.

"I would have you know;" a familiar Pauline phrase (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>, etc.). <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("how great') has, perhaps, a slightly exclamatory force, as in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5</a> (only other instance of the word in the New Testament), and in classical Greek. For "strife," see note on "striving" (<a href="/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>): the energy and abruptness of language characterizing this second chapter bear witness in the inward wrestling which the Colossian difficulty occasioned in the apostle's mind. (On the close connection of Colossae with Laodicea, comp. <a href="/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13-17</a>, notes; also Introduction, &sect; 1.) The danger which had come to a head in Colassae was doubtless threatening its neighbours. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and as many as have not seen my face in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (ver. 5; <a href="/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>; <a href="/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>), raise the question whether St. Paul had ever visited Colossae. The language of <a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see note) raises a strong presumption against his being the founder of this Church, and the narrative of the Acts scarcely admits of any visit to this region in former missionary journeys. Theodoret amongst the Greeks, followed by our own Lardner and a few recent critics, contended that the apostle distinguishes here between Colossians and Laodiceans (or at least the former), and <span class="accented">those who had not seen His face.</span> But the disjunction is grammatically harsh and improbable (see Ellicott). (On the general question, see Introduction, &sect; 2.) The apostle is the more anxious for this endangered Church, as the gifts that his presence might have conveyed (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>) were wanting to them. He says, "in flesh," for "in spirit" he is closely united with them (ver. 5; <a href="/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>: comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>). The object of his <span class="accented">strife on their behalf</span> is - <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I would that ye knew (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Paul's more usual form of expression is, I would not have you to be ignorant.
