(Comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11</a>, “Ye who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh made with hands.”) The phrase “made without hands” is so constantly used of heavenly realities (as in <a href="/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm" title="But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>), as opposed to earthly symbols, that it comes to have the positive sense of “spiritual.” It is defined below as “the circumcision of Christ”—that which Christ has given us in Himself—in contradistinction to the old circumcision which is now “nothing.” (On the treatment of this subject in the Epistles of this period, comp. with this passage <a href="/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11-12</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2-3</a>, and see Notes there.)<p><span class= "bld">In putting off the body . . .</span>—The words “of the sins” are not found in the best MSS. They are, no doubt, an explanatory gloss to soften the harshness of the phrase “the body of the flesh.” (1) What “the body of the flesh” is we see clearly by <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>, “having put off the old man.” It is, like the “body of sin” (in <a href="/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>) and the “body of death” (in <a href="/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24</a>), the body so far as it is, in the bad sense of the word “flesh,” fleshly. The body itself is not “put off:” for it is not evil; it is a part of the true man, and becomes the temple of God. It is only so far as in it the flesh rebels against the spirit, and the “old man is gradually corrupted by the lusts of deceit” (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>), that it is to be “put off.” (2) But why the “body of the flesh,” and not the “flesh” simply? The answer is, no doubt, that which Chrysostom here gives, that the bodily circumcision was but of one member, in mere symbolism of one form of purity; the spiritual circumcision is the putting away of the whole of the power of the flesh, and that, too, not in symbol, but in reality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/colossians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:...">Colossians 2:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">In whom also ye are circumcised — </span>Ye have received the spiritual blessings signified of old by circumcision; <span class="ital">with the circumcision made without hands </span>— Namely, an internal, spiritual circumcision; <span class="ital">in putting off </span>— Not a little skin, but the whole <span class="ital">body of the sins of the flesh</span> — All the sins proceeding from your corrupt nature; <span class="ital">by the circumcision of Christ </span>— The circumcision of the heart, which Christ requires and effects. <span class="ital">Buried with him, </span>&c. — That is, which he wrought in you when you were, as it were, <span class="ital">buried with him in baptism — </span>The ancient manner of baptizing by immersion is as manifestly alluded to here, as the other manner of baptizing by sprinkling, or pouring of water, is, <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>.

But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In whom - In connection with whom, or in virtue of whose religion.<p>Ye are circumcised - You have received that which was designed to be represented by circumcision - the putting away of sin; Notes, <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>.<p>With the circumcision made without hands - That made in the heart by the renunciation of all sin. The Jewish teachers insisted on the necessity of the literal circumcision in order to salvation (compare <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>); and hence, this subject is so often introduced into the writings of Paul, and he is at so much pains to show that, by believing in Christ, all was obtained which was required in order to salvation. Circumcision was an ordinance by which it was denoted that all sin was to be cut off or renounced, and that he who was circumcised was to be devoted to God and to a holy life. All this, the apostle says, was obtained by the gospel; and, consequently they had all that was denoted by the ancient rite of circumcision. What Christians had obtained, moreover, related to the heart; it was not a mere ordinance pertaining to the flesh.<p>In putting off the body of the sins of the flesh - That is, in renouncing the deeds of the flesh, or becoming holy. The word "body," here, seems to be used with reference to circumcision. In that ordinance, the body of the FLesH was subjected to the rite; with Christians, it is the body of Sin that is cut off.<p>By the circumcision of Christ - Not by the fact that Christ was circumcised, but that we have that kind of circumcision which Christ established, to wit, the renouncing of sin. The idea of the apostle here seems to be, that since we have thus been enabled by Christ to renounce sin, and to devote ourselves to God, we should not, be induced by any plausible arguments to return to an ordinance pertaining to the flesh, as if that were needful for salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Implying that they did not need, as the Judaizers taught, the outward rite of circumcision, since they had already the inward spiritual reality of it.<p>are&#8212;rather, as the Greek, "Ye were (once for all) circumcised (spiritually, at your conversion and baptism, Ro 2:28, 29; Php 3:3) with a (so the Greek) circumcision made without hands"; opposed to "the circumcision in the flesh made by hands" (Eph 2:11). Christ's own body, by which the believer is sanctified, is said to be "not made with hands" (Mr 14:58; Heb 9:11; compare Da 2:45).<p>in putting off&#8212;rather as Greek, "in your putting off"; as an old garment (Eph 4:22); alluding to the putting off the foreskin in circumcision.<p>the body of the sins of the flesh&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "the body of the flesh," omitting "of the sins," that is, "the body," of which the prominent feature is fleshiness (compare Ro 8:13, where "flesh" and "the body" mutually correspond). This fleshly body, in its sinful aspect, is put off in baptism (where baptism answers its ideal) as the seal of regeneration where received in repentance and faith. In circumcision the foreskin only was put off; in Christian regeneration "the body of the flesh" is spiritually put off, at least it is so in its ideal conception, however imperfectly believers realize that ideal.<p>by&#8212;Greek, "in." This spiritual circumcision is realized in, or by, union with Christ, whose "circumcision," whereby He became responsible for us to keep the whole law, is imputed to believers for justification; and union with whom, in all His vicarious obedience, including His circumcision, is the source of our sanctification. Alford makes it explanatory of the previous, "a circumcision made without hands," namely, "the circumcision brought about by your union with Christ." The former view seems to me better to accord with Col 2:12; 3:1, 3, 4, which similarly makes the believer, by spiritual union with Christ, to have personal fellowship in the several states of Christ, namely, His death, resurrection, and appearing in glory. Nothing was done or suffered by our Mediator as such, but may be acted in our souls and represented in our spirits. Pearson's view, however, is that of Alford. Joshua, the type (not Moses in the wilderness), circumcised the Israelites in Canaan (Jos 5:2-9) the second time: the people that came out of Egypt having been circumcised, and afterwards having died in the wilderness; but those born after the Exodus not having been so. Jesus, the Antitype, is the author of the true circumcision, which is therefore called "the circumcision of Christ" (Ro 2:29). As Joshua was "Moses' minister," so Jesus, "minister of the circumcision for the truth of God" unto the Gentiles (Ro 15:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands:</span> he removes what they who are addicted to superstition might suggest, as if there were somewhat defective to a completeness in Christ, by showing there was no need of any addition to what he required in the gospel; for that they might most plausibly urge of circumcision, as being the seal of the old covenant, and an obligation to the whole law, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/5-3.htm" title="For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.">Galatians 5:3</a></span>, which some pressed as necessary to salvation, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.">Acts 15:1</a>,24</span>, he here shows was altogether needless now, that they were sanctified and had the thing signified by it, the circumcision of the heart, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/2-28.htm" title="For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:">Romans 2:28</a>,29 Php 3:3</span>, and were complete in Christ without it; yea, that the urging of that and other ceremonies now, was a pernicious error, tending to annihilate the cross of Christ, and overthrow the whole mystery of his grace.

This is said to prevent an objection that might be made to the perfection of these Gentile believers, because they were not circumcised; for the Jews thought that perfection lay in circumcision, at least that there could be no perfection without it: <p>"great is circumcision (say they (x)), for notwithstanding all the commands which Abraham our father did, he was not called perfect until he was circumcised; as it is written, <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; "walk before me, and be thou perfect:" <p>which objection the apostle anticipates, by observing, that they were circumcised in Christ their head, who is made unto them sanctification; and by him as the meritorious and efficient cause of their regeneration and conversion, or internal circumcision, the antitype and perfection of circumcision in the flesh; for the former, and not the latter, is here meant: these believers were circumcised in Christ, or by him; not with external circumcision, which was peculiar to the Jews, the natural seed of Abraham, prefigured Christ, and had its accomplishment in him, the body and substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law; and so was now nothing, either to Jew or Gentile: as for the Gentiles, they never were obliged unto it; and as for the Jews, it was an insupportable yoke to them, binding them to keep the whole law of Moses, which they could not do, and so it made nothing perfect; but Christ the substance of that, and the end of the whole law, has, the head of the body the church, in whom all the members of it are complete, and are circumcised: <p>with the circumcision made without hands: which is that of the heart, in the spirit; every man, though he may be circumcised in the flesh, is uncircumcised in heart, until he is circumcised by Christ and his Spirit; which is done, when he is pricked to the heart, and thoroughly convinced of sin, and the exceeding sinfulness of it; when the callousness and hardness of his heart is taken off and removed, and the iniquity of it is, laid open, the plague and corruption in it discerned, and all made naked and bare to the sinner's view; and when he is in pain on account of it, is broken and groans under a sense of it, and is filled with shame for it, and loathing and abhorrence of it: now this is effected not "by the hand of man", as the Ethiopic version reads it, as outward circumcision was; this is not done by any creature whatever; not by angels, who rejoice at the repentance of sinners, but cannot produce it; nor by ministers of the Gospel, who at most are but instruments of regeneration and conversion; nor by men themselves; this is not by might or power of man, by the strength of his free will, but by the Spirit of God: for though men are sometimes exhorted to circumcise themselves, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>, in order to convince them of the corruption of their nature, and the need they stand in of spiritual circumcision; yet whereas there is an utter disability in them to effect it, and they need the power and grace of God for that purpose, the Lord has graciously promised his people to do it himself for them, <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>; so that this circumcision is in the name sense made without hands, as the human nature of Christ is said to be a tabernacle not made with hands, that, is of men, but of God, being what God has pitched, and not man; and it stands opposed to circumcision in the flesh, which was made with hands, <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>; and by some instrument, as a sharp knife or stone: <p>in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh. The Vulgate Latin version leaves out the word "sins", and so the Alexandrian copy and some others; and the Syriac version the word "body": by "the flesh" is meant corrupt nature, which is born of the flesh, and propagated in a carnal way, and is the source and spring of all sin; by "the sins" of it are intended the works of the flesh, the inward motions of sin in the members, and the outward actions of it: these are said to be a "body", because sin consists of various parts and members, as a body does; and these united together, and which receive frequent and daily additions; and which are committed and yielded to by the members of the natural body; and which body and bulk of sins arising from the corruption of nature are compared to a garment, and a very filthy one it is; in the putting off of which lies spiritual circumcision: this is done several ways; partly by Christ's wrapping himself in the sins of his people, bearing them in his body, and becoming a sacrifice for them, whereby the old man was crucified, and the body of sin destroyed; and by an application of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, to the consciences of his people, whereby their iniquities are caused to pass from them, and they are clothed with change of raiment; and by the power of his Spirit, laying sin under the restraints of grace, not suffering it to have dominion, but causing grace to reign through righteousness; and by the saints themselves, under the influence of grace, who put off the old man with his deeds, according to the former conversation: <p>by the circumcision of Christ; not that with which Christ was circumcised at eight days old, that he might appear to be truly man, and a son of Abraham, and under the law, and to fulfil all the righteousness of it, but that which he by his Spirit is the author of, and what is before expressed, <p>(x) Misn.

But Christ is not conceived of as <span class="ital">Himself the circumciser</span>, in so far, namely, as by <span class="ital">baptism</span> (Theophylact, Beza, and others), or by His <span class="ital">Spirit</span> (Bleek), He accomplishes the cleansing and sanctification of man (see on <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>. The reference to circumcision seems to come in abruptly. But probably it stands in close connexion with what has gone before. For the return to the principalities and powers in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a> shows that Paul is not passing here to a new section of his subject. Judaism, of which circumcision was the most characteristic feature, was regarded as under angelic powers, and the removal of them meant its abolition. It seems probable that the false teachers set a high value on circumcision, and urged it on the Colossians, not as indispensable to salvation, in which case Paul would have definitely attacked them on this point, but as conferring a higher sanctity. There seems to be no suggestion that it was regarded as a charm against evil spirits. The Apostle does not merely leave them with the statement that they have been made full in Christ, which rendered circumcision unnecessary, but adds that they have already received circumcision, not material but spiritual, not the removal of a fragment of the body, but the complete putting off of the body of flesh.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καὶ περιετμήθητε</span>. A definite historical fact is referred to, as is shown by the aorist. This was their conversion, the inward circumcision of the heart, by which they entered on the blessings of the New Covenant. The outward sign of this is baptism, with which Paul connects it in the next verse. But it cannot be identified with it, for it is not made with hands. The circumcision of the heart is a prophetic idea (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm" title="Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm" title="Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;">Jeremiah 9:25</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/44-7.htm" title="In that you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.">Ezekiel 44:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-9.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.">Ezekiel 44:9</a>). In Paul it occurs <a href="/context/romans/2-28.htm" title="For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:...">Romans 2:28-29</a>, <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a>.—<span class="greekheb">περιτομῇ ἀχειροποιήτῳ</span>: “with 2 circumcision not wrought by hands,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, spiritual, ethical (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ λεγόμενοι ἀκροβυστία ὑπὸ τῆς λεγομένης περιτομῆς ἐν σαρκὶ χειροποιήτου</span>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός</span>: “in the stripping from you of the body of the flesh”. The expression <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σαρκὸς</span> is unusual. It means the body which consists of flesh, and of flesh as the seat of sin. By the removal of the home in which sin dwelt sin itself was removed. It is one of those cases in which the sense of <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> approximates to that of <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>. This body of flesh is removed from the Christian at his conversion.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>. This cannot be the circumcision endured by Christ in His infancy, for that was wrought by hands, and such a reference would be most unfortunate for the polemic against ceremonies and altogether un-Pauline. Usually it is explained as the circumcision of our hearts which comes from Christ. But this has no parallel in the N.T.; further, it practically repeats <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">περιετ</span>.; and, coming between the removal of the body of the flesh and the burial with Christ, breaks the connexion. Accordingly Schneckenburger (followed by Kl[13], Sod., Haupt) suggested that it was really an expression for the death of Christ. (His view that <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. was to be taken similarly has met with no acceptance.) In favour of this it may be said that in the immediate context Paul goes on to speak of burial and resurrection with Christ, and a reference to the death would naturally precede. And circumcision is a happy metaphor for Christ’s death to sin (<a href="/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a>). Meyer’s objection that it is inappropriate since Christ endured actual circumcision is not serious, for, if sound, it should have excluded the choice of these ambiguous words altogether, which naturally suggest a circumcision suffered by Christ. But what creates a grave difficulty is that the thought does not seem to run on connectedly. There is a transition from the death of Christ on the cross to the burial of Christians with Him in their own personal experience. Perhaps this interpretation involves taking <span class="greekheb">περιετμήθητε</span> of the death of Christians with Christ on the cross (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm" title="For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>), for it doubles the difficulty if Paul passes from the personal experience of the Christian to the cross, and from the cross back to personal experience. This suggests the possibility that <span class="greekheb">περ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. might be interpreted on the analogy of <span class="greekheb">θλίψεων τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>) as the circumcision of Christ in the believer. This would give a good connexion, and one that would suit the apparent identification of the circumcision of Christ with the putting off of the body of the flesh. The phrase, however, is so strange, and the idea that Christ dies with us so questionable (we die with Him), that it seems unsafe to adopt it. It is, therefore, best to mitigate the difficulty by the view that in these words Paul interpolates, in a concise and obscure expression, a reference to the great fact which underlay the spiritual experiences of which he is speaking. This circumcision, he would say, that is the removal of the flesh, was first experienced by Christ on the cross, and what happened to you ideally then is realised though union with Him now.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[13] Klöpper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">in whom</span>] The truth of the holy Union of members and Head is again in view.

No, surely, but that “inward and spiritual grace” of which Baptism is the sacramental Seal, “a death unto sin and a new birth unto righteousness” (Church Catechism). It is vital union with Christ, through faith, by the Holy Spirit (see <a href="/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>), viewed as our separation from the condemnation (<a href="/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>) and power (<span class="ital">ib</span>., 12, 13) of sin, and so our real entrance into a position of covenanted peace (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>) and a condition of covenanted grace. In both these aspects it is the Antitype of the type Circumcision, and the Reality under the seal Baptism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the putting off</span>] The Greek is one strong compound word; “<span class="ital">the entire stripping off</span>.” It was, in principle and as regarded the call and grace of God, <span class="ital">a total break</span> with the old position and condition; not a reform but a revolution of the man’s standing and state.—The physical imagery is drawn of course from the severe Abrahamic rite.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the body of the sins of the flesh</span>] Omit, on good evidence, the words “<span class="ital">of the sins</span>” which appear to be a (very intelligible) gloss or comment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What is “<span class="ital">the body of the flesh</span>”<span class="ital">?</span> Elsewhere in St Paul the word “<span class="ital">body</span>” appears never to mean anything but the physical frame, save in passages referring to the Church; but (in passages at all akin to this) it is that frame viewed as in some sense the vehicle of sin, or rather of temptation. Cp. <a href="/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="/romans/7-24.htm" title="O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?">Romans 7:24</a>; <a href="/context/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness....">Romans 8:10-11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a>. As God’s handiwork, the body is good, and on its way, in Christ, to glorification. As the body of man in the Fall, and as man’s means of contact with a sinful external world, if in no other way, it is so conversant with and affected by evil as to be (<span class="ital">in that respect</span>) an evil. As such it is “the body of the flesh,” that is, the body conditioned by, and reacting upon, our nature fallen and unregenerate.—See our notes on <a href="/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:4</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>, on the word “<span class="ital">flesh</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In Christ, “by the Spirit,” the Christian is empowered to “mortify the practices of the body” (<a href="/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a>). In Christ, “the body is for the Lord, <span class="ital">and the Lord for the body</span>” (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>). In this respect the man, while still liable to physical weakness and weariness, and truly capable of temptation, and as a fact never so using his “fulness” in Christ as to be wholly free (whatever his consciousness) from the burthen of evil in and through “the body of the flesh,” yet stands on such a ground of vantage over the power of that body as to find by faith a noble practical reality in the strong words of this verse.—See further, on the other hand, notes on <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the circumcision of Christ</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">in</span> &c.; “<span class="ital">as united to, interested in</span>.”—What is this circumcision? that given by Christ, or that undergone by Christ? Much may be said for the latter. Our Lord was “circumcised for man,” as the sacramental Seal of His “subjection to the law for man”; and so His historical Circumcision has a deep connexion with our possession, through Him, of acceptance and sanctification, the fruit of His Righteousness and Merits. But in this context the other reference is preferable.

For the distinction between &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; body and &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; flesh, see on flesh, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>, sec. 3.<p>In the circumcision of Christ (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>The spiritual circumcision effected through Christ. See <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>; <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>. In, as above. The fleshly circumcision removed only a portion of the body. In spiritual circumcision, through Christ, the whole corrupt, carnal nature is put away like a garment which is taken off and laid aside. </body></html>
