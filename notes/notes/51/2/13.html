The two passages should be read side by side. There is, as always, strong similarity, yet complete independence. Through the passage of the Ephesian Epistle there runs a two-fold idea, the reconcilement of Jew and Gentile to God, and the union of both in one Catholic Church. In this Epistle it is only on the reconcilement to God in Christ that stress is laid. Even the detailed expressions of the two passages illustrate each other at once by likeness and by variety.<p><span class= "bld">Dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh.</span>—See <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>, “You who were dead in trespasses and sins . . . who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision in the flesh.” Here the “deadness” is spoken of, as coming both from the actual power of “sins” (<span class= "ital">transgressions</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and from the alienation from God marked by uncircumcision. In the other passage the uncircumcision is looked upon only as a name of reproach.<p><span class= "bld">Hath he quickened.</span>—It is difficult to determine what is the subject in this sentence. According to all analogy it should be “God,” yet in the latter clauses (as in <a href="/context/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14-15</a>) it must surely be “Christ.” Now, when we turn to the fuller parallel passage, we see an overt change of subject. It is said (<a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>), “God quickened us together with Christ”; “God in Christ forgave us” (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>); but “Christ abolished the Law,” “reconciled us to God on the cross.” This suggests a similar change of subject here also, which must be at the words “and took it away,” or (for the tense here is changed) “and He (Christ) hath taken it away.” This, speaking grammatically, introduces an anomaly; but such anomalies are not uncommon in St. Paul, especially in passages of high spiritual teaching.<p><span class= "bld">Having forgiven you . . .</span>—There is no corresponding clause in the parallel passage; but in a different context (corresponding to <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm" title=" Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.">Colossians 3:13</a> of this Epistle) we read, “forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you” (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/colossians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;...">Colossians 2:13-15</a></span>. <span class="ital">And you </span>— Believing Gentiles; <span class="ital">being </span>formerly <span class="ital">dead in your sins </span>— Under the guilt and power of your sins, (see on <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>,) <span class="ital">and the uncircumcision of your flesh </span>— Your corrupt and unrenewed nature, your uncircumcised heart and affections; <span class="ital">hath he </span>— God the Father; <span class="ital">quickened — </span>Brought you out of that state by infusing into you spiritual life: <span class="ital">together with him </span>— Through the merit of Christ’s death, and in conformity to his resurrection; <span class="ital">having forgiven you all trespasses </span>— In consequence of his having atoned for them. <span class="ital">Blotting out the handwriting</span> — Where a debt is contracted, it is usually testified by some handwriting. And when the debt is forgiven, the handwriting is destroyed, either by blotting it out, taking it away, or tearing it. The apostle expresses in all these three ways God’s destroying <span class="ital">the handwriting which was contrary to us. </span>And perhaps, as Macknight thinks, in the expression, <span class="ital">nailing it to the cross, </span>he alludes to “an ancient custom of abrogating laws, by driving a nail through the tables on which they were written, and hung up to public view.” The word <span class="greekheb">δογματα</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">ordinances, </span>is used by the LXX., <a href="/ezekiel/20-26.htm" title="And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 20:26</a>, for the rites of the ceremonial law, as it is also <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, and that law is evidently here meant. St. Paul says, <span class="ital">it was against us; </span>meaning, 1st, The Jews, who had been under an obligation to fulfil it, and whose guilt and liableness to punishment it testified. It was also, 2d, Against and contrary to the Gentiles, as being a middle wall of partition, hindering them from coming to God, and putting an enmity between them and the Jews. This Christ took away by abolishing the obligation of it, and admitting the believing Gentiles to be fellow-heirs with the believing Jews, of the promises and blessings of the gospel, without their becoming subject to it. See notes on <a href="/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;...">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>. <span class="ital">And having spoiled principalities and powers </span>— The evil angels, of their usurped dominion, in consequence of his having conquered them. For in the original expression, <span class="greekheb">απεκδυσαμενος</span>, which signifies <span class="ital">having stripped off, </span>there is an allusion to the ancient custom of victors, who were wont to strip the vanquished of their arms and clothes. Hence the word is taken to signify spoiling in general. That the evil angels are here said to be spoiled by Christ’s dying on the cross, seems evident from what we read elsewhere. Christ, speaking of his death, said to his disciples, (<a href="/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>,) <span class="ital">Now shall, </span><span class="greekheb">ο αρχων</span>, <span class="ital">the prince, </span>or <span class="ital">ruler, of this world be cast out; </span>and, <a href="/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">ο αρχων</span>, <span class="ital">the prince of this world is judged. </span>See also <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>. And by <span class="ital">spoiling </span>them we may understand, with Hammond, Whitby, and others, the destruction of idolatry, the silencing the heathen oracles, and the banishing of those grievous superstitions, with which mankind had been so long oppressed. Some others, however, by these principalities and powers understand the Jewish rulers and great men, who in the first age grievously persecuted the disciples of Christ. But this interpretation seems unnatural, and certainly was not verified by fact at the time when the apostle wrote this epistle, the Jewish sanhedrim and rulers being still in power. <span class="ital">He </span>— God the Father; <span class="ital">made a show of them openly </span>— Before all the hosts of hell and heaven; <span class="ital">triumphing over them in </span>or by <span class="ital">it </span>— Even that cross whereby they hoped to have triumphed over him, God turning their counsels against themselves, and ruining their empire by that death of his Son which they had been so eager to accomplish. Or the clause may be rendered, <span class="ital">triumphing over them in him; </span>in Christ. By turning the heathen from the power of Satan to God, it was shown that the evil spirits, who formerly ruled them, were vanquished and stripped of their power. It is supposed, that in this and the preceding clause there is an allusion to the Roman triumphs, of which see on <a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>; and that St. Paul represents Christ himself, or his apostles, as riding in triumph through the world, with the evil spirits following the triumphant car in chains, and exposed to public view as vanquished enemies.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And you, being dead in your sins - Notes, <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>.<p>And the uncircumcision of your flesh - That is, Gentiles, and giving unrestrained indulgence to the desires of the flesh.

Not corporeally, though sin had subjected them to a corporeal death, and their bodies were really mortal, and in a little time must die; but morally, sin had brought a death upon them in a moral sense, they were separated from God, as at death the body is from the soul, and so were alienated from the life of God, and consequently must be dead; they had lost the image of God, which consisted in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness; and were dead as to the understanding of what was good, as to their affections for it, or will and capacity to do it; and, like dead men, were insensible of their state, their sin, and misery; and altogether inactive and helpless in spiritual things, being destitute of spiritual life, strength, and motion; and were moreover in themselves deserving of eternal death, and according to the law of works, under the sentence of it, and so liable and exposed unto it; and all this for, and on account of their sins, their actual sins and transgressions here meant; which separated them from God, deformed his image in them, and hardened their hearts, that they had no true sight and sense of themselves; as also on account of the corruption of their nature, signified in the next clause: <p>and the uncircumcision of your flesh; which is to be taken not literally, for the prepuce, or foreskin of their flesh, which was a sign and token of the corruption of nature, but figuratively that itself; it being usual with the Jews to call the vitiosity of nature  "uncircumcision"; which, they say (y), is one of the seven names of , "the evil imagination", or corrupt nature, denoting the pollution, loathsomeness, and abominableness of it: <p>hath he quickened together with him; that is, with Christ; this may be understood either of the quickening of them in conversion and sanctification; for as they were dead in sin in a moral sense, in conversion a principle of life was implanted in them, or grace, as a living principle, was wrought in their souls by the Spirit of life from Christ; so that they could see their lost state, their need of Christ, the glory of his person and righteousness, the fulness and suitableness of his grace; feel their burdens, and handle the word of life; could hear the Gospel, speak the language of Canaan, breathe in prayer and spiritual desires, walk in Christ, and do all things through him; and this was God's act and not theirs, and owing to his rich mercy and great love: and this may be said to be done "with Christ", because this is in consequence of his being quickened, or raised from the dead; and by it they were made partakers of the life of Christ, they became one spirit with him; and it was not so much they that lived, but Christ lived in them; and besides, they were quickened, in order to live a life of grace and communion with him here, and of glory hereafter: or it may be interpreted of the quickening of them in justification; and the rather, because of what is said in the next clause; and that either openly, as when a sinner is convinced that he is dead in a legal sense, and faith is wrought in him to behold pardon and righteousness in Christ; upon which he prays for the one, and pleads the other; and the Spirit of God seals unto him the pardon of his sins, brings near the righteousness of Christ, enables him to lay hold on it as his, and pronounces him justified by it; and may well be called justification of life, for he is then alive in a legal sense, in his own comfortable view and apprehension of things: or secretly in Christ, as the head and representative of all his people; who when he was quickened, they were quickened with him; when he rose from the dead, they rose with him; and when he was justified, they were instilled in him, and this seems to be the true sense of this passage: <p>having forgiven you all trespasses. This was a past act, being done and over; not only at first conversion, when a discovery of it was made, but at the death of Christ, whose blood was shed for the remission of sin; yea, even as early as Christ became a surety, when the sins of his people were not imputed to them, but to him: and this was a single act, and done and complete at once; forgiveness of sin is not done by piecemeals, or at different times, or by divers acts, but is done at once, and includes sin past, present, and to come; and is universal, reaches to all sin, original and actual, before and after conversion; sins of thought, word, and action: and this is God's act, and his only; not men, nor ministers, nor angels, can forgive sin; this is the peculiar prerogative of God, and is owing to his abundant mercy and free grace, and which is signified by the word here used. The Syriac and Arabic versions read, "having forgiven us all our trespasses"; and so the Alexandrian copy, and some others, read "us" instead of "you", <p>(y) Zohar in Exod. fol. 106. 1.

The correctness of this reference is shown by the context as well through <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>., as through the pronoun of the <span class="ital">first</span> person which is introduced after <span class="greekheb">χαρισάμ</span>.

Grotius: “sicut Christo novam contulit vitam ex morte corporis, ita et nobis novam <span class="ital">ex morte animorum;</span>” comp. also Bleek and Hofmann), but in its <span class="ital">proper</span> sense, and that (comp. Kaeuffer, <span class="ital">de</span> <span class="greekheb">ζωῆς αἰων</span>. not. p. 94 f.) as referring to the <span class="ital">everlasting life</span> to which God[102] raised up Christ, and which He has thereby also provided for believers in virtue of their fellowship with Christ (as an ideal possession now, but to be realized at the Parousia). See also <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>. The <span class="ital">reconciliation</span> (which de Wette understands) is not the <span class="greekheb">ζωοποίησις</span> itself, as is plain from the compound <span class="greekheb">συνεζωοπ</span>., but its precursor and medium. The <span class="greekheb">συζωοποιεῖν</span> stands in the same relation to the <span class="greekheb">συνεγείρειν</span> as the nature of the act to its process; but the reason why <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθ</span>. here stands <span class="ital">before</span> the <span class="greekheb">συζωοποιεῖν</span> (it is different in <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>) is, that the <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθητε</span> was correlative with the <span class="greekheb">συνταφέντες</span> in <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>, hence that word is used first, while in Eph. <span class="ital">l.c</span>. the being dead preceded, with which the <span class="greekheb">συζωοποιεῖν</span> primarily corresponds. (2) Like <span class="greekheb">συνεζωοπ</span>., so also <span class="greekheb">νεκρούς</span> is not to be taken in an ethical sense (so usually both here and in <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>, as <span class="ital">e.g</span>. Calvin, who thinks that the <span class="ital">alienatio a Deo</span> is meant), but, with Chrysostom and Theodoret, in its <span class="ital">proper</span> sense; the readers have been—this is the conception—prior to their conversion to Christ a prey of <span class="ital">death</span>. This is by no means to be understood, however, in the sense of <span class="ital">physical</span> death (for that comes from <span class="ital">Adam’s</span> sin, see on <a href="/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>), but in that of <span class="ital">eternal</span> death, to which they were liable through their sins, so that they could not have become partakers of the eternal <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span> (comp. on <a href="/romans/7-9.htm" title="For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.">Romans 7:9</a> f.). See also on <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>. What is meant, therefore, is not a death which <span class="ital">would have only become their eternal death</span> in the absence of the quickening (Hofmann), but <span class="ital">the eternal death itself</span>, in which they <span class="ital">already lay</span>, and <span class="ital">out of which</span> they would not have come without that deliverance, nay, which on the contrary—and here we have a prolepsis of the thought—would only have <span class="ital">completed</span> itself in the future <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span>.[103] (3) This being dead occurred <span class="ital">in the state</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>) <span class="ital">of their sins</span> (<span class="greekheb">τοῖς</span> indicates the sins which they had committed) <span class="ital">and of the uncircumcision of their flesh, i.e</span>. when as respects <span class="ital">their sinful materially-psychical nature</span> they were still uncircumcised, and had not yet put off by conversion their Gentile <span class="ital">fleshly</span> constitution.[104] The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΡΟΒΥΣΤΊΑ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">in itself</span> they even now had as Gentile Christians, but according to <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a> it was no longer <span class="greekheb">ἀκρόβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς σαρκός</span> in their case, but was now <span class="ital">indifferent</span> (<a href="/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>), since they had been provided with the ethical circumcision of Christ and emptied of the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τῆς σαρκός</span>. The ethical reference of the expression does not lie, therefore, in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΡΟΒΥΣΤΊΑ</span></span></span> itself, but in the characteristic <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΣΑΡΚῸς ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span> (genitive of the <span class="ital">subject</span>); in <span class="ital">this</span> uncircumcision they were <span class="ital">as Gentiles</span> prior to their conversion, but were so no longer <span class="ital">as Christians</span>.

Hofmann), or the like; on the contrary, the entire ethical stress lies on <span class="greekheb">τῆς σαρκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. The idea of <span class="ital">original sin</span> (Flacius and other dogmatic expositors, comp. Bengel: “<span class="ital">exquisita</span> appellatio peccati origin.”) is likewise involved, and that according to its N. T. meaning (<a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a> ff.), not in <span class="greekheb">ἀκροβυστ</span>., but doubtless in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΣΑΡΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>.

Otherwise we should have, quite unnecessarily, two references heterogeneous in sense for the genitive; besides, the notion of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΠΤΩΜΑ</span></span></span> presupposes not the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΆΡΞ</span></span></span>, but the <span class="ital">Ego</span> in its relation to the divine law as the subject; hence also the expression <span class="greekheb">παράπτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς σαρκ</span>.

Frequently this is taken to mean “you also,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, you Gentiles. But since Paul has been using the second person before, he can hardly be introducing a contrast. We should therefore take <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> as simply copulative. It means “you as well as Christ,” as is shown also by the verbal parallel between <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">νεκροὺς ὄντας</span>.—<span class="greekheb">νεκροὺς</span>. Here Paul varies the sense of death. In the preceding verses it is death to the old life, here the old life itself is described as a condition of spiritual death. It is not of liability to eternal death (Mey.), or to physical death as the certain consequence of sin that he is speaking, but of a state of actual death, which can only be spiritual (<span class="ital">cf.</span> “sin revived and I died,” <a href="/romans/7-9.htm" title="For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.">Romans 7:9</a>).—<span class="greekheb">τοῖς παραπτώμασιν</span>: “by your trespasses”. The dative is probably one of Cause, but it could be translated by “in”. <span class="greekheb">παραπτ</span>. are individual acts of transgression, of which <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> is the principle.—<span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ της σαρκὸς ὑμῶν</span>: “by the uncircumcision of your flesh”. This is often supposed to refer to literal uncircumcision, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to the fact that they were Gentiles. But we have already seen that there is no emphasis on this fact. And the implied contrast that Jews were not, while Gentiles were, spiritually dead, is impossible in Paul. He cannot have said that they were dead by reason of uncircumcision, and, if the dative is taken otherwise, yet the coupling of <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀκρ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παραπτ</span>. shows that physical uncircumcision is not referred to, but an ethical state. And this would not, as Abbott thinks, be unintelligible to Gentile readers, for he had already explained the metaphor in <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σαρκὸς</span> is accordingly to be taken as an epexegetical genitive, “the uncircumcision which consisted in your flesh”.—<span class="greekheb">συνεζωοποίησεν</span>: to be taken in the same sense as <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθητε</span>, not in any of the senses wrongly attributed to that word, which are reintroduced here. Chrysostom (followed by Ew., Ell.) makes Christ the subject. This is defended by Ellicott on the ground of the prominence of Christ through the passage, of the difficulty of supplying <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> from <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, and of referring the acts in <a href="/context/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;...">Colossians 2:14-15</a> to the Father. But this last difficulty, urged also by Lightfoot, rests on a probably wrong interpretation of <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>. Neither of the others is of any weight against the argument from Pauline usage, which always refers such actions to God. This view would also involve the awkwardness of making Christ raise Himself and us with Him, whereas in <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a> His resurrection is referred to God.

Forgiveness is contemporary with quickening.—<span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span>: the change from the second person may be due to Paul’s wish gratefully to acknowledge his own participation in this blessing.

The false teachers probably stigmatized the uncircumcised state as unholy. The apostle adopts the expression, but refers it to the pre-Christian life of his readers (see vers. 11, 12), when their Gentile uncircumcision was a true type of their moral condition (<a href="/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>).
