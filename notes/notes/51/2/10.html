But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And ye are complete in him - Having no need, for the purposes of salvation, of any aid to be derived from the philosophy of the Greeks, or the traditions of the Jews. All that is necessary to secure your salvation is to be found in the Lord Jesus. There is a completion, or a filling up, in him, so as to leave nothing wanting. This is true in respect:<p>(1) to the wisdom which is needful to guide us;<p>(2) the atonement to be made for sin;<p>(3) the merit by which a sinner can be justified; and,<p>(4) the grace which is needful to sustain us in the trials, and to aid us in the duties, of life; compare the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>.<p>There is no necessity, therefore, that we should look to the aid of philosophy, as if there was a defect in the teachings of the Saviour; or to human strength, as if he were unable to save us; or to the merits of the saints, as if those of the Redeemer were not sufficient to meet all our wants.

But, while this important thought would neither have motive nor be appropriate as a mere parenthesis, it would also be improper that the neuter subject <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΕΌΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> should be designated as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΚΕΦΑΛῊ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, which applies rather to the personal possessor of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ</span></span></span>, to Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[94] Calovius has well said: “Beneficium Christi, non nostrum officium;” comp. Wolf. In complete opposition to the context, Grotius brings out the sense: <span class="ital">“illo contenti estote,”</span> which he supports by the remark: “quia quod plenum est, nihil aliud desiderat.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[95] Inasmuch as he takes <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστιν</span> directly as <span class="ital">scilicet, utpote,</span> and regards this usage as a linguistic peculiarity of this Epistle. But this rendering is not required either in <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a> or in <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>; and respecting <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>, see the critical remarks.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐστὲ ἐν αὐτῷ πεπληρωμένοι</span>. This still depends on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστὲ</span> is obviously not an imperative. We should, perhaps, reject the view of Ellicott and Lightfoot that there are two predicates. The thoughts thus obtained that they are in Him, and that they are made full, are true in themselves. But, as Abbott points out, the context requires the emphasis to be thrown on the <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>, so that the sense is “and it is in Him that ye are made full”. <span class="greekheb">πεπλ</span>. is chosen on account of <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> in <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>, but we cannot explain it as filled with the Godhead, because such an equalising of Christians with their Lord would have been impossible to Paul, and would have required <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span> to express it. This meets Oltramare’s objection to the translation adopted. He says that if <span class="greekheb">πεπλ</span>. means filled, they must be filled with something, but since the most obvious explanation that they are filled with the fulness of the Godhead is so largely rejected, it is clear that the translation breaks down. He translates “in Him you are perfect,” and urges that this also overthrows the usual interpretation of <span class="greekheb">πλήρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεότ</span>. But apart from the fact that <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> does not mean moral perfection, <span class="greekheb">τῆς θεότ</span>. cannot be supplied. What Paul means is that in Christ they find the satisfaction of every spiritual want. It therefore follows of itself that they do not need the angelic powers.—<span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλὴ πάσης ἀρχῆς καί ἐξουσίας</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>. That Christ is the Head of every principality and power is a further reason why they should not seek to them. All they need they have in Christ. Paul does not mention here the thrones or lordships as in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>. But it is a questionable inference that they, unlike the principalities and powers, had no place in the false teaching.

The Colossians were being taught to replace or supplement Christ's offices by those of angel powers (see notes, vers. 15, 18). Philo ('Concerning Dreams,' 1. &sect;&sect; 22, 23) writes thus of the angels: "Free from all bodily encumbrance, endowed with larger and diviner intellect, they are lieutenants of the All ruler, eyes and ears of the great King.

In such a strain the Colossian "philosopher" may have been talking.
