and (as in <a href="/context/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11-17</a>) that the use of them may have been suggested by St. Paul’s captivity under military guard. If both words be referred to their “faith,” the Apostle obviously characterises it as having right “order” (or, <span class= "ital">harmony</span>) in its various parts, and a strong “solidity” against all trials.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit - That is, I seem to see you; I feel as if I were there, and were looking upon you; and I have the same solicitude as if I were there, and saw all the danger which exists that your beautiful order and harmony should be disturbed by the influence of false philosophy; see the notes at <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>. The word "spirit," here, does not refer to the Holy Spirit, or to any inspiration by which the apostle was enabled to see them; but it is equivalent to what we mean when we say, "My heart is with you." He seemed to be beholding them.<p>Joying and beholding your order - That is, I rejoice as if I saw your order.

As "order" expresses the outward aspect of the Church; so "steadfastness" expresses the inner basis on which their Church rested. The Greek literally implies not an abstract quality, but the thing in the concrete; thus their "faith" here is the solid thing which constituted the basis of their Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For though I be absent in in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit:</span> to prevent any surmise that his distance at Rome might take him off from minding of them at Colosse, he shows that the great affection he bare to them did oblige him to interest himself in all their concerns, (<span class="ital">the care of all the churches</span> being incumbent on him, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm" title="Beside those things that are without, that which comes on me daily, the care of all the churches.">2 Corinthians 11:28</a></span>), and therefore that his bodily confinement at Rome did not hinder his presence with them in spirit.

Or body, as the Ethiopic version reads it, and as it is expressed in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>; here the apostle anticipates an objection which might be made, how he could have such a conflict and concern for them, and express so much affection for them, and know so much of their affairs, in what condition and situation they were, and how liable to be deceived by false teachers, when he was absent from them, and had never been among them. That he had never been corporeally present with them, nor was he then, he owns; but this did not hinder but that he might be in another sense present with them, and so have cognizance of them and their state, and be affected towards them, and concerned for them: <p>yet am I with you in the spirit; as he was with the Corinthians in the place above cited, judging the incestuous person, determining concerning his case, and delivering him up to Satan, and so he was with these Colossians; for as he was a member of the same body with them, he was actuated by the same spirit; and by virtue of their union to each other in their common head, his spirit went out towards them, his heart was knit unto them; he had the same affection for them, and care of them, though he had never seen them with his bodily eyes, as he had for those whom he had seen: moreover, this may regard that extraordinary discerning and presence of his spirit which he had; and which was of the same kind with that of Elisha, when his servant Gehazi went after Naaman the Syrian, and took a present of him, to whom on his return he said, upon his denying that he had been anywhere, "went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?" <a href="/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a>. Elisha's spirit went, and was present with him, and saw and knew all that passed, being under the impulse and inspiration of the Spirit of God, who made all known unto him: so the spirit of the Apostle Paul was at the church at Colosse, and saw: and discerned their whole estate; this being made known by the Spirit of God, under whose inspiration he wrote this letter, suitable to their case: <p>joying and beholding your order; or as the Syriac version renders it, "I rejoice that I can see your order": that is, with pleasure observe, consider it, and contemplate on it; and that partly from the relation of Epaphras, and chiefly from the intimations of the Spirit of God in an extraordinary way: by their "order" is meant, either their orderly walk and conversation, which being as becomes the Gospel of Christ, was very pleasing and delightful to the apostle; or rather the order of their church discipline, they having regular officers, pastors, and deacons, ordained among them; who rightly performed their offices, and had respect and subjection yielded to them; the ordinances of the Gospel were duly administered, and constantly attended on; the members of the church were watched over, admonitions given, and censures laid where they were necessary, and everything was done decently and in order; which was a beautiful sight, and gave the apostle an uncommon pleasure. The word used signifies a military order, such as is observed in armies, in battle array; suggesting, that these Christians were good soldiers of Christ, were enlisted under his banners, and kept in due order, in rank and file; stood fast in one spirit, contended and strove together for the faith of the Gospel, fought the good fight of faith, nor could any hardship move them from their station; so that they were, in the apostle's eye, beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, and terrible as an army with banners, Sol 6:4; and so may denote their attachment to the Gospel, and to one another; they were united to, and abode by each other; they served the Lord with one consent, and kept the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace, <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>, which is a pleasant thing to behold, as well as what follows, <p>and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ; either in the grace of faith, and the exercise of it on Christ, in opposition to doubtings and unbelief; whereby God is honoured, and with which he is well pleased; souls are filled with peace and joy; Satan is resisted and overcome; and the hearts of others, particularly ministers of the Gospel, are comforted: or in the doctrine of faith respecting Christ, in which they stood fast; notwithstanding there was a majority against it, the wise and learned, the rich and mighty, did not receive it; and though it was opposed by false teachers, persecuted by profane men, and loaded with reproach and obloquy; and also in the profession of it, which they held without wavering: now to see a set of Christians, a church of Christ walking together in Gospel order, steady in their faith on Christ, abiding by the doctrine of faith, and maintaining an honourable profession, how beautiful and delightful is it! <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> order, and the stedfastness of your <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> faith in Christ.</span><p>(f) The manner of your ecclesiastical discipline.<p>(g) Doctrine.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5</a>.

Some erroneously cite Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell</span>. iii. 10. 2, where <span class="greekheb">χαίρω καὶ βλέπων</span> (not <span class="greekheb">βλέπω</span>) means: I rejoice, when I even see it. Winer, p. 438 [E. T. 589], and Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom</span>. II. p. 425, supply with <span class="greekheb">χαίρων</span> the words: <span class="ital">concerning you</span>.

IV. p. 245) of the <span class="ital">army</span>, sometimes to designate a <span class="ital">section</span> of it (a company of two <span class="greekheb">λόχοι</span>), and sometimes to express its regular <span class="ital">arrangement in rank and file</span> (Thuc. iii. 87. 2, iv. 72. 2, 126. 4, viii. 69. 1). Hofmann[83] takes both <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΆΞ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΕΡΈΩΜΑ</span></span></span> in a military sense. But the two words have not in and of themselves the military sense; they would receive it from the context, which is not the case here. Moreover, the meaning <span class="ital">fortress, military bulwark</span>, is expressed not by <span class="greekheb">στερέωμα</span> generally, but by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΡΥΜΑ</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΧΎΡΩΝΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>. Hence, if we would avoid arbitrariness, we can only abide by the view that here <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΆΞΙς</span></span></span> means the <span class="ital">orderly state of the Christian church</span>, which has hitherto not been disturbed by sectarian divisions or forsaken by the readers. Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm" title="Let all things be done decently and in order.">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>. To this <span class="ital">outward</span> condition Paul then subjoins the <span class="ital">inner</span> one, by which the former is conditioned: <span class="ital">and the solid hold of your faith in Christ. <span class="greekheb">στερέωμα</span>, firmamentum</span>, that which has been <span class="ital">made firm</span> (Arist. <span class="ital">partt. an</span>. ii. 9; Theophr. <span class="ital">H. pl</span>. v. 7. 3), a late word, often found in LXX., Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus, and Apocrypha (see Schleusner, <span class="ital">Thes</span>. V. p. 102 f.), represents the stedfastness and immoveableness of faith in such a way, that the latter appears as protected by a strong work (with solid foundation, masonry, etc.) from injury (<a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm" title="You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/18-2.htm" title="The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower....">Psalm 18:2; Psalms 3</a> Esdr. 8:81). On the subject-matter, comp. <a href="/acts/16-5.htm" title="And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.">Acts 16:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐστερεοῦντο τῇ πίστει</span>, <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm" title="Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.">1 Peter 5:9</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤΊΣΤΗΤΕ ΣΤΕΡΕΟῚ Τῇ ΠΊΣΤΕΙ</span></span></span>. The abstract <span class="ital">firmness</span>, however (Huther, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Bleek, and older expositors), which would be <span class="greekheb">στερεότης</span>, is never designated by the word. Chrysostom explains rightly: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΕ ΠΟΛΛᾺ ΣΥΝΑΓΑΓῺΝ ΣΥΓΚΟΛΛΉΣΕΙς ΠΥΚΝῶς ΚΑῚ ἈΔΙΑΣΠΑΣΤῶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤΌΤΕ ΣΤΕΡΈΩΜΑ ΓΊΝΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span>. The <span class="ital">genitive</span> <span class="greekheb">τῆς πίστεως</span>, finally, is not to be taken in such a way as <span class="ital">to make</span> faith the <span class="greekheb">στερέωμα</span> (Hofmann), which protects the readers, as if it were <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ὙΜῶΝ ΣΤΕΡΈΩΜΑ</span></span></span>; but as the genitive of the <span class="ital">subject</span>, in such a way that their faith <span class="ital">has</span> the <span class="greekheb">στερέωμα</span> securing it, which Paul spiritually sees.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To <span class="ital">call in question</span> the <span class="ital">unseducedness</span> here attested (Baumgarten-Crusius, who leaves it a question whether the sense is not merely: “<span class="ital">if</span> it is so”), or to refer it to only a <span class="ital">part</span> of the church (Flatt), is a quite arbitrary result of unduly pressing the general utterance of commendation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[83] Whom Holtzmann, p. 177, has too rashly followed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> is difficult. Meyer thinks that the fact of his spiritual presence is mentioned, in contrast to his bodily absence, as a reason why they should not let themselves be deceived. Ellicott (after Chrysostom) thinks that he is explaining why he can advise them, it is because he thus knows their need. Lightfoot, Soden, Findlay and Haupt think he explains his warning by his personal interest in them.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> goes closely with <span class="greekheb">τῇ σαρκὶ</span>. The dative is one of reference, and <span class="greekheb">τῇ σαρκὶ</span> is equivalent to “in the body”. There is not the least ground for the inference that Paul had ever been to Colossæ.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ πνεύματι</span>: not “by the Holy Spirit,” but “in spirit”. Paul’s own spirit is meant as in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,...">1 Corinthians 5:3-4</a>.—<span class="greekheb">σῦν ὑμῖν εἰμί</span>: not simply among you, but “united with you through the warmest community of interest” (Sod.).—<span class="greekheb">χαίρων καὶ βλέπων</span>. Many take this as if it were equivalent to “rejoicing to see,” but it is questionable if the words can mean this. If the object of his joy is the condition of the Church, we should have expected an inversion of the order, first seeing and then rejoicing at what he saw. Lightfoot explains the order as indicating that he looked because it gave him joy to look. Ellicott assumes a continuation of the words <span class="greekheb">σῦν ὑμῖν</span>, “rejoicing with you and beholding”. Meyer thinks <span class="greekheb">χαίρων</span> means rejoicing to be thus present with you in spirit. It is very difficult to decide as to the meaning, possibly Ellicott’s view is best.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν τάξιν καὶ τὸ στερέωμα</span>. A military sense is often found in both of these nouns, though sometimes (as by Ol.) it is restricted to the latter. Meyer and Abbott deny the military reference altogether. Both words are used in a military sense, but this is suggested by the context, and it is said that “here the context suggests nothing of the kind” (Abb.). Haupt decides for it on the ground of the connexion. If the terms had been general, Paul would not have placed his joy over their order before his mention of their faith. But in representing them as a well-ordered army, and then expressing the same idea under the image of a bulwark which consists in their faith, the order is correct. It is, however, very questionable if an argument from order of this kind is to be pressed. Lightfoot translates <span class="greekheb">στερέωμα</span> “solid front”. It may have simply the sense of firm foundation. Whatever the precise force of the words, it is clear that the Church as a whole remained true to the doctrine it had been taught.—<span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/acts/16-5.htm" title="And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.">Acts 16:5</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm" title="Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.">1 Peter 5:9</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>] He means that he knows the need of such warning, though he is so far away. He is close to them “<span class="ital">in spirit</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the spirit</span>] Is this the human spirit or the Divine? <a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Corinthians 5:4</a> (with 3) appears to decide for the former. It is scarcely enough to say (as Lightfoot) that this is “the common antithesis of flesh and spirit, or body and spirit;” for in many important passages (e.g. <a href="/context/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh....">Galatians 5:16-18</a>) the antithesis to “<span class="ital">the flesh</span>” is precisely the Divine Spirit dwelling in the man. And here the meaning might well be (cp. <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven....">2 Corinthians 12:2-3</a>) that in some way supernatural the Holy Spirit gave him, in spite of bodily absence, a mysterious presence of intuitive consciousness. But the tone of the context is in favour of a simpler meaning; and “<span class="ital">flesh</span>,” here used evidently in its most literal sense, points the same way. And so the words “<span class="ital">my spirit</span>” (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>) present a true parallel and explanation; though even there a certain mystery seems to be indicated. He is <span class="ital">present</span> in the sense of spiritual love and influence.—Jerome compares Elisha and Gehazi (<a href="/2_kings/5-26.htm" title="And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?">2 Kings 5:26</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">joying and beholding</span>] The “<span class="ital">joy</span>” of what he hears of them leads him more vividly to “<span class="ital">behold</span>” them, as if in actual view.—Observe his loving wish to dwell even here on their brighter side.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">order … stedfastness</span>] Both words are military; Lightfoot renders them <span class="bld">orderly array</span> and <span class="bld">solid front</span> respectively. “The enforced companionship of St Paul with the soldiers of the Prætorian Guard at this time (<a href="/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Php 1:13</a>) might have suggested this image. At all events in the contemporary Epistle (<a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm" title="Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;">Ephesians 6:14</a> sq.) we have an elaborate metaphor from the armour of a soldier” (Lightfoot).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Stedfastness</span> (<span class="ital">solidity</span>) <span class="ital">of your faith</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—cp. <a href="/acts/16-5.htm" title="And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.">Acts 16:5</a> (lit., “<span class="ital">grew solid in</span> (or <span class="ital">by</span>) <span class="ital">their faith</span>”); <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm" title="Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.">1 Peter 5:9</a> (lit., “<span class="ital">whom resist, solid in</span> (or <span class="ital">by</span>) <span class="ital">your faith</span>”).—The “solidity” in all these places implies at once the compact spiritual steadiness of the community and (the true and necessary condition to such steadiness) the simplicity and thoroughness of the individual as a believer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χαίρων καὶ Βλέπων</span>, <span class="ital">joying and beholding</span>) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> beholding with joy.—<span class="greekheb">τάξιν</span>, <span class="ital">order</span>) lest anything should <span class="ital">be out of joint</span> (‘lame’), <a href="/hebrews/12-13.htm" title="And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.">Hebrews 12:13</a>.

The connection of this verse with the last is not obvious. Ellicott, following Chrysostom, makes St. Paul's spiritual presence the reason for his being able to give the Colossians this warning; Meyer, his bodily absence the reason for their needing it. It is better, with Lightfoot, to see here a general explanatory reference to the previous context, a renewed declaration (ver. 1) of watchful interest in these distant brethren and a hearty acknowledgment of their Christian loyalty. The tone of authoritative warning just assumed (ver. 4) is thus justified, and yet softened (compare the apologetic tone of <a href="/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14, 15</a>). The phrase, "if I am absent," does not imply a previous <span class="accented">presence</span> (see note, ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ</span> (<a href="/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4-8, 27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). St. Paul dos not say, "rejoicing in beholding." The consciousness of union with brethren far away, whom he has never seen (ver. 1), is itself a joy; and this joy is heightened by what he sees through the eyes of Epaphras (<a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 6-8</a>: comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>) of the condition of this Church. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are military terms, denoting the "ordered array" and "solid front" of an army prepared for battle (Lightfoot, Hofmann): comp. <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, etc.; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>. Others find the figure of a <span class="accented">building</span> underlying the second word - Vulgate, <span class="accented">firmamentum</span> ("solid basis") - and this is its more usual meaning, and agrees with ver. 7 and <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a> (comp. <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>; <a href="/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a>; also <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, LXX, for the <span class="accented">noun</span>, not found, elsewhere in the New Testament).
