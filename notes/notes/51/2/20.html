In virtue of the former participation, he exhorts them to be dead to the law of outward ordinances; in virtue of the latter, to have a life hid with Christ in God.<p>(20) <span class= "bld">If ye be dead with Christ.</span>—The whole idea of the death with Christ and resurrection with Him is summed up by St. Paul in <a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3-9</a>, in direct connection (as also here, see <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>) with the entrance upon Christian life in baptism, “We are buried with Him by baptism unto death . . . we are dead with Christ . . . we are planted together in the likeness of His death . . . that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we also should walk in newness of life . . . planted together in the likeness of His resurrection . . . alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” The death with Christ is a death unto “the life of the flesh.” But this may be (as in <a href="/context/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6-7</a>; <a href="/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>) “the life of sin”; or it may be the outward and visible life “of the world.” The latter is the sense to be taken here. This outward life is under “ordinances” (see <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>), under the “rudiments of the world” (see <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>), or, generally, “under law.” Of such a life St. Paul says (in <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>), “I through the Law died to the Law, that I might live unto God.” There (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>), as here, he brands as unspiritual the subjection to the “weak and beggarly elements” of mere ordinances. Of course it is clear that in their place such ordinances have their value, both as means to an end, and as symbols of an inner reality of self-devotion. The true teaching as to these is found in our Lord’s declaration to the Pharisees as to spiritual things and outward ordinances, “These things (the spiritual things) ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others (the outward observances) undone” (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>). In later times St. Paul declared with Judicial calmness, “The Law is good if a man use it lawfully” (<a href="/1_timothy/1-8.htm" title="But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;">1Timothy 1:8</a>). But to exalt these things to the first place was a fatal superstition, which, both in its earlier and later phases, he denounces unsparingly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/colossians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/colossians/2-20.htm" title=" Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,...">Colossians 2:20-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— The inference begun <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a> is continued.

Or the sense may be, Since you professed yourselves at your baptism to be spiritually dead with Christ, and by his death to be freed even from the ceremonies of the law, (though of God’s own institution,) why should you submit to superstitious rites and ordinances of the like kind invented by men? <span class="ital">Touch not </span>— Any unclean thing; <span class="ital">taste not </span>— Any forbidden meat; <span class="ital">handle not </span>— Any consecrated vessel. Most commentators suppose that the Jewish ceremonies only are here referred to, and that this was directed to the Jewish converts at Colosse: but “as I have no doubt,” says Macknight, “that it was intended for the Gentiles, I think the ordinances of which the apostle speaks were the rules of the Pythagoreans respecting abstinence from animal food, and of the Platonists concerning the worshipping of angels, condemned <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>, which it seems some of the church at Colosse had actually begun to follow; perhaps at the persuasion of the Judaizing teachers, who wished to subject them to all the rites of the law.” <span class="ital">Which all are to perish in the using </span>— All which things cannot be used, but they must perish in and by the use of them, being made merely for the body, and with it going to corruption, and having therefore no further use, no influence on the mind. The original expression, however, <span class="greekheb">εις φθοραν τη αποχρησει</span>, may be rendered, <span class="ital">tend to corruption, in, </span>or <span class="ital">by, the abuse of them; </span>and the word <span class="greekheb">φθορα </span>being often used by St. Peter, not for a <span class="ital">natural, </span>but a <span class="ital">moral </span>corruption, (see <a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm" title="Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.">2 Peter 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-19.htm" title="While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.">2 Peter 2:19</a>,) the meaning of the verse may be, that when these ceremonies are observed in compliance with the commands and doctrines of men as things necessary, they corrupt men who thus abuse them. Thus Doddridge: <span class="ital">“All which things tend to </span>the <span class="ital">corruption </span>of that excellent religion into which you have the honour to be initiated, <span class="ital">by the abuse </span>of them, <span class="ital">according to the commandments and doctrines of </span>mistaken and ill-designing <span class="ital">men, </span>who insist so eagerly upon them, as if they were essential to salvation.” <span class="ital">Which things indeed have a show, </span>a pretence, <span class="ital">of wisdom </span>— Of being an excellent doctrine, or wise institution, and are, in that view, gravely insisted upon, especially by the more rigorous sects; <span class="ital">in will-worship </span>— A worship, or service, which they themselves have devised. “The word <span class="greekheb">εθελοθρησκεια </span>nearly resembles the phrase found <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>, <span class="greekheb">θελων εν θρησκεια</span>, <span class="ital">delighting in the worship. </span>But it can hardly be literally translated, so as to express the same idea. But the meaning is, a worship of human invention, consequently performed from one’s own will.” <span class="ital">And </span>in an affected <span class="ital">humility and neglecting of the body </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">αφειδια σωματος</span>, <span class="ital">a not sparing of the body; </span>namely, by subjecting it to much mortification, in denying it many gratifications, and putting it to many inconveniences. <span class="ital">Not in any honour </span>— Namely, of the body; or <span class="ital">not of any real value, </span>as <span class="greekheb">τιμη </span>may be rendered, namely, before God: <span class="ital">to the satisfying of the flesh </span>— Nor do they, upon the whole, mortify, but <span class="ital">satisfy the flesh. </span>They indulge man’s corrupt nature, his self-will, pride, and desire of being distinguished from others. Doddridge reads, <span class="ital">to the dishonourable satisfying of the flesh; </span>their severity to the body, rigorous as it seemed, being no true mortification, nor tending to dispose the mind to it. On the contrary, while it puffed men up with a vain conceit of their own sanctity, it might be said rather to satisfy the flesh, even while it seemed most to afflict it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - In view of all that has been said.

Or "seeing ye are dead with Christ"; for these words do not signify any doubt about it, but suppose it, and press what is taken for granted. They were dead with Christ by virtue of union to him; they being one with him, and considered in him as their head and representative, died in him, and with him; they were crucified with him, as they are said to be buried with him, and risen with him; they were dead with him, by having communion with him in his death; they partook of the benefits of it, as redemption, pardon, justification, and reconciliation; and they were planted together with him in the likeness of his death, not merely partakers of his sufferings, or suffered with him, and were conformable unto his death, by undergoing such like things as he did, but as he died unto sin, and lived unto God, so did they; and through the virtue and efficacy of his death were dead to sin, so as that it was not imputed to them, so as to be freed and discharged from it, that it could not damn and destroy them; yea, so as that itself was crucified with him, and destroyed by him: and also to the law, to the moral law; not but that they lived according to it, as in the hands of Christ, in their walk and conversation, but did not seek for life, righteousness, and salvation by it; they were dead unto it as to justification by it, and even to obedience to it in a rigorous and compulsive way; and to all its terrors and threatenings, being moved to a regard to it from a principle of love to Christ; and to all its accusations and charges, its curses and condemnation, and as a ministration of death, fearing neither a corporeal, nor an eternal one: they were dead also to the ceremonial law, and were free <p>from the rudiments, or "elements" <p>of the world: the ordinances of a worldly sanctuary, the rites and ceremonies of the world, or state of the Jews, in opposition to, and distinction from, the Gospel dispensation, or times of the Messiah, called, and that by them, , "the world to come": these were like letters to a language, or like the grammar, which contains the rudiments of it; these were the first principles of the oracles of God, which led to Christ, and had their accomplishment and end in him; and so believers were dead unto them, and delivered from them, as they were also to the world, the Jewish state, and were entered into the world to come; and even to this present evil world, and to the men and things of it, being by Christ crucified to it, and that to them: upon all which the apostle thus reasons, <p>why, as though living in the world; since ye are dead unto it, and from the rudiments of it, why should ye be as though ye lived in it? his meaning is not, that they should not live in the world, nor among the men of it, for then they must needs go out of the world; saints may live in the world, though they are not of it, and among the inhabitants of it, though they do not belong to them, but to another and better country: nor does he suggest, that they lived according to the course of the world, as they did in their unregenerate state; but what he seems to blame them for, and reason with them about, was, that they acted as if they sought for life and righteousness in the rudiments of the world, or by their obedience to ceremonial rites, or human inventions: for he adds, <p>are ye subject to ordinances? not civil and political ones, which are for the better and more orderly government of kingdoms, states, and cities, for these the saints ought to be subject to, both for the Lord's sake, and conscience sake; nor Gospel ordinances, as baptism, and the Lord's supper, for such all believers ought to submit unto; but either legal ones, the weak and beggarly elements, the yoke of bondage, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, the handwriting of ordinances, which some were desirous of conforming to; or rather the ordinances and appointments of the Jewish fathers, the traditions of the elders, their constitutions and decrees, which are collected together, and make up their Misna, or oral law; and so the argument is from the one to the other, from the greater to the less, that if they were delivered by Christ from the burdensome rites of the ceremonial law, which were originally appointed by God, it must be great weakness in them to be subject to the ordinances of men; or both the institutions of the ceremonial law, and the decrees of the Jewish doctors about them, which were devised by them, and added to them, and imposed as necessary to be observed, may be intended; of which the apostle gives some particulars in <a href="/colossians/2-21.htm">Colossians 2:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{20}</span> Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</span><p>(20) Now last of all he fights against the second type of corruptions, that is to say, against mere superstitions, invented by men, which partly deceive the simplicity of some with their craftiness, and partly with their foolish superstitions and to be laughed at: as when godliness, remission of sins, or any such like virtue, is put in some certain type of meat, and such like things, which the inventors of such rites themselves do not understand, because indeed it is not there. And he uses an argument taken of comparison. If by the death of Christ who established a new covenant with his blood, you are delivered from those external rites with which it pleased the Lord to prepare the world, as it were by certain rudiments, to that full knowledge of true religion, why would you be burdened with traditions, I know not what, as though you were citizens of this world, that is to say, as though you depended upon this life, and earthly things? Now this is the reason why before verse eight he followed another order than he does in the refutation: because he shows by this what degrees false religions came into the world, that is, beginning first by curious speculations of the wise, after which in process of time succeeded gross superstition, against which mischiefs the Lord set at length that service of the Law, which some abused in like sort. But in the refutation he began with the abolishing of the Law service, that he might show by comparison, that those false services ought much more to be taken away.<p>(e) As though your felicity stood in these earthly things, and the kingdom of God was not rather spiritual.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-20.htm" title=" Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,">Colossians 2:20</a> f.

The Apostle, recalling them to the time of their conversion, points out how inconsistent with a death to the elemental spirits any submission to ordinances belonging to their sphere would be. The death of the believer with Christ is a death to his old relations, to sin, law, guilt, the world. It is a death which Christ has Himself undergone (<a href="/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a>). Here it is specially their death to the angels, who had ruled their old life, and under whose charge the Law and its ceremonies especially stood. They had died with Christ to legalism, how absurd then for ordinances to be imposed upon them.—<span class="greekheb">εἰ ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ</span>: “if, as is the case, you died in union with Christ”. The aorist points to the definite fact, which took place once for all. It was in union with Christ, for thus they were able to repeat Christ’s own experience.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων τοῦ κόσμου</span>. The use of <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἀποθν</span>. expresses more strongly than the dative (as in <a href="/romans/6-2.htm" title="God forbid.

Since they were still living in the physical world <span class="greekheb">κός</span>. has evidently an ethical sense.—<span class="greekheb">δογματίζεσθε</span> may be middle, “subject yourselves to ordinances,” or passive. Since Paul nowhere says that the readers had accepted the false teaching, the latter is better: “Why are ye prescribed to?” (Mey., Winer, Hofm., Findl., Haupt.) Alford also takes it as a passive, but thinks it implies a keener rebuke than the middle. The middle asserts rather that they had submitted, the passive need only imply, not their submission, but that their resistance might have been more energetic.

The life of faith and love was giving way to an arbitrary discipline, far different from the obedience of the heart to the will of God in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-20.htm" title=" Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,">Colossians 2:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ</span>, <span class="ital">if</span>) The inference, begun at <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>, is continued; and at ch. <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>, a new inference follows.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπεθάνετε ἀπὸ</span>, <span class="ital">ye are dead from</span>) An abbreviated expression, <span class="ital">i.e. dead</span>, and so set free <span class="ital">from</span> the elements, etc.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων</span>, <span class="ital">from the elements</span>) <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>.—<span class="greekheb">δογματίζεσθε</span>) in the Middle voice, <span class="ital">you receive</span> (take up) <span class="ital">dogmas</span>, ordinances.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The apostle's fourth and last warning is directed against <span class="accented">ascetic rules of life.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world</span> (vers. 8, 10-13; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-17</a>). "Therefore" is struck out by the Revisers on the best authority. It would imply a logical dependence of this verse upon the last, which does not exist. This warning, like those of vers. 16, 18, looks back to the previous section, and especially to vers. 8, 10, 12. It is a new application of St. Paul's fundamental principle of the union of the Christian with Christ in his death and resurrection (see notes, vers. 11, 12). Accepting the death of Christ as supplying the means of his redemption (<a href="/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14, 22</a>), and the law of his future life (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>), the Christian breaks with and becomes <span class="accented">dead</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> and) <span class="accented">from</span> all other, former religious principles; which appear to him now but childish, tentative gropings after and preparations for what is given him in Christ (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-2.htm">Galatians 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>). On "rudiments," see note, ver. 8. There these "rudiments of the world" appear as general ("philosophical") principles of religion, intrinsically false and empty; here they are moral rules of life, mean and worthless substitutes for "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus." (For the Pauline idiom, "died from (so as to be separate, or free from)," comp. <a href="/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2, 6</a>; <a href="/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Why, as</span> (men) <span class="cmt_word">living in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">world, are you made subject to decrees</span> (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). To adopt the rules of the new teachers is to return to the worldly, pre-Christian type of religion which the Christian had once for all abandoned (<a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>). "World" bears the emphasis rather than "living" ("having one's principle of life:" comp. <a href="/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>). Standing without the article, it signifies "the world as such," in its natural character and attainments, without Christ (ver. 8; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (the verb only here in the New Testament) is passive rather than middle in voice (Winer, p. 326; see Meyer <span class="accented">in loc.</span>); literally, <span class="accented">why are yon being dogmatized, overridden with decrees?</span> Compare "spell" (ver. 8), "judge" (ver. 16), for the domineering spirit of the false teacher. The "dogmas" or "decrees" of ver. 14 (see note) are those of the Divine Law; these are of human imposition (vers. 8, 22), which their authors, however, seem to put upon a level with the former. In each case the <span class="accented">decree</span> is an external enforcement, not an inner principle of life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye be dead (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Rev., more correctly, ye died; the aorist tense indicating a definite event.
