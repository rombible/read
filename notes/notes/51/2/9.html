First, “All the fulness of the Godhead”—not a mere emanation from the Supreme Being. Next, “dwells” and remains for ever—not descending on Him for a time and leaving Him again. Lastly, “bodily,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as incarnate in His humanity. The whole is an extension and enforcement of <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>, “God was pleased that in Him all the fulness should dwell.” The horror of all that was material, as having in it the seed of evil, induced denial either of the reality of our Lord’s body, or of its inseparable connection with the Godhead in Him. Hence the emphasis here; as also we find (somewhat later) in St. John, “The Word was made flesh” (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>); “The spirit which confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . . . is the spirit of antichrist” (<a href="/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1John 4:3</a>).<p>On the meaning of “fullness” (<span class= "ital">plerorna</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>see <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm" title=" That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;">Colossians 1:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>.

I assuredly believe, that as it contains an evident allusion to the Shechinah, in which God dwelt, so it ultimately refers to the adorable mystery of the union of the divine and human natures in the person of the glorious Emmanuel, which makes him such an object of our hope and confidence, as the most exalted creature, with the most glorious endowments, could never of himself be.” <span class="ital">And ye are complete in him </span>— You have in and from him every thing necessary to your salvation, all the wisdom and knowledge, the righteousness and strength, the holiness, support, and comfort that you stand in need of, to enable you to glorify God on earth, and to prepare you for being glorified with him in heaven.

But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in him dwelleth - That is, this was the great and central doctrine that was to be maintained about Christ, that all the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him. Every system which denied this was a denial of the doctrine which they had been taught; and against every thing that would go to undermine this; they were especially to be on their guard. Almost all heresy has been begun by some form of the denial of the great central truth of the incarnation of the Son of God.<p>All the fulness - Notes, <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>.<p>Of the Godhead - Of the Divinity, the divine nature - &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  theote&#772;s.

This word also is found nowhere else in the New Testament, though the adjective bodily - &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  so&#772;matikos - occurs twice; <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>, "in a bodily shape;" and <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, "for bodily exercise profiteth little." The word means, "having a bodily appearance, instead of existing or appearing in a spiritual form;" and the fair sense of the phrase is, that the fullness of the divine nature became incarnate, and was indwelling in the body of the Redeemer. It does not meet the case to say, as Crellius does, that the "whole divine will was in him," for the word &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;  theote&#772; - "godhead" - does not mean the will of God; and it is as certainly true that the inspired prophets were under the control of the divine will, as that the Saviour was. Nor can it mean, as Socinus supposes, that the fulness of divine knowledge dwelt in him, for this is not the proper meaning of the word (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  theote&#772;s) "godhead;" nor can it mean, for the same reason, that a fullness of divine gifts was intrusted to him. The language is such as would be obviously employed on the supposition that God became incarnate, and appeared in human form; and there is no other idea which it so naturally expresses, nor is there any other which it can be made to express without a forced construction. The meaning is, that it was not anyone attribute of the Deity that became incarnate in the Saviour; that he was not merely endowed with the knowledge, or the power, or the wisdom of God; but that the whole Deity thus became incarnate, and appeared in human form; compare <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>; <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>.

This is to be understood, not of the doctrine, or Gospel of Christ, as being a perfect revelation of the will of God; but of Christ, and particularly of his human nature, as consisting of a true body and a reasonable soul, in which the Godhead dwells in a most eminent manner: God indeed is everywhere by his powerful presence, was in the tabernacle and temple in a very singular manner, and dwells in the saints in a way of special grace; but resides in the human nature of Christ, in the highest and most exalted manner; that is to deity what the human body is to an human soul, it is the house in which it dwells: so Philo the Jew (t) calls the "Logos" the house of God, who is the soul of the universe; and elsewhere says (u), that God himself has filled the divine Logos wholly with incorporeal powers. The Godhead dwells in Christ as in a tabernacle, in allusion to the tabernacle of Moses, which looked mean without side, but glorious within; where God granted his presence, and accepted the sacrifices of his people; the human nature of Christ is the true antitypical tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man; and sometimes is called a temple, in allusion to Solomon's; and which is filled with the train of the divine perfections, signified by fulness here: for not the fulness of grace, or a communicative fulness, is here meant; nor the relative fulness, the church; but the fulness of the divine nature, of all the perfections of deity, such as eternity, immensity, omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, immutability, necessary and self existence, and every other; for if anyone perfection was wanting, the fulness, much less all the fulness of the Godhead, would not be in him. The act of inhabitation denotes the union of the two natures in Christ, and expresses the distinction of them; and is to be understood of the Godhead, as subsisting in the person of the Son of God, and not as subsisting in the person of the Father, or of the Spirit; and shows the permanency of this union, it is a perpetual abiding one; and this fulness is not dependent on the Father's pleasure; it is not said of this as of another fulness, <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>; that it pleased the Father that it should dwell in him: the manner in which it dwells, is "bodily"; not by power, as in the universe; nor by grace, as in the saints; nor by any glorious emanations of it, as in heaven; nor by gifts, as in the prophets and eminent men of God; nor by signs symbols, and shadows, as in the tabernacle and temple; but essentially and personally, or by personal union of the divine nature, as subsisting in the Son of God to an human body, chosen and prepared for that purpose, together with a reasonable human soul; which is the great mystery of godliness, the glory of the Christian religion, and what qualified Christ for, and recommends him to us as a Saviour; and is a reason why, as these words are, that the Gospel should be abode by, continued in, and that with thankfulness: nor should any regard be had to vain and deceitful philosophy, to the traditions of men, or rudiments of the world: Christ only is to be looked to, attended, and followed, who has all fulness in him, <p>(t) De migr.

See on <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>. The erroneous attempts that have been made to explain away the literal meaning thus definitely and deliberately expressed by Paul, are similar to those in <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>. One of these, in particular, is the mis-explanation referring it to the <span class="ital">church</span> as the God-filled organ of divine self-revelation (Heinrichs, Baumgarten-Crusius, Schenkel) which has its dwelling-place in Christ.[92] Already Theodoret (comp. <span class="greekheb">τινές</span> in Chrysostom), indeed, quotes the explanation that <span class="ital">Christ</span> signifies the church <span class="ital">in which</span> the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> dwells, but on account of <span class="greekheb">σωματικῶς</span> hesitates to agree to it, and rather accedes to the common view, thereby deviating from his interpretation of <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>.

The reference of the whole statement, however, to the <span class="ital">exalted</span> Christ is placed beyond question by the use of the present <span class="greekheb">κατοικεῖ</span>, which asserts the <span class="ital">presently existing</span> relation, without requiring a <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> along with it (in opposition to Huther). The renderings: <span class="ital">essentialiter</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐσιωδῶς</span> (Cyril, Theophylact, Calvin, Beza, and others, including Usteri, Steiger, Olshausen, Huther, Bisping), in which case some thought of a contrast to the divine <span class="greekheb">ἐνέργεια</span> in the <span class="ital">prophets</span> (see Theophylact), and: <span class="ital">realiter</span> (Augustine, Erasmus, Vatablus, Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, Schoettgen, Wolf, Nösselt, Bleek, and others), in which was found the opposite of <span class="greekheb">τυπικῶς</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a>), are linguistically inappropriate; for <span class="greekheb">σωματικός</span> never means anything else than <span class="ital">corporeus</span>. Comp. on the adverb, Plut. <span class="ital">Mor</span>. p. 424 D. The less justifiable is the hypothesis of Rich. Schmidt (<span class="ital">Paul.

Those who adopt the erroneous explanation of <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> as referring to the <span class="ital">church</span>, assign to <span class="greekheb">σωματικῶς</span> the meaning: “so that the church stands related to Him <span class="ital">as His body</span>” (Baumgarten-Crusius and Schenkel), which issues in the absurdity that the body of Christ is held to dwell in Christ, whereas conversely Christ could not but dwell in His body. It is true that the church is related to Christ as His body, not, however, in so far as <span class="ital">it</span> dwells <span class="ital">in Him</span> (and, according to the context, this must have been the case <span class="ital">here</span>, if the explanation in question be adopted), but either in so far as <span class="ital">He</span> dwells <span class="ital">in it</span>, or in so far as He is <span class="ital">its Head</span>, which latter thought is quite foreign to the connection of the passage; for even in <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a> Christ is not called the Head of the <span class="ital">church</span>. It is, morever, to be observed, that the adverb is placed emphatically at the end. The special <span class="ital">reason</span>, however, on account of which the <span class="greekheb">κατοικεῖν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is thus prominently set forth as bodily, cannot, indeed, be directly shown to have been supplied by the circumstances of the Colossians, but is nevertheless to be recognised in an apologetic interest of opposition to the false teachers, who by their doctrines concerning the angels (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἀρχῆς κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσ</span>.) must have broken up, in a spiritualistic sense, the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα τῆς θεότητος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[92] Thus, indeed, the <span class="ital">fulness of the Godhead</span> has been removed from Christ, but there has only been gained instead of it the unbiblical idea that <span class="ital">the church</span> dwells in Christ. The church has its support in Christ as the corner-stone (<a href="/context/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;...">Ephesians 2:20-21</a>), but it does not <span class="ital">dwell</span> in Him.

The false teachers represented the fulness of the Godhead as distributed among the angels, and thus led their victims captive. Paul’s warning against the false doctrine thus rests on the fact that it was in Christ that the whole fulness dwelt.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> is emphatic, in Him and in Him alone.—<span class="greekheb">κατοικεῖ</span>: “permanently dwells”. The reference is to the Exalted State, not only on account of the present, but of the context and Paul’s Christology generally.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς θεότητος</span>: “all the fulness of the Godhead”. <span class="greekheb">πᾶν</span> is emphatic, the whole fulness dwells in Christ, therefore it is vain to seek it wholly or partially outside of Him. <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θ</span>. is not to be taken (as by Ol.) to mean the perfection of Divinity, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, ideal holiness. Nor can it mean the Church, for which <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a> gives no support, nor yet the universe, either of which must have been very differently expressed. The addition of <span class="greekheb">θεότητος</span> defines <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. as the fulness of Deity. The word is to be distinguished from <span class="greekheb">θειότης</span> as Deity, the being God, from Divinity, the being Divine or Godlike. The passage thus asserts the real Deity of Christ.—<span class="greekheb">σωματικῶς</span>. This word is very variously interpreted. The reference is usually taken to be to the glorified body of Christ, or (as by Lightf.) to the Incarnation, and the word is translated “in bodily fashion”. Apart from the question whether the word naturally expresses this, there is the difficulty caused by the contrast implied in its emphatic position. This contrast is sometimes thought to be to the pre-incarnate state, but this has no relevance here. A contrast to the angels might be in point, but they were closely connected with bodies, so the contrast in this respect did not exist. But neither is Soden’s view that while the angels have bodies what is expressed in them is only <span class="greekheb">θειότης</span> (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>) not <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεότητος</span>, a tenable explanation, since this is just read into the words, not elicited from them; nor could such a distinction have occurred to the readers. This interpretation of <span class="greekheb">σωμ</span>., then, as expressing the indwelling of the fulness in a body, although said by Abbott to be “the only one tenable,” is encumbered with grave difficulties, and has been rejected by several commentators. Many have taken it to mean “really” (recently Bleek, Kl[12], Everling, Cremer). This is supported by the contrast of <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> with <span class="greekheb">σκιά</span> in <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a>, the indwelling is real and not shadowy or typical. But <span class="greekheb">σωματικῶς</span> could hardly express this shade of meaning unless the antithesis was expressed. Oltramare translates “personally, in His person”. But he quotes no instances of the adverb, but only of <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span>. And Haupt’s criticism is just, that this sense might suggest that in God Himself it dwelt impersonally. After an elaborate examination of the various views, Haupt puts forward the explanation that <span class="greekheb">σωματ</span>. relates to <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θ</span>., and is to be translated “in the form of a body”. The meaning he takes to be that the fulness exists in Christ as a body, that is as a complete and organic whole. This suits the context and the general argument better than the reference to Christ’s own body. In contrast to the distribution of the fulness among the angels, or to the view that it dwelt only partially in Him, Paul insists that all the fulness dwells in Him, and not fragmentarily but as an organic whole. This view, like Oltramare’s, is supported only by references to the use of <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span>. This is not a fatal objectiön, and its harmony with the context makes it the most probable interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[12] Klöpper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">For</span>] He is about to shew that “Christ” is the antithesis of this false gospel in two respects; (<span class="ital">a</span>) His glorious Person is all in all as the substance of the true Gospel; (<span class="ital">b</span>) His code of resulting observance appears not in an ascetic rule but in a life of liberty and purity in union with the Risen Lord Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in him dwelleth</span> &c.] See above on <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Godhead</span>] The Greek word (<span class="ital">theotês</span>) stands here alone in the N.T.

But in the Incarnation of the Son this indwelling dwelling had been, “for us men and our salvation,” conditioned by the fact of the Lord’s true human Body. In that Body, and through it, was manifested His union with us, and was wrought out His work for us in life and death. From Him now exalted, not only as the Son but as the Son Incarnate, Slain, and Risen, radiates to all His members the Holy Ghost (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm" title="And I beheld, and, see, in the middle of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.">Revelation 5:6</a>). So, for us, the Divine Plenitude dwells in Him “bodily-wise”; not circumscribed by His holy human Body, which “is in heaven and not here” (see the last Rubric of the Communion Office), but eternally conditioned, as to our fruition of It, by the fact of His Incarnation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὃτι</span>) <span class="ital">for, since</span>.

Therefore the language is varied. The Godhead itself, as it were the very entire substance (essence) of the Godhead, dwells in Christ, in a manner most immediate (vividly present) and most real. The type was God’s glory dwelling in the temple of Solomon. <span class="greekheb">Σῶμα</span>, <span class="ital">the body</span>, does not always denote the body properly so called; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm" title=" Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.">Colossians 2:17</a>[7] “Of the <span class="ital">Godhead</span>,” in its <span class="ital">essence</span> not merely <span class="greekheb">θειότητος</span>, of the <span class="ital">godlike character</span>.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because in him dwelleth all the fulness</span> (or, <span class="accented">completeness</span>) of the Godhead bodily (<a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>; <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 14</a>). In <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18-20</a> we viewed a series of events; here we have an abiding fact. The whole plenitude of our Lord's Divine-human person and powers, as the complete Christ, was definitively constituted when, in the exercise of his kingly prerogative, "he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." "From henceforth" that fulness evermore <span class="accented">resides in him</span> (comp. note, <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>). The undivided <span class="accented">pleroma</span> of <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a> now reveals its twofold nature: it is "the fulness of the Godhead," and yet "dwells corporeally in him." "Godhead" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) is the abstract of "God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), not of the adjective "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate therefore, wrongly, <span class="accented">divinitatis:</span> comp. <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>; <a href="/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>; Wisd. 18:9), and denotes,"not Divine excellences, but the Divine nature" (Bengel); see Trench's 'Synonyms.' Schenkel and others, guided by a conjecture of Theodoret, have found here the <span class="accented">Church</span>, supporting their view by a very doubtful interpretation of <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. Still more groundless is the identification of this <span class="accented">pleroma</span> with <span class="accented">the created world.</span> The apostle unmistakably affirms that the Divine nature, in its entirety, belongs to the Church's Christ. The literal sense of "bodily" (maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Hofmann, after Chrysostom and Athanasius) has been avoided by those who render it "wholly" (Jerome); "essentially, substantially" (Cyril, Theophylact, Calvin, Klopper), as opposed to "relatively" or "partially;" "truly" (Augustine, Erasmus, Bengel, Bleek), as opposed to "figuretively" (ver. 17). The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (always <span class="accented">literal</span> in classical usage, along with its adjective) occurs only here in the New Testament; the adjective "bodily" in <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>. "The body of his flesh" in <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> affords a truer parallel than the language of ver. 17, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, bears an exceptional sense (see note). Elsewhere St. Paul balances in similar fashion expressions relating to the twofold nature of Christ (see parallels). The assertion that "all the fulness of Deity" dwells in Christ negatives the Alexandrine "philosophy," with its cloud of mediating angel powers and spiritual emanations; the assertion that it dwells in him <span class="accented">bodily</span> equally condemns that contempt for the body and the material world which was the chief practical tenet of the same school (comp. notes on Colossians 1:22 and Colossians 2:23). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Fullness<p>See on <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>.<p>Godhead (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.

Appropriate there, because God personally would not be known from His revelation in nature, but only His attributes - His majesty and glory. Here Paul is speaking of the essential and personal deity as belonging to Christ. So Bengel: "Not the divine attributes, but the divine nature."<p>Bodily (&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>In bodily fashion or bodily-wise. The verse contains two distinct assertions: 1. That the fullness of the Godhead eternally dwells in Christ. The present tense &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; dwelleth, is used like &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is (the image), <a href="//biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, to denote an eternal and essential characteristic of Christ's being. The indwelling of the divine fullness in Him is characteristic of Him as Christ, from all ages and to all ages. Hence the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him before His incarnation, when He was "in the form of God" (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>). The Word in the beginning, was with God and was God (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>). It dwelt in Him during His incarnation. It was the Word that became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth, and His glory which was beheld was the glory as of the Only begotten of the Father (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; compare <a href="//biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>). The fullness of the Godhead dwells in His glorified humanity in heaven.<p>2. The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him in a bodily way, clothed the body. This means that it dwells in Him as one having a human body. This could not be true of His preincarnate state, when He was "in the form of God," for the human body was taken on by Him in the fullness of time, when "He became in the likeness of men" (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>), when the Word became flesh. The fullness of the Godhead dwelt in His person from His birth to His ascension. He carried His human body with Him into heaven, and in His glorified body now and ever dwells the fullness of the Godhead.<p>"O, for a sight, a blissful sight<p>Of our Almighty Father's throne!<p>There sits the Savior crowned with light,<p>Clothed in a body like our own.<p>"Adoring saints around Him stand,<p>And thrones and powers before Him fall;<p>The God shines gracious through the man,<p>continued...</body></html>
