When St. Paul deals with the legal and coercive aspect of the Law, he calls it “the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.” (See <a href="/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>, and Note there.) When he turns to its ritual aspect, he describes it as simply foreshadowing or typifying the substance; and therefore useful before the revelation of the substance, useless or (if trusted in) worse than useless, after it. In every way “Christ is the end of the Law” (<a href="/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection.

They were only a dim outline of future things, not the reality.<p>But the body is of Christ - The reality, the substance. All that they signified is of or in Christ. Between those things themselves which are in Christ, and those which only represented or prefigured them, there is as much difference as there is between a body and a shadow; a solid substance and a mere outline.

By Christ, and under the Gospel dispensation; that is, they were types, figures, and representations of spiritual and evangelical things: the different "meats and drinks", clean and unclean, allowed or forbidden by the law, were emblems of the two people, the Jews and Gentiles, the one clean, the other unclean; but since these are become one in Christ, the distinction of meats is ceased, these shadows are gone; and also of the different food of regenerate and unregenerate souls, the latter feeding on impure food, the ashes and husks of sensual lusts, or their own works, the former on the milk and meat in the Gospel, the wholesome words of Christ; and likewise the clean meat was a shadow of Christ himself, whose flesh is meat indeed, and whose blood is drink indeed. The "holy days", or "feasts" of the Jews, the feasts of tabernacles, of the passover and Pentecost, were types of Christ; the feast of tabernacles, though it was in remembrance of the Israelites dwelling in tents and booths when they came out of Egypt, yet was also a representation of the people of God dwelling in the earthly houses of their tabernacles here on earth; and particularly of Christ's dwelling, or tabernacling in human nature, and who likewise was born at the time of this feast; See Gill on . The passover, as it was a commemoration of the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt, and of God's passing over their houses when he smote the firstborn of the Egyptians, so it was a type of Christ our passover sacrificed for us, and was kept by Moses in the faith of him, <a href="/hebrews/11-28.htm">Hebrews 11:28</a>; there is a very great resemblance, in many particulars, between Christ and the paschal lamb; See Gill on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>. The feast of Pentecost, or the feast of harvest and firstfruits, was a shadow of the firstfruits of the Spirit, which Christ having received, gave to his disciples on that day; and of the harvest of souls to be gathered under the Gospel dispensation, of which the conversion of the three thousand on the day of Pentecost was an earnest and pledge. The "new moon" was typical of the church, which is fair as the moon, and receives all her light from Christ the sun of righteousness; and of the renewed state of the church under the Gospel dispensation, when the old things of the law are passed away, and all things relating to church order, ordinances, and discipline, are become new. The "sabbaths" were also shadows of future things; the grand sabbatical year, or the fiftieth year sabbath, or jubilee, in which liberty was proclaimed throughout the land, a general release of debts, and restoration of inheritances, prefigured the liberty we have by Christ from sin, Satan, and the law, the payment of all our debts by Christ, and the right we have through him to the heavenly and incorruptible inheritance. The seventh year sabbath, in which there was no tilling of the land, no ploughing, sowing, nor reaping, was an emblem of salvation through Christ by free grace, and not by the works of men; and the seventh day sabbath was a type of that spiritual rest we have in Christ now, and of that eternal rest we shall have with him in heaven hereafter: now these were but shadows, not real things; or did not contain the truth and substance of the things themselves, of which they were shadows; and though they were representations of divine and spiritual things, yet dark ones, they had not so much as the very image of the things; they were but shadows, and like them fleeting and passing away, and now are gone: <p>but the body is of Christ: or, as the Syriac version reads it, "the body is Christ"; that is, the body, or sum and substance of these shadows, is Christ; he gave rise unto them, he existed before them, as the body is before the shadow; not only as God, as the Son of God, but as Mediator, whom these shadows regarded as such, and as such he cast them; and he is the end of them, the fulfilling end of them; they have all their accomplishment in him: and he is the body of spiritual and heavenly things; the substantial things and doctrines of the Gospel are all of Christ, they all come by him; all the truths, blessings, and promises of grace; are from him and by him, and he himself the sum of them all. The allusion seems to be to a way of speaking among the Jews, who were wont to call the root, foundation, substance, and essence of a thing,  "the body of it" (n): so they say (o), <p>"the constitutions concerning the sanctification of the offerings and the tithes, are, both the one and the other, , "the bodies", or substantial parts of the law: <p>and again (p), that "the constitutions or rules about the sabbath, the festivals and prevarications, they are as mountains that hang by an hair; for the Scripture is small, and the constitutions are many; the judgments and the services, the purifications and uncleannesses, and the incests, they have, upon which they can support themselves, and these, and these, are , "the bodies of the law": <p>they say (q) of a small section, or paragraph, that all the bodies of the law depend upon it: once more (r), <p>"the sabbaths, and the good days (the feasts or holy days) are  "the bodies" of the sign; <p>which the phylacteries or frontlets were for; but our apostle says, that Christ is the body and substance of all these shadows, in opposition to these sayings and notions of the Jews: some connect this last clause with the former part of the following verse, rendering it as the Arabic version thus, "because of the communion of the body of Christ, let no man condemn you"; and the Ethiopic version thus, "and let no man account you fools, because of the body of Christ", but there is nothing in the text to support these versions, <p>(n) Vid.

It is to be noted further: (1) The emphasis of confirmation lies not on <span class="greekheb">τῶν μελλόντων</span> (Beza), but on <span class="greekheb">σκιά</span>, in contrast to <span class="greekheb">τὸ σῶμα</span>. If, namely, the things in question are only the <span class="ital">shadow</span> of the Messianic, and do not belong to the reality thereof, they are—in accordance with this relatively non-essential, because merely typical nature of theirs—not of such a kind that salvation may be made dependent on their observance or non-observance, and adjudged or withheld accordingly. (2) The passage is not to be explained as if <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> stood in the place of <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">τὰ μέλλοντα</span> would denote the <span class="ital">Christian</span> relations already <span class="ital">then</span> existing, the <span class="greekheb">καινὴ διαθήκη</span>, the Christian plan of salvation, the Christian life, etc. (so usually since Chrysostom); but, on the contrary, that which is spoken of <span class="ital">is</span> shadow, not, indeed, as divinely appointed in the law (Hofmann)—for of <span class="ital">this</span> aspect of the elements in question the text contains nothing—but in so far as Paul sees it in its <span class="ital">actual condition</span> still at that time <span class="ital">present</span>. The <span class="greekheb">μέλλοντα</span> have <span class="ital">not yet been manifested at all</span>, and belong <span class="ital">altogether</span> (not merely as regards their <span class="ital">completion</span>, as de Wette thinks, comp. also Hofmann) to the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span>, which will begin with the coming again of Christ to set up His kingdom—a coming, however, which was expected as very near at hand. The <span class="greekheb">μέλλοντα</span> could only be viewed as having already <span class="ital">set in</span> either in whole or in part, if <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> and not <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> were used previously, and thereby the notion of futurity were to be taken <span class="ital">relatively</span>, in reference to a state of things then already <span class="ital">past</span> (comp. <a href="/galatians/3-23.htm" title="But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.">Galatians 3:23</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm" title="However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.">1 Timothy 1:16</a>), or if <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> were meant to be said from the standpoint of the <span class="ital">divine arrangement</span> of those things (Hofmann), or if this present tense expressed the <span class="ital">logical</span> present merely by way of enabling the mind to picture them (<a href="/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a>), which, however, is inadmissible here, since the elements indicated by <span class="greekheb">σκιά</span> still continued at this time, long after Christ’s earthly appearance, and were present really, and not merely in legal precepts or in theory. (3) The characteristic <span class="ital">quality</span>, in which the things concerned are meant to be presented by the figurative <span class="greekheb">σκιά</span>, is determined solely by the contrast of <span class="greekheb">τὸ σῶμα</span>, namely, as <span class="ital">unsubstantiality</span> in a Messianic aspect: <span class="ital">shadow</span> of the future, standing in relation to it, therefore doubtless as typically presignificant, but destitute and void of its reality. The reference to <span class="ital">transitoriness</span> (Spencer, <span class="ital">de legit, rit</span>. p. 214 f., Baumgarten-Crusius, and others) is purely imported.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ σῶμα</span>] <span class="ital">scil</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν μελλόντων</span>, <span class="ital">but the body</span> of the future.[117] Inasmuch as the legal state of things in <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a> stands to the future Messianic state in no other relation than that of the <span class="ital">shadow</span> to the living <span class="ital">body itself</span>, which casts the shadow, Paul thus, remaining faithful to his figure, designates as the <span class="ital">body</span> of the future <span class="ital">that</span> which is <span class="ital">real and essential</span> in it, which, according to the context, can be nothing else than just <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="greekheb">μέλλοντα</span> <span class="ital">themselves</span>, their concrete reality as contrasted with the shadowy form which preceded them. Accordingly, he might have conveyed the idea of the verse, but without its figurative garb, in this way: <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστι τύπος τῶν μελλόντων</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὐτὰ δὲ τὰ μέλλοντα Χριστοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>] <span class="ital">scil.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>, <span class="ital">belongs to Christ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">μέλλοντα</span>, namely, viewed under the figurative aspect of the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> which casts the shadow referred to, must stand in the same relation to Christ, as the body stands in to the <span class="ital">Head</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>); as the body now adumbrating itself, they must belong to Christ the <span class="ital">Head</span> of the body, in so far, namely, as He is <span class="ital">Lord and ruler</span> of all the relations of the future Messianic constitution, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. of the Messianic kingdom, of the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm" title=" Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:">Colossians 1:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>). Whosoever, therefore, holds to the <span class="ital">shadow</span> of the future, to the things of the law (as the false teachers do and require), and does not strive after the <span class="greekheb">μέλλοντα</span> themselves, after the <span class="ital">body</span> which has cast that shadow, does not hold to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, to whom as Head <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> (<span class="greekheb">τῆς σκιᾶς</span>) <span class="ital">belongs as His own</span>. This view, which is far removed from “distorting” the thought (as Hofmann objects), is required by the natural and obvious correlation of the conception of the <span class="ital">body</span> and its <span class="ital">head</span>, as also by <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>. There is much inaccuracy and irrelevancy in the views of expositors, because they have not taken <span class="greekheb">τὰ μέλλοντα</span> in the sense, or not purely in the sense, of the relations of the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span>, but in that of the then existing Christian relations, which in fact still belonged to the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν οὗτος</span>, and because, in connection therewith, they do not take up with clearness and precision the contextually necessary relation of the genitive <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> as denoting Him, whose the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> is, but resolve it into what they please, as <span class="ital">e.g</span>. Grotius (so also Bleek): “ad Christum pertinet, ab eo solo petenda est;” Huther: “the substance itself, to which those shadowy figures point, has <span class="ital">appeared in Christ;</span>” Ewald: “so far as there is anything really solid, essential, and eternal in the O. T., it belongs to Christ and to His Spirit;” Hofmann: “the body of the future <span class="ital">is there, where Christ is</span>, present and given with Him” (consequently as if <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span> were used).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">τὸ σῶμα</span> in contrast to <span class="greekheb">σκιά</span>, comp.

It is cast by the body, and therefore implies that there is a body, and while it resembles the body it is itself insubstantial. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μελλ</span>. means the Christian dispensation, not (as Mey.) the still future Messianic kingdom, for, if so, the substance would still lie in the future, and the shadow would not be out of date. It is future from the point of view of Judaism.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ δὲ σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>: “but the body belongs to Christ”. <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> is that which casts the shadow, therefore it existed contemporaneously with its manifestation, and, of course, according to the Jewish view, in heaven. It practically means what we should call “the substance,” and is chosen as the counterpart to <span class="greekheb">σκιὰ</span>, and with no reference to the Church or the glorified body of Christ.

The singular verb (literally, <span class="accented">is</span>) quite grammatically combines the particulars of ver. 16 under their common idea of a foreshadowing of the things of Christ; and the present tense affirms here a general truth, not a mere historical fact.
