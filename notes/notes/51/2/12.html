In the latter clause this Epistle is stronger. What in the earlier Epistle is the “likeness of His Resurrection” is here the participation of it, “Ye are risen with Him.” Similarly, instead of the simple allusion to “Christ’s being raised from the dead,” we have here “through faith in the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.” Here, as in the more detailed passage of the Ephesian Epistle (<a href="/context/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19-23</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5-7</a>), the “operation,” the energy of “the mighty power of God,” is conceived as actually working both in the Head and in the Body, so that wo through it partake of the resurrection, the ascension, and the glorified majesty of Christ. The comparison shows an instructive development in this Epistle of the consequences of the unity with Christ.<p>This passage is also notable for the obvious contrast of baptism, as a spiritual reality, with circumcision as a symbolic form. Each is the entrance into a covenant with God; but the one into a covenant of “the letter,” and the other into a covenant of “the spirit.” (See the contrast between the covenants drawn out in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6-18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>.) In the earlier Epistles circumcision is contrasted with spiritual regeneration (<a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>), as shown by various signs, such as “faith working by love” (<a href="/context/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9-12</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), or “keeping the commandments of God” (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>). Here this contrast is still as strong as ever; but baptism being (as always) looked upon as the means of such spiritual regeneration, is brought out emphatically as “the circumcision of the Spirit.” As baptised into Christ, “we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit” (<a href="/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Philippians 3:3</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Buried with him in baptism - See the notes at <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>.<p>Wherein also - In which ordinance, or by virtue of that which is signified by the ordinance.<p>Ye are risen with him - From the death of sin to the life of religion; Notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a>; compare the notes at <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5-6</a>.<p>Through the faith of the operation of God - By a firm belief on the agency of God in raising him up; that is, a belief of the fact that God has raised him from the dead. The resurrection of Christ is often represented as the foundation of all our hopes; and, as he was raised from the grave to die no more, so, in virtue of that we are raised from the death of sin to eternal spiritual life. The belief of this is shown by our baptism, whatever be the mode in which that ordinance is performed, and as well shown in one mode as another. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Translate, "Having been buried with Him in your baptism." The past participle is here coincident in time with the preceding verb, "ye were (Greek) circumcised." Baptism is regarded as the burial of the old carnal life, to which the act of immersion symbolically corresponds; and in warm climates where immersion is safe, it is the mode most accordant with the significance of the ordinance; but the spirit of the ordinance is kept by affusion, where immersion would be inconvenient or dangerous; to insist on literal immersion in all cases would be mere legal ceremonialism (Ro 6:3, 4).<p>are risen&#8212;rather as Greek, "were raised with Him."<p>through the faith, &c.&#8212;by means of your faith in the operation of God; so "faith of," for "faith in" (Eph 3:12; Php 3:9). Faith in God's mighty operation in raising again Jesus, is saving faith (Ro 4:24; 10:9); and it is wrought in the soul by His same "mighty working" whereby He "raised Jesus from the dead" (Eph 1:19, 20). Bengel seems to me (not as Alford understands him) to express the latter sense, namely, "Through the faith which is a work of the operation of God who," &c. Eph 1:19, 20 accords with this; the same mighty power of God is exercised in raising one spiritually dead to the life of faith, as was "wrought in Christ when God raised Him literally from the dead." However, "faith of" usually is "faith in" (Ro 3:22); but there is no grammatical impropriety in understanding it "the faith which is the effect of the operation of God" (Eph 2:8; 1Th 2:13). As His literal resurrection is the ground of the power put forth in our spiritual resurrection now, so it is a pledge of our literal resurrection hereafter (Ro 8:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Buried with him in baptism:</span> he shows that in Christ they who are found have not only the thing signified, but right to the outward sign and seal, viz. baptism, in the room of circumcision abolished; the death and burial of Christ is not only the exemplar, but the cause of the death of the old man, signed and sealed in baptism: or, <span class="ital">by baptism into death, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a>,4</span>, analogically, or symbolically, or sacramentally, when the Lord, together with the external sign, conferreth his grace signified by that sign; for even then the sins of such a one are buried with Christ so as they shall appear no more, either to his eternal condemnation, or in their former dominion, <span class="bld"><a href="/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>,9,14</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Wherein also ye are risen with him; </span> in or by which baptism becoming effectual, having mortified the body of sin, like as Christ was raised from the dead, ye are quickened and raised to <span class="ital">newness of life, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a> <a href="/context/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ....">Galatians 3:27-29</a> <a href="/ephesians/4-23.htm" title="And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;">Ephesians 4:23</a>,24 5:14,26,27 Col 3:10,11</span>.

And he specifieth faith rather than love or other graces which are wrought also by God, because in this grace, which is the constitutive part of the new creature, God comes in with a greater irradiation upon the soul, being it hath not one fragment or point of nature to stand upon; carnal reason and mere moral righteousness being opposite to it, whereas other graces are but as the rectifying of the passions, and setting them upon right objects. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/colossians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Buried with him in baptism,.... The apostle goes on to observe how complete and perfect the saints are in Christ; that they are not only circumcised in him in a spiritual sense, and the body of the sins of their flesh is put off, and removed from them, in allusion to the cutting off and casting away of the foreskin in circumcision; but that they and all their sins were buried with Christ, of which their baptism in water was a lively representation: Christ having died for their sins, was laid in the grave, where he continued for a while, and then rose again; and as they were crucified with him, they were also buried with him, as their head and representative; and all their sins too, which he left behind him in the grave, signified by his grave clothes there; and baptism being performed by immersion, when the person baptized is covered with water, and as it were buried in it, is a very significant emblem of all this; it is a representation of the burial of Christ, and very fitly holds him forth to the view of faith in the state of the dead, in the grave, and points out the place where the Lord lay; and it is also a representation of our burial with him, as being dead to sin, to the law, and to the world, by him. This shows now, that baptism was performed by dipping, or covering the whole body in water, for no other form of administration of baptism, as sprinkling, or pouring water on the face, can represent a burial, or be called one; and this is what many learned interpreters own, and observe on this place: <p>wherein also ye are risen with him; Christ is risen from the dead as the head and representative of his people, and they are risen with him; and their baptism is also an emblem of his and their resurrection, being administered by immersion, in which way only this can be signified; for as the going down into the water, and being under it, represents Christ's descending into the state of the dead, and his continuance in it, so the emersion, or coming up out of the water, represents his rising from the dead, and that of his people in him, in order to walk in newness of life; for the apostle's meaning is, that in baptism saints are risen with Christ, as well as in it buried with him: and this <p>through the faith of the operation of God; that is, it is through faith that saints see themselves buried and risen with Christ, to which the ordinance of baptism is greatly assisting, where there is true faith; for otherwise, without faith, this ordinance will be of no use to any such end and purpose; and it is not any faith that will avail, but that which is of God's operation; faith is not naturally in men, all men have it not; and those that have it, have it not of themselves, it is the gift of God; it is what be works in them, and by his power performs: <p>who hath raised him from the dead; this is a periphrasis of God the Father, to whom the resurrection of Christ from the dead is generally ascribed; though not to the exclusion of Christ, and of the Spirit, who were also concerned; and is here added, partly to show in what respect faith, which is God's work, has him for its object, as having raised Christ from the dead, who was delivered for offences, but is risen again through the power of God for justification, and whoever with his heart believes this shall be saved; and partly to show, that the same power is exerted in working true faith in the heart, as was put forth in raising Christ from the dead. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> Buried with <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> him in baptism, <span class="cverse3">{11}</span> wherein also ye are risen with <i>him</i> through the faith of the operation of <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> God, who hath raised him from the dead.</span><p>(10) The taking away of an objection: we do not need an external sign to the extent which our fathers had, seeing that our baptism is a most effectual pledge and witness, of that inward restoring and renewing.<p>(q) See Ro 6:4.<p>(r) So then all the force of the matter comes not from the very deed done, that is to say, it is not the dipping of us into the water by a minister that makes us to be buried with Christ, as the papists say, that even by the very act's sake we become very Christians, but it comes from the power of Christ, for the apostle adds the resurrection of Christ, and faith.<p>(11) One purpose of baptism is to symbolise the death and burial of the old man, and that by the mighty power of God alone, whose power we lay hold on by faith, in the death and resurrection of Christ.<p>(s) Through faith which comes from God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/colossians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a> supplies further information as to how the <span class="greekheb">περιετμήθητε</span>, so far as it has taken place by means of the circumcision <span class="ital">of Christ</span>, has been accomplished.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συνταφέντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] synchronous with <span class="greekheb">περιετμ</span>.

In the burial of Christ this joint burial of all that confess Him as respects their sinful body was objectively completed; but it takes place, as respects each individually and in subjective appropriation, by their baptism, prior to which the realization of that fellowship of burial was, on the part of individuals, still wanting.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καὶ συνηγέρθητε</span>] A new benefit, which has accrued to the readers <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span>, and which in their case must bring still more clearly to living consciousness their <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ πεπληρωμένον εἶναι</span>; so that <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> here is parallel to the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> in <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>, and refers to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, as does also <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span> subsequently. It is rightly taken thus, following Chrysostom and his successors, by Luther and most others, including Flatt, Bähr, Huther, Ewald. Others have referred it to <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ βαπτ</span>. (Beza, Calixtus, Estius, Michaelis, Heinrichs, and others, including Steiger, Böhmer, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Hofmann, Dalmer, Bleek); but, in opposition to this may be urged, first, the very symmetry of the discourse (<span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καί</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καί</span>); secondly, and specially, the fact that, if <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> refers to baptism, <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> could not be the proper preposition, since <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ βαπτ</span>., in accordance with the meaning of the word and the figure of burial, refers to the <span class="ital">dipping into</span> (not <span class="ital">overflowing</span>, as Hofmann thinks), whilst the spiritual awakening to new life, in which sense these expositors take <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθ</span>., would have taken place through the <span class="ital">emerging again</span>, so that we should expect <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ</span>, or, at all events, the non-local <span class="greekheb">διʼ οὗ</span>; and, thirdly, the fact that just as <span class="greekheb">συνταφέντες</span> has its own more precise definition by <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ βαπτ</span>., so also has <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθ</span>. through <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and therefore the text affords no occasion for taking up again for <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθ</span>. the more precise definition of the previous point, viz. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ βαπτίσματι</span>. No, the first benefit received in Christ which Paul specifies, viz. the moral circumcision, accomplished by God through the joint burial in baptismal immersion, has been fully handled in <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a> down to <span class="greekheb">βαπτίσματι</span> in <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>, and there now follows a second blessing received by the readers in Christ (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καί</span>): they have been <span class="ital">raised up also with Christ</span>, which has taken place <span class="ital">through faith</span>, etc. The previous joint burial was the necessary moral preliminary condition of this joint awakening, since through it the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τῆς σαρκός</span> was put off. This <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθ</span>. is to be understood in the sense of <span class="ital">the fellowship of the bodily resurrection of Christ</span>, into which fellowship man enters by faith in such a way that, in virtue of his union of life and destiny with Christ brought about by means of faith, he knows his own resurrection as having taken place in that of Christ—a benefit of joint resurrection, which is, indeed, prior to the Parousia, an <span class="ital">ideal</span> possession, but through the Parousia becomes <span class="ital">real</span> (whether its realization be attained by resurrection proper in the case of the dead, or by the change that shall take place in those who are still alive). Usually <span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθ</span>. is taken in the <span class="ital">ethical</span> sense, as referring to the <span class="ital">spiritual</span> awakening, viz. from moral death, so that Paul, after the <span class="ital">negative</span> aspect of the regeneration (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>; <span class="greekheb">βαπτίσματι</span>, <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>), now describes its <span class="ital">positive</span> character; comp. also Huther, Ewald, Bleek, Hofmann. But in opposition to this view is the fact that the fresh commencement <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καί</span>, corresponding with the similar commencement of <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>, and referring to Christ, makes us expect the mention of a <span class="ital">new benefit</span>, and not merely that of another aspect of the <span class="ital">previous</span> one, otherwise there would have been no necessity for repeating the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καί</span>; as also, that the inference of participation in the <span class="ital">proper</span> resurrection of Christ from death lies at the basis of the following <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν</span>. Comp. on <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)...">Ephesians 2:5-6</a>.

Groundlessly; Paul is describing the <span class="ital">subjective medium</span>, without which the joint awakening, though objectively and historically accomplished in the resurrection of Christ, would not be appropriated individually, the <span class="greekheb">ληπτικόν</span> for this appropriation being wanting. The unbeliever has not the blessing of having risen with Christ, because he stands apart from the fellowship of life with Christ, just as also he has not the reconciliation, although the reconciliation of all has been accomplished objectively through Christ’s death. The genitive <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐνεργείας τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. is the <span class="ital">object</span> of faith; so Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Castalio, Beza, Calvin, Zeger, Grotius, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, Michaelis, Rosenmüller, and others, including Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald, Bleek, and Hofmann, in the 2d ed. of the <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 174 f. But others, such as Luther (“through the faith <span class="ital">which God works</span>”), Bengel, Flatt, Bähr, Steiger, de Wette, Böhmer, Huther, <span class="ital">et al</span>., take <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐνεργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. as genitivus <span class="ital">causae</span>, for which, however, <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a> is not to be adduced (see <span class="ital">in loc</span>.), and in opposition to which it is decisive that in <span class="ital">all</span> passages, where the genitive with <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> is not the believing subject, it denotes the <span class="ital">object</span> (<a href="/mark/11-22.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God.">Mark 11:22</a>; <a href="/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a>; <a href="/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-22.htm" title="But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.">Galatians 3:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">Jam 2:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-12.htm" title="Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.">Revelation 14:12</a>), and that the description of God as the Being <span class="ital">who has raised up Christ from the dead</span> stands most naturally and directly in significant reference to the divine activity which procures, not the <span class="ital">faith</span>, but the <span class="greekheb">συνεγείρεσθαι</span>, and which is therefore set forth in a very appropriate manner as the special object[100] of faith (comp. 4:17, 24, 6:8, 10:9; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-13.htm" title="We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;...">2 Corinthians 4:13-14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a> f.; <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm" title="Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.">1 Peter 1:21</a>). At the basis, namely, of the <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ νεκρ</span>. lies the certainty in the believer’s consciousness: since God has raised up Christ, His activity, which has produced this <span class="ital">principale</span> and <span class="ital">majus</span>, will have included therein the <span class="ital">consequens</span> and <span class="ital">minus</span>, my <span class="ital">resurrection with Him</span>. To the believer the two stand in such essential connection, that in the operation of God which raised up Christ he beholds, by virtue of his fellowship of life with Christ, the assurance of his own resurrection having taken place along with that act; in the former he has the pledge, the <span class="greekheb">ἐνέχυρον</span> (Theodoret) of the latter. Hofmann now again (as in the first ed. of the <span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>) explains <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐνεργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. as in <span class="ital">apposition to</span> <span class="greekheb">τῆς πίστεως</span>, in such a way that Paul, “<span class="ital">as if correcting himself,</span>” makes the former take the place of the latter, in order to guard against the danger of his readers conceiving to themselves faith as a <span class="ital">conduct on man’s part</span> making possible the participation in the resurrection of Christ by God, while in reality it is nothing else than the product of the <span class="greekheb">ἐνέργεια</span> <span class="ital">of God</span>. A quite gratuitously invented self-correction, without precedent, and undiscoverable by the reader; although the thought, if it had entered the mind of Paul, might have been indicated with the utmost simplicity and ease (possibly by <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως</span>, <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον δὲ διὰ τῆς ἐνεργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[100] The efficacy of the divine power shown in the resurrection of Christ is the guarantee of the certainty of salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">συνταφέντες αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ βαπτισμῷ</span>. This refers to the personal experience of the Christian. The rite of baptism, in which the person baptised was first buried beneath the water and then raised from it, typified to Paul the burial and resurrection of the believer with Christ. Burial seems to imply a previous death, but <a href="/context/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?...">Romans 6:3-4</a> perhaps shows that the metaphors must not be rigidly pressed. <span class="greekheb">συνταφ</span>. is to be joined closely with <span class="greekheb">περιετμήθητε</span>. If any distinction in meaning is to be made between <span class="greekheb">βαπτισμός</span> and <span class="greekheb">βάπτισμα</span>, it is that the former expresses the process, the latter the result.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span> may refer either to <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. or to <span class="greekheb">βαπ</span>. The former view is taken by Chrysostom (followed by Luther, Meyer and many others). The latter is taken by Calvin and most recent commentators (De W., Hofm., Alf., Ell., Lightf., Kl[14], Sod., Haupt, Abb.). In favour of the former it is urged that the parallelism with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καὶ περιετμ</span>. requires it. But the real parallel is with “buried with Him in baptism,” and this requires “raised with Him in baptism”. Since baptism is not the mere plunging into the water, but emersion from it too, <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not against this interpretation, and <span class="greekheb">διά</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span> is not necessary to express it.—<span class="greekheb">συνηγέρθητε</span> expresses the positive side of the experience. That death with Christ, which is the putting off of the body of flesh, has for its counterpart the putting on of Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>), which is followed by a walk with Him in newness of life. It is true that our complete redemption is attained only in the resurrection of the body (<a href="/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>, <a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed on with our house which is from heaven:...">2 Corinthians 5:2-4</a>). But there is clearly no reference here to the bodily resurrection at the last day, as some have thought; for that is altogether excluded by the whole tenor of the passage, which refers to an experience already complete. Nor can we, with Meyer, think of the bodily resurrection as already ideally accomplished in baptism. For the preceding context speaks only of a spiritual experience, and it is impossible to pass thus violently to one that is physical. Haupt agrees with this, but thinks the reference is not ethical, but religious, that is forensic. The rest of the passage, he argues, shows that it is not moral transformation, but justification, that Paul has in mind. But however true this may be of <span class="greekheb">χαρισάμενος</span> … <span class="greekheb">σταυρῷ</span>, it is at least questionable for the immediately succeeding context. And since the union covers both ethical renewal and justification, it is natural to find both mentioned in connexion with it, and to hold fast the former here as the more natural interpretation of the words.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως τῆς ἐνεργείας</span>: “through faith in the working”. Klöpper (following Luth., Beng., De W. and others) makes <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐνερ</span>. genitive of cause, “faith produced by the working”. He argues that it is strange that in the experience already referred to the faith which proves itself in baptism must be thought of as directed towards the Person of Christ, and so cannot now be spoken of as faith in the working of God; and further, that the whole context has referred to a passive experience, and so this is fitly continued by the assertion that even the faith, which appropriates the death and resurrection of Christ, is the creation of God. But these arguments are insufficient to overthrow the force of Pauline usage, according to which elsewhere the genitive after <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, unless it refers to the person who believes, expresses the object of faith. The view of Hofmann that <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐνερ</span>. is a genitive of apposition, and that what is meant is “faith, that is the working of God,” is quite out of the question. For faith directed towards the working of God who raised Christ from the dead, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/romans/4-24.htm" title="But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;">Romans 4:24</a>. God is so characterised, since the working by which He raised Christ will also be effective in our own spiritual experience. Our baptism is therefore not a sign of nothing, but of a real spiritual burial and resurrection with Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[14] Klöpper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">buried with him</span>] Cp. <a href="/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>; the only parallel.—Union with Christ is primarily union with Him as the Dead and Buried, because His Death (consummated as it were and sealed in His Burial) is the procuring cause of all our blessings in Him, as it is our Propitiation and Peace. The Christian, joined to Him, shares as it were the atoning Death and the covering, swallowing, Grave of his blessed Representative; he goes to the depths of that awful process with and in his Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in baptism</span>] The form of the Greek word (<span class="ital">baptismos</span> not <span class="ital">baptisma</span> in the best reading) perhaps emphasizes the action rather than the abstract institution; it recalls the decisive “Rubicon” which his sacramental Washing was to the convert. See Lightfoot here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The immersion of the baptized (the primeval and ideal form of rite, but not invariable as a literal action; see <span class="ital">Teaching of the Apostles</span> (cent. 1), ch. 7) is undoubtedly here in view. The plunge beneath the water signified identification with the buried Lord, and sealed it to faith. Lightfoot quotes from the <span class="ital">Apostolic Constitutions</span> (a book heretical in doctrine but valuable as a witness to usages; cent. 3) the words (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>), “the plunge is our dying with Him, the coming up, our rising with Him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It must be said again (see above on <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>) that, in the ultimate reality, not the Sacrament but faith in God’s promises joins us to the Lord in His death. But the Sacrament so seals the faith that the terms appropriate to faith attach to the Sacrament, naturally though secondarily. Cp. <a href="/context/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus....">Galatians 3:26-27</a>, in the significant connexion of the verses.

(<a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter Lombard (<span class="ital">ob</span>. a.d. 1160), known among medieval theologians as “<span class="ital">the Master of the Sentences</span>” (<span class="ital">Magister Sententiarum</span>), or simply, “<span class="ital">the Master</span>,” writes as follows in his Treatise on Theology called <span class="ital">Sententiœ</span> (<span class="ital">Lib</span>. iv., <span class="ital">Distinctio</span> iv., §§ 3–7):<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is asked, how is that text to be received, <span class="ital">As many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ</span>.… In two manners are we said to put on Christ; by the taking of the Sacrament, or by the reception of the Thing (<span class="ital">Res</span>). So Augustine: ‘Men put on Christ sometimes so far as the reception of the Sacrament, sometimes so far as the sanctification of the life; and the first may be common to the good and the evil; the latter is peculiar to the good and pious.’ So all who are baptized in Christ’s name put on Christ either in the sense of (<span class="ital">secundum</span>) the reception of the Sacrament, or in that of sanctification of the life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Others there are … who receive the Thing and not the Sacrament … Not only does martyrdom (<span class="ital">passio</span>) do the work of baptism but also faith and contrition, where necessity excludes the Sacrament …<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Whether is greater, faith or water? Without doubt I answer, faith. Now if the lesser can sanctify, cannot the greater, even faith? of which Christ said, ‘He that believeth in me, even if he were dead, he shall live’ … [Augustine says,] ‘If any man having faith and love desires to be baptized, and cannot so be, because necessity intervenes, the kindness of the Almighty supplies what was lacking to the Sacrament … The duty which could not be done is not reckoned against him by God, who hath not tied (<span class="ital">alligavit</span>) His power to the Sacraments …’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The question is often asked, regarding those who, already sanctified by the Spirit, come with faith and love to baptism, what benefit baptism confers upon them? For it seems to give them nothing, since through faith and contrition their sins are already forgiven and they are justified. To which it may be truly replied that they are indeed … justified, i.e. purged from the stain (<span class="ital">macula</span>) of sin, and absolved from the debt of the eternal punishment, but that they are still held by the bond of the temporal satisfaction by which penitents are bound in the Church. Now when they receive Baptism they are both cleansed of any sins they have contracted since conversion, and are absolved from the external satisfaction; and assisting grace and all virtues are increased in them; so that the man may then truly be called new … Baptism confers much benefit even on the man already justified by faith; for, coming to it, he is now carried, like the branch by the dove, into the ark.

The great risk of such overstrained exposition is that it tends to exalt the Sacrament at the expense of adequate views of the Grace, and so to invert the scale and relation of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/colossians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Βαπτίσματι</span>, <span class="ital">in baptism</span>) As death is before the resurrection, so in this third or middle term of the comparison, baptism naturally precedes matured (full-grown) faith.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ</span>, <span class="ital">in which</span>) An Anaphora [the frequent repetition of the same words in the beginnings], comp. <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως τῆς ἐνεργείας τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>) A remarkable expression: <span class="ital">faith is of Divine operation</span>, and Divine working is in believers; <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - When ye were (literally, <span class="accented">having been</span>) buried with him in your baptism (ver. 20; <a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-11</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the rarer form of the word, is preferred by Tregelles, Alford, Lightfoot (see his note), being found in Codex B, with other good authorities; it indicates the process ("in your baptizing"). <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the usual form of the word, is retained by Revisers, after Tischendorf, Ellicott, Westcott and Herr. <span class="accented">Baptism</span> stands for the entire change of the man which it symbolizes and seals (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-5</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>).

In which (or, <span class="accented">whom</span>) also ye were raised with (him), through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6, 8</a>; <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24, 25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>). We refer the relative pronoun to the immediately antecedent "baptism," although the previous <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span> refers to "Christ" (ver. 11: comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>) and some good interpreters follow the rendering "in whom." For the Christian's <span class="accented">being raised with Christ</span> is not contrasted with his <span class="accented">circumcision</span> (ver. 11) - that figure has been dismissed - but with <span class="accented">his burial in baptism</span> (ver. 12 a); so Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Revisers. "Having been buried" is replaced in the antithesis by the more assertive "ye were raised" (comp. vers. 13, 14; <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 26</a>). "With" points to the "him" (Christ) of the previous clause (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). <span class="accented">Faith</span> is the instrumental cause of that which baptism sets forth (comp. <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>), and has for its object (not its cause: so Bengel) "the working" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see note, <a href="/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; also <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>) "of God." And the special Divine work on which it rests is "the resurrection of Christ" (<a href="/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24, 25</a>; <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13-17</a>): comp. note on "Firstborn out of the dead," <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>. Rising from the baptismal waters, the Christian convert declares the faith of his heart in that supreme act of God, which attests and makes sure all that he has bestowed upon us in his Son (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12-14</a>: comp. <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; also <a href="/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33, 38</a>, etc.). Baptism symbolizes all that circumcision did, and more. It expresses more fully than the older sacrament our parting with the life of sin; and also that of which circumcision knew nothing - the union of the man with the dying and risen Christ, which makes him "dead unto sin, and alive unto God." How needless, then, even if it were legitimate, for a Christian to return to this superseded rite! To heighten his readers' sense of the reality and completeness of the change which as baptized (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">believing</span>) Christians they bad undergone, he describes it now more directly as matter of personal experience. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Buried (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>.

The raising is not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ's second coming, but the moral resurrection to a new life. This corresponds with the drift of the entire passage, with the figurative sense of buried, and with <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>, which is decisive.<p>Through the faith of the operation of God<p>Not the faith which God works, but your faith in God's working: faith in God's energy as displayed in Christ's resurrection.
