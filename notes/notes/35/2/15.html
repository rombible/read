To give one drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, or ready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he may expose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a bad bargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty of this sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards the murder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishment answering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. The Lord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him in the way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship him in his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From cruelty the prophet goes on to denounce the woe on insolence. "Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor" (to whom he owes love) drink (literally, that maketh him drink); that puttest  thy bottle  to him, and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look (gaze with devilish pleasure) on their nakedness." This may either be of actual insults (as in the history of Noah), in keeping certainly with the character of the later Babylonians, the last wantonness of unbridled power, making vile sport of those like himself (his neighbor), or it may be drunkenness through misery <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a> wherein they are bared of all their glory and brought to the lowest shame.

Maurer, from a different Hebrew root, translates, "that pourest in thy wrath." English Version keeps up the metaphor better. It is not enough for thee to be "drunken" thyself, unless thou canst lead others into the same state. The thing meant is, that the Chaldean king, with his insatiable desires (a kind of intoxication), allured neighboring states into the same mad thirst for war to obtain booty, and then at last exposed them to loss and shame (compare Isa 51:17; Ob 16).

Before the full accomplishment of the above prophecy concerning the abundance of the knowledge of the Lord in the earth, and before the utter destruction of antichrist; between that and the Reformation, when it had its fulfilment in part; the following practices inveighed against would be used, as we find they are, and for which the man of sin and his followers will be punished: one of which is expressed by a man's "giving his neighbour drink"; which is a commendable action, when drink is given to a person in want to quench his thirst, or in sorrowful and distressed circumstances to refresh and cheer him; but when this is done to intoxicate him, and draw him into uncleanness, it is an evil one; and which is the sense of the phrase here, as appears by the "woe" denounced, and by what follows; and is to be understood, not in a literal sense, but in a figurative one; and is expressive of the various artful methods and alluring ways used by the Papists, especially the Jesuits, after the Reformation, with the Protestants, to forsake their religion, and to draw them into the superstition and idolatry of the church of Rome; and which are in the New Testament signified by "the wine of her fornication", with which the kings, nations, and inhabitants of the earth, are made drunk, <a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a> crying up the devotion and religion of their church, its antiquity, purity, holiness, and unity; pretending great love to the souls of men, that they seek nothing but their spiritual good; promising them great advantages, temporal and spiritual, worldly riches and honour, and sure and certain salvation within the pale of their church, without which they say there is none; and by such means they have intoxicated many princes, kingdoms, and multitudes of people, since the Reformation; and have drawn them off from the profession of the Protestant religion, and brought them back to Popery again, as in Poland, Bohemia, Hungary, Germany, France, and other places; and these methods they are now taking in all Protestant countries, and in ours, and that with great success, as is notorious, and time will more abundantly show; but there is a "woe" lies against them for it: <p>that puttest thy bottle to him; giving him not only a glass or cup at a time, but a whole bottle to drink off at once, in order to inebriate him. The word is by some translated "thy gall", or "thy poison" (k); which fitly enough expresses the poisonous doctrines of the church of Rome, which men insensibly imbibe, infused in her wine of fornication, or drink in through the alluring and ensnaring methods taken. It properly signifies "heat" or "wrath". The Targum is, <p>"that pours it with heat, that he may drink, and be inebriated.'' <p>The Syriac version is, <p>"woe to him that gives his neighbour to drink the dregs of fury.'' <p>The words may be truly rendered, "adding thy wrath" (l); that is, to the alluring and enticing methods before mentioned, adding menaces, wrathful words, and furious persecutions: and this the Papists do where they can; when good words and fair speeches will not prevail, and they can not gain over proselytes with flattery, deceit, and lying, they threaten them with racks and tortures, with prisons and galleys, and death itself in various shapes, to force men into their communion; and which they have put in execution in many places, in Bohemia, Hungary, and in France even to this day; and this is what in the New Testament is called "the wine of the wrath of her fornication", <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>, <p>and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! as Ham did on his father's nakedness when in such circumstances: all the above methods are taken in order to intoxicate them, deprive them of the use of their reason, as is the case of a drunken man; and so bring them to believe, with an implicit faith, as the church believes; to believe things contrary to reason; to give into the spiritual whoredom and idolatry of that church, as men when drunk are easily drawn into uncleanness; to cast off their profession of the true religion, as a garment is cast off, as men when drunk are apt to do; and particularly to reject the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ, which is the only robe to cover the nakedness of men, and receive the doctrine of merit and justification by works; in short, to apostatize wholly from the religion they have professed, and join in communion with the whore of Rome, that so they may look upon their apostasy, which is their nakedness, with the utmost pleasure and delight. <p>(k) "venenum tuum", Montanus; so some in Drusius, and R.

The helplessness of the nations before the power or the craft of the Chaldean and his contemptuous treatment of them when subject to him is represented under the figure of giving one to drink to intoxication and then making brutal merriment over the exposure of his nakedness (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm" title="And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.">Genesis 9:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">That puttest thy bottle to</span> him] As the text stands the verse reads: <span class="ital">Woe to him that giveth his neighbour drink, mixing therewith</span> (or, adding thereto) <span class="ital">thy wrath, and makest him drunken also</span>. The idea would be, not that the wrath was the drink, but only mixed with it or added to it (<a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in your house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-1.htm" title="For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall join to the house of Jacob.">Isaiah 14:1</a>). This is not natural. A.V. “bottle” (<a href="/genesis/21-14.htm" title="And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.">Genesis 21:14</a>) is in Heb. a word similar to “wrath,” and might be read if the vowel points were altered, but its use is quite improbable. The ancient “bottle,” being a wine-skin, would not suggest the figure. Wellh. makes the ingenious conjecture that the term “mixing,” or adding to, has arisen by accidental repetition of a letter, and that its true sense is “from the cup” (<a href="/zechariah/12-2.htm" title="Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.">Zechariah 12:2</a>)—Woe to him that giveth his neighbour drink from the cup of his (lit. thy) wrath, and makest him drunken also.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - &sect; 11. <span class="accented">The fourth woe: for base and degrading treatment of subject nations.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Not only do the Chaldeans oppress and pillage the peoples, but they expose them to the vilest derision and contumely.

The literal drunkenness of the Chaldeans is not the point here. <span class="cmt_word">That puttest thy bottle to him.</span> If this translation is received, the clause is merely a strengthened repetition of the preceding with a sudden change of person. But it may be rendered, "pouring out, or mixing, thy fury," or, as Jerome, "mittens fel suum," "adding thy poison thereto." This last version seems most suitable, introducing a kind of climax, the "poison" being some drug added to increase the intoxicating power. Thus: he gives his neighbour drink, and this drugged, and in the end makes him drunken also.

There seems to be an allusion to the case of Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>, etc.); but the figure is meant to show the abject state to which the conquered nations were reduced, when, prostrated by fraud and treachery, they were mocked and spurned and covered with ignominy (comp. <a href="/nahum/3-5.htm">Nahum 3:5, 11</a>). So the mystic Babylon is said to have made the nations drink of her cup (<a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the second strophe, Micah turns from the godless princes and judges to the prophets who lead the people astray, with whom he contrasts the true prophets and their ways. <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>.

And the seers will be ashamed, and the soothsayers blush, and all cover their beard, because (there is) no answer of God. <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>. But I, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of Jehovah, and with judgment and strength, to show to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin." As the first strophe attaches itself to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>, so does the second to <a href="/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>, carrying out still further what is there affirmed concerning the false prophets. Micah describes them as people who predict peace and prosperity for a morsel of bread, and thereby lead the people astray, setting before them prosperity and salvation, instead of preaching repentance to them, by charging them with their sins. Thus they became accomplices of the wicked rulers, with whom they are therefore classed in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, together with the wicked priests. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, leading astray (cf. <a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>) my people, namely, by failing to charge them with their sins, and preach repentance, as the true prophets do, and predicting prosperity for bread and payment. The words, "who bite with their teeth," are to be connected closely with the next clause, "and they preach peace," in the sense of "who preach peace if they can bite with their teeth," i.e., if they receive something to bite (or eat). This explanation, which has already been expressed by the Chaldee, is necessarily required by the antithesis, "but whoever puts nothing into their mouth," i.e., gives them nothing to eat, notwithstanding the fact that in other passages na&#770;shakh only signifies to bite, in the sense of to wound, and is the word generally applied to the bite of a snake (<a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8</a>). If, however, we understand the biting with the teeth as a figurative representation of the words of the prophets who always preach prosperity, and of the injury they do to the real welfare of the people (Ros., Casp., and others), the obvious antithesis of the two double clauses of <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a> is totally destroyed. The harsh expression, to "bite with the teeth," in the sense of "to eat," is perfectly in harmony with the harsh words of <a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a> and <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>. Qidde&#772;sh milcha&#770;ma&#770;h, to sanctify war, i.e., to preach a holy war (cf. <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>), or, in reality, to proclaim the vengeance of God. For this shall night and darkness burst upon them. Night and darkness denote primarily the calamity which would come upon the false prophets (unto you) in connection with the judgment (<a href="/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>). The sun which sets to them is the sun of salvation or prosperity (<a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>); and the day which becomes black over them is the day of judgment, which is darkness, and not light (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>). This calamity is heightened by the fact that they will then stand ashamed, because their own former prophecies are thereby proved to be lies, and fresh, true prophecies fail them, because God gives no answer. "Convicted by the result, they are thus utterly put to shame, because God does not help them out of their trouble by any word of revelation" (Hitzig). Bo&#772;sh, to be ashamed, when connected with cha&#770;phe&#772;r (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>., etc.), signifies to become pale with shame; cha&#770;phe&#772;r, to blush, with min causae, to denote the thing of which a man is ashamed. Qo&#772;sem&#305;&#772;m (diviners) alternates with cho&#772;z&#305;&#772;m (seers), because these false prophets had no visions of God, but only divinations out of their own hearts. &#8219;Ata&#770;h sa&#770;pha&#770;m: to cover the beard, i.e., to cover the face up to the nose, is a sign of mourning (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>), here of trouble and shame (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>), and is really equivalent to covering the head (<a href="/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a>; <a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>).
