Here we see that God does not approve of those mighty conquerors who ravage the world, or carry their arms into divers countries. Though he makes use of them for the wise purposes of his providence, in chastising or punishing the wicked, yet, amidst all the pomp of their victories, they are often hateful in his sight; and, while they are in the midst of their triumphs, he is preparing the sword to cut them off.

The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity! - Nebuchadnezzar  "encircled the inner city with three walls and the outer city also with three, all of burnt brick. And having fortified the city with wondrous works, and adorned the gates like temples, he built another palace near the palace of his fathers, surpassing it in height and its great magnificence." He seemed to strengthen the city, and to establish it by outward defenses. But it was built through cruelty to conquered nations, and especially God's people, and by oppression, against His holy Will. So there was an inward rottenness and decay in what seemed strong and majestic, and which imposed on the outward eye; it would not stand, but fell. Babylon, which had stood since the flood, being enlarged contrary to the eternal laws of God, fell in the reign of his son. Such is all empire and greatness, raised on the neglect of God's laws, by unlawful conquests, and by the toil and sweat and hard service of the poor. Its aggrandizement and seeming strength is its fall. Daniel's exhortation to Nebuchadnezzar <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>, "Redeem thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy on the poor," implies that oppressiveness had been one of his chief sins. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. buildeth a town with blood&#8212;namely, Babylon rebuilt and enlarged by blood-bought spoils (compare Da 4:30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whosoever he be that lays foundations in blood, is here threatened, and none so great as to keep Off the woe, deserved and menaced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A town, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">city</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With blood; </span> in the guilt and with the cruelty of murdering the innocents it is the worst cement which is tempered with blood of murdered men, women, and children. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And stablisheth; </span> goeth about or thinketh to establish the foundations of a city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A city; </span> Babylon in particular. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By iniquity; </span> by force and fraud, by riches extorted from the just possessor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Whosoever he be that lays foundations in blood, is here threatened, and none so great as to keep Off the woe, deserved and menaced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A town, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">city</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With blood; </span> in the guilt and with the cruelty of murdering the innocents it is the worst cement which is tempered with blood of murdered men, women, and children. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And stablisheth; </span> goeth about or thinketh to establish the foundations of a city. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A city; </span> Babylon in particular. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By iniquity; </span> by force and fraud, by riches extorted from the just possessor. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/habakkuk/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity! This is what the stone and beam should say, if others were silent. The town and city are the church of Rome, mystical Babylon, the great city, called spiritually Egypt and Sodom; the builder of this is the pope of Rome, the bishops of it in succession, who built it with blood: the pope of Rome received his title as head of the church from Phocas, that murdered the emperor Mauritius; the foundation of the church of Rome is the blood of the saints, shed in persecutions and wars; hence she is said to be drunk with the blood of them, and to have the blood of prophets and saints found in her, <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a> and it is established by unjust exactions of tribute from all countries subject to it, and by indulgences, processions, and various methods taken to extort money from the people, to support its pageantry, pomp, and grandeur; but there is a "woe" denounced against such that are concerned herein, and which will take place in due time, nor can it be awarded, as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/habakkuk/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/habakkuk/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12–14</span>.

Comp. <a href="/micah/3-10.htm" title="They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.">Micah 3:10</a>, “They build up Zion with blood,” i.e. by the goods of those slain by judicial murder (1 Kings 21).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by iniquity</span>] Cf. <a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13</a>, where the iniquity consists in the forced labour; here it may be more general. The terms “town” and “city” refer to any city or to many. <a href="/isaiah/14-21.htm" title="Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.">Isaiah 14:21</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - &sect; 10. <span class="accented">The third woe: for founding their power in blood and devastation.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The Chaldeans are denounced for the use they make of the wealth acquired by violence. <span class="cmt_word">That buildeth a town with blood</span> (<a href="/micah/3.htm">Micah 3</a>:19, where see note). They used the riches gained by the murder of conquered nations in enlarging and beautifying their own city. <span class="cmt_word">By iniquity.</span> To get means for these buildings, and to carry on their construction, they used injustice and tyranny of every kind. That mercy was not an attribute of Nebuchadnezzar we learn from Daniel's advice to him (<a href="/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>). The captives and deported inhabitants of conquered countries were used as slaves in these public works (see an illustration of this from Koyunjik, Rawlinson's 'Anc. Men.,' 1:497). What was true of Assyria was no less true of Babylon. Professor Rawlinson (2:528, etc.) tells of the extreme misery and almost entire ruin of subject kingdoms. Not only are lands wasted, cattle and effects carried off, the people punished by the beheading or impalement of hundreds or thousands, but sometimes wholesale deportation of the inhabitants is practised, tons or hundreds of thousands being carried away captive. "The military successes of the Babylonians," he says (3:332), "were accompanied with needless violence, and with outrages not unusual in the East, which the historian must nevertheless regard as at once crimes and follies. The transplantation of conquered races may, perhaps, have been morally defensible, notwithstanding the sufferings which it involved. But the mutilations of prisoners, the weary imprisonments, the massacre of non-combatants, the refinement of cruelty shown in the execution of children before the eyes of their fathers, - these and similar atrocities, which are recorded of the Babylonians, are wholly without excuse, since they did not so much terrify as exasperate the conquered nations, and thus rather endangered than added strength or security to the empire. A savage and inhuman temper is betrayed by these harsh punishments, one that led its possessors to sacrifice interest to vengeance, and the peace of a kingdom to a tiger-like thirst for blood...we cannot be surprised that, when final judgment was denounced against Babylon, it was declared to be sent in a great measure 'because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwelt therein.'" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>First strophe. - <a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>. "And I said, Hear ye, O heads of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know the right? <a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>. Ye who hate good, and love evil; who draw off their skin from them, and their flesh from their bones. <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>. And who have eaten the flesh of my people, and stripped off their skin from them; and broken their bones, and cut them in pieces, as if in the pot, and like flesh in the midst of the caldron. <a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>. Then will they cry to Jehovah, and He will not hearken; and let Him hide His face from them at the same time, as they have made their actions evil." By the expression "And I said" (va&#770;'o&#772;mar), the following address is indicated as a continuation of the preceding one. The reproofs of this chapter are also a still further expansion of the woe pronounced in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a> upon the godless chiefs of the nation. The heads of Jacob are addressed, that is to say, the princes of the tribes and families of Israel, and the qets&#305;&#772;n&#305;&#772;m, lit., deciders (answering to the Arabic qa&#770;d&#803;y, a judge) of the house of Israel, i.e., the heads of families and households, upon whom the administration of justice devolved (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, is it not your duty and your office to know justice? Da&#8219;ath is practical knowledge, which manifests itself in practice; mishpa&#770;t, the public administration of justice. Instead of this, they do the opposite. The description of this conduct is appended by participles, in the form of apposition to the heads and princes addressed in <a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>. Hating good and loving evil refer to the disposition, and indicate the radical corruption of these men. &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, generally misfortune, here evil; hence the Masoretes have altered it into &#1512;&#1506;; but the very fact that it deviates from the ordinary rule shows that it is the original word. Instead of administering justice to the people, they take off their skin, and tear the flesh from the bones. The suffixes attached to &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; point back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; in <a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>. The words answer to the German expression, "to pull the skin over the ears." In <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a> the expression is still stronger; but the address is continued in the form of a simple description, and instead of the participles, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is used with the finite verb. They not only flay the people, i.e., rob them of all their means of subsistence, but even devour them - treat them like cattle, which men first of all flay, then break their bones, but the flesh into pieces, and boil it in the pot. In this figure, which is carried out into the most minute details, we must not give any special meaning to the particular features, such as that "the skin, and boiling portions, which are cut up and put into the pot, are figures signifying the pledged clothing and coveted fields (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>, <a href="/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>)." The prophet paints in very glaring colours, to make an impression upon the ungodly. Therefore, in the time of judgment, God will not hear their crying to Him for help, but will hide His face from them, i.e., withdraw His mercy from them. &#1488;&#1494; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; point back to the evil time announced in <a href="/micah/2-3.htm">Micah 2:3</a>. For <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>, compare <a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>. Veyaste&#772;r in <a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a> is an optative. The prophet continues the announcement of the punishment in the form of a desire. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as  equals  according to the way in which, as in <a href="/1_samuel/28-18.htm">1 Samuel 28:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>, etc., i.e., answering to their evil doings. </body></html>
