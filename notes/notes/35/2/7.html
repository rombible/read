The expression, <span class="ital">rise up suddenly,</span> very fitly describes the suddenness with which the Babylonian empire was afterward overthrown. For though Cyrus could not be said to come upon them suddenly, or unexpectedly, yet the blow, whereby the Babylonian empire was overturned, was struck extremely suddenly; for, after all Cyrus’s victories, they thought themselves very secure within the walls of Babylon; and that Cyrus must be wearied out, and his army mouldered away, before he could make himself master of it: but by an unexpected stratagem, in draining the Euphrates, he got possession of the city, and destroyed the king and all his principal men in a few hours time: see notes on <a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm" title="It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelled in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.">Isaiah 13:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-38.htm" title="A drought is on her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad on their idols.">Jeremiah 50:38</a>; and <a href="/daniel/5-30.htm" title="In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.">Daniel 5:30</a>. <span class="ital">Because, </span>&c. — The prophet proceeds to give an account of the reasons on which divine vengeance proceeded in this affair. <span class="ital">Thou hast spoiled many nations —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hast slain or led captive their people, destroyed their cities, robbed their treasuries, deposed their kings; and hast done this to many nations, whose cry for vengeance is come up to heaven. <span class="ital">All the remnant of the people shall spoil thee — </span>Now shalt thou be paid in thine own coin: the remnant of the nations, unspoiled by thee, shall combine against thee, and execute the Lord’s just sentence upon thee.

The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall not they rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee? - The destruction of the wicked is ever sudden at last.

If there were a man, walking after wind, who would lie deceit, 'I will prophesy to thee of wine and strong drink,' he would be a prophet of this people." The prophet having overthrown in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7-9</a> the objection to his threatening prophecies, by pointing to the sins of the people, now repeats the announcement of punishment, and that in the form of a summons to go out of the land into captivity, because the land cannot bear the defilement consequent upon such abominations. The passage is based upon the idea contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-25.htm">Leviticus 18:25</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>, that the land is defiled by the sins of its inhabitants, and will vomit them out because of this defilement, in connection with such passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-9.htm">Deuteronomy 12:9-10</a>, where coming to Canaan is described as coming to rest. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; (this) refers to the land.

If "this" were to be taken as referring to their sinful conduct, in the sense of "this does not bring or cause rest," it would be difficult to connect it with what follows, viz., "because of the defilement;" whereas no difficulty arises if we take "this" as referring to the land, which the expression "rise up and go" naturally suggests. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;  equals  &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1492;, defilement; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; is to be taken in a relative sense, "which brings destruction," and is strengthened by &#1500;&#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, with an explanatory &#1493;: and indeed terrible destruction. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, perditio; and &#1504;&#1502;&#1512;&#1509; as in <a href="/1_kings/2-8.htm">1 Kings 2:8</a>.

Such prophecies are very unwelcome to the corrupt great men, because they do not want to hear the truth, but simply what flatters their wicked heart. They would like to have only prophets who prophesy lies to them. &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, walking after the wind; the construction is the same as &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>, and ru&#772;a&#774;ch is a figure signifying what is vain or worthless, as in <a href="/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a>, etc. The words &#1488;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; &#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; are the words of a false prophet: I prophesy to thee with regard to wine. The meaning is not "that there will be an abundant supply of wine," or "that the wine will turn out well" (Rosenmller and others); but wine and strong drink (for she&#772;kha&#770;r, see Delitzsch on <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>) are figures used to denote earthly blessings and sensual enjoyments, and the words refer to such promises as <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4-5</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/26-10.htm">Leviticus 26:10</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-11.htm">Deuteronomy 28:11</a>, <a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>; <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>., which false prophets held out to the people without any regard to their attitude towards God. "This people," because the great men represent the nation. With this explanation pointing back to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>, the threatening is brought to a close. </body></html>
