To give one drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, or ready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he may expose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a bad bargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty of this sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards the murder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishment answering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. The Lord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him in the way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship him in his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And now having declared the nothingness of all which is not God, the power of man or his gods, he answers again his own question, by summoning all before the presence of the majesty of God.<p>But the Lord - He had, in condemning them, pictured the tumult of the world, the oppressions, the violence, bloodsheddings, covetousness, insolence, self-aggrandizement of the then world-empire, and had denounced woe upon it; we see man framing his idols, praying to the lifeless stones; and God, of whom none thought, where was He? These were people's ways. "But the Lord," he joins it on, as the complement and corrective of all this confusion.<p>The Lord is in His holy temple - awaiting, in His long-suffering, to judge. "The temple of God" is where God enshrines Himself, or allows Himself to be seen and adored. "God is wholly everywhere, the whole of Him no where." There is no contrast between His temple on earth, and His temple in heaven. He is not more locally present in heaven than in earth. It were as anthropomorphic but less pious to think of God, as confined, localized, in heaven as on earth; because it would be simply removing God away from man.

The simple words are identical though not in the same order as those, in which David, in the same contrast with the oppression of man, ushers in the judgment and final retribution to good and bad, by declaring the unseen presence of God upon His Throne in heaven, beholding and testing the sons of men.<p>In His Presence, all the mysteries of our being are solved.<p>The Lord is in His holy Temple - not, as the idols in temples made with hands, but revealing Himself in the visible temple (Jerome), "dwelling in the Son, by Nature and Union, as He saith <a href="//biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>, "The Father who dwelleth in Me doeth the works;" in each one of the bodies and souls of the saints by His Spirit <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>, in the Blessed, in glory; in the Heavens, by the more evident appearance of His Majesty and the workings of His Power ; "everywhere by Essence, Presence, and Power, 'for in Him we live, and move, and have our being;' nowhere as confined or inclosed." Since then God is in Heaven, beholding the deeds of people, Himself Unchangeable, Almighty, All-holy, "let all the earth keep silence before Him," literally, "hush before Him all the earth," waiting from Him in hushed stillness the issue of this tangled state of being.

Not in graven and molten images; not in idols of wood and stone, covered with gold and silver; but in heaven, the habitation of his holiness, the place of his residence, where he is seen and worshipped by the holy angels and glorified saints; and from whence he surveys all the children of men, and their actions; observes the folly and stupidity of idol worshippers; and hears and answers the prayers of his own people: or this intends his church, which is his temple, sanctified by him, and set apart for his service, worship, and glory: here he grants his gracious presence to those who worship him in spirit and in truth; and here he will appear as King of saints, in a most glorious manner, when these several woes before mentioned have taken place; as on Rome Pagan already, and in part on Rome Papal at the Reformation, so completely on it, and all worshippers of images hereafter. The word  here used, signifies that part of the temple, called the holy place, as distinct from the holy of holies; which was the proper seat of the divine Majesty, and a figure of heaven, as the holy place was of the church; and so he was, as it were, removed from the one to the other; hence the more observable and remarkable, and the greater reason for what follows; and this serves to illustrate and confirm the sense given: <p>let all the earth keep silence before him; stand in awe of him, and reverence him; be subject to him, and silently adore him; as all the inhabitants of the earth will when the above enemies of his are entirely removed out of it; there will be no more clamours and objections against the Christian religion by Jews and Mahometans, on account of image worship, which will be no more; no more wars, or rumours of wars, but a profound peace everywhere; no more persecutions of the saints; no more will be heard the cry of violence and oppression, all their enemies being destroyed; no more repining and murmurings among the people of God, through impatience and unbelief, all afflictions being at an end; there will be an entire silence of this kind everywhere; only the voice of the Gospel, prayer, praise, and thanksgiving, will be heard. This is not the case now, nor was there ever as yet such a time on earth; this shows that the prophecy regards time to come. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/habakkuk/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/habakkuk/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>.

Building Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with wickedness. <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>. Their heads, they judge for reward; and their priests, they teach for hire; and their prophets, they divine for money, and lean upon Jehovah, saying, Is not Jehovah among us? evil will not come upon us." With the words "Hear this, I pray," the address returns to its starting-point in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>, but only to announce to the leaders of the people the threat of punishment for which the way has been prepared by <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2-7</a>. To this end their God-forgetting conduct is briefly summed up once more in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>, <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>. The summons to hear is really attached to the end of <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>. They are to hear the sin of Jacob (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9-11</a>); but they are also to hear the punishment for their sin, to which the word "this" points. The civil rulers only are addressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a>, - namely, those who were charged with the administration of justice and of the affairs of the state, but who did the very opposite, who abhorred justice, and made the straight crooked, because they passed sentence for bribes (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>). They thereby build Zion with blood, etc., i.e., obtain the means of erecting splendid buildings by cruel extortions, and partly also by actual judicial murders, as Ahab (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a> compared with <a href="/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>), and after him Jehoiakim, had done (<a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-17</a>). The Chaldeans built with blood in a different sense (<a href="/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>). The participle bo&#772;neh (building) is also in apposition to ra&#770;'she&#772; be&#772;th (heads of the house, etc.), and the singular without the article is to be taken collectively. They do not, however, truly build the city by this, they simply labour for its destruction (<a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>). But before saying this, Micah once more sums up briefly all the sins of the leading ranks. The teaching of the priests for reward refers to the fact that they had to give instruction as to the ritual requirements of the law, and were to do this gratuitously (cf. <a href="/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>), and that in disputed cases the judges were to pronounce sentence accordingly. At the same time, these men (not the prophets merely, but also the priests and the heads of the nation as the administrators of justice) placed their reliance upon Jehovah, upon the assurance that He was in the midst of them enthroned in His temple at Jerusalem, and that He would protect the city and its inhabitants from misfortune, without ever reflecting that Jehovah as the Holy One demands sanctification of life, and exterminates the sinners out of His people. </body></html>
