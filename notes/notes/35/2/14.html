The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord - Habakkuk modifies in a degree the words of Isaiah which he embodies, marking that the destruction of Babylon was a stage only toward the coming of those good things which God taught His people to long for, not their very coming. All the world should be then full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, not, as yet, wholly of Himself Jerome: "When Babylon shall be overthrown, then shall the power of the might of the Lord be known unto all. So shall the whole earth be filled with the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the bottom of the sea. This as to the letter. But it is plain, that the Devil also and antichrist, and the perverse teaching of heretics, built a city in blood; i. e, their own Church, with the destruction of those whom they deceive ... But when they fail in the fire (either this fire which is felt, or consumed in the fire of the devil their prince, or burned up with the fire whereof the Lord says, 'I came to send a fire upon the earth,' and so brought back from their former course, and doing penitence), the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, when, at the preaching of the apostles, their 'sound shall go out into all the world,' as waters covering the sea, i. e., all the saltness and bitterness of the world which Satan had rained down and the earth had drunk, the waters of the Lord shall cover, and cause the place of their ancient bitterness not to appear."<p>Rup.: "'For the Spirit of the Lord filled the earth,' and when He filled it, 'the earth was filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord,' so that unlearned and ignorant men became wise and eloquent, and earthly became heavenly, yea, they who were earth became heaven, knowing the glory of the Lord, declaring the glory of God, not any how, but as waters cover the sea. Great as must be waters, which would cover the sea, or compared to which the sea were nothing, far greater is the miracle, when the abundance of heavenly wisdom, given to the simple, surpassed the sea, i. e., the wisdom of all mankind." This verse being already a received image of the spread of the gospel <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>, it would of itself be understood to include this also; but more generally, it declares how upon all the judgments of God, a larger knowledge of Him would follow Cyril: "All things are full of Christ, who is the Glory of the Father; wherefore also He said <a href="//biblehub.com/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>, I have glorified Thee on earth, I have finished the work which Thou gavest me to do." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ; of the glory of his person, as the Son of God, and truly God; which is essential to him, and underived; the same with his Father's, and what transcends the glory of all created beings; and of the glory of his office as Mediator, which itself is glorious and honourable: and this his glory lies in his fitness for it; in his faithful performance of it, and the honour given him by his Father upon it; as well as in the fulness of grace in him, which makes him appear glorious to his people; and who are continually giving glory to him as the Lord their righteousness, by exercising faith on his righteousness, and glorying in it; and as their only Saviour and Redeemer, by looking to him, and believing in him as such; and as the only Head of the church, by owning and holding to him; and as the only Mediator between God and man, by making use of him for that purpose, and not angels and saints; and as their Prophet, by hearkening to his voice, yielding a subjection to his Gospel, and submission to his ordinances; and as their Priest, by dealing with his blood and sacrifice for the atonement and pardon of their sins; and as their King, by obedience to his commands; and who will now take to himself his great power, and reign gloriously before his saints; the glory of his kingly office will be now seen and known, when this prophecy shall have its full accomplishment, and which seems greatly intended. The "knowledge" of all this glory will not be a mere notional and speculative one, but special and spiritual; an experimental knowledge, accompanied with affection, approbation, confidence, and appropriation: and "the earth will be filled with" this; that is, the inhabitants of it: this had an accomplishment in part in the times of the apostles, when they were sent into all the world to preach the Gospel to every creature, and diffused the savour of the knowledge of Christ everywhere; and had a further accomplishment in the times of Constantine, when the whole Roman empire, or all the world, became Christians; and again at the time of the Reformation, when many nations, especially in Europe, were freed from Popish darkness by the pure light of the Gospel; but will have its final accomplishment in the latter day; and which will bring on the destruction of antichrist, and seems here intended; since this is given as a reason why it will be all labour in vain to attempt the prevention of it. It will be by means of the Gospel spreading the knowledge of Christ everywhere that antichrist will fall; this is the brightness of Christ's coming, with which he will be destroyed; hence the angel, with the everlasting Gospel to preach to all nations, and with whose glory the whole earth will be lightened, is represented as preceding the fall of Babylon, and as the means of it; see <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a> and the great spread and large abundance of this knowledge communicated by the preaching of the Gospel is thus illustrated and exemplified, <p>as the waters cover the sea; expressing the nature of Gospel doctrines, revealing the glory of Christ and his grace, which, like waters, refresh and make fruitful; and the force and power of them, bearing down all before them, like an inundation of water when it breaks its banks; and likewise the depths of them, these being the deep things of God; and more especially the general spread and large abundance of them, and of the knowledge conveyed by them; which will fill the earth, as the waters of the sea fill up and cover the vast chasm prepared for them; see  <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/habakkuk/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the earth shall <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</span><p>(l) In the destruction of the Babylonians his glory will appear through all the world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/habakkuk/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">As the waters cover</span>] Or, <span class="bld">like the waters which cover the</span> (bed of the) <span class="bld">sea</span>.

The verse explains the preceding. The Lord of Hosts, God Omnipotent, whose purposes overrule all, shall bring in His kingdom, and in the judgments that precede its coming the great fabrics reared by heathenism for its idolatries and its oppressions shall become fuel for the fire (<a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.">Isaiah 9:5</a>). This is the line of thought most natural. Another might be that when the reign of peace in Jehovah’s kingdom shall come in men themselves shall burn to the ground their strongholds of war and their edifices of pride, just as they shall beat their swords to ploughshares (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm" title="And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.">Isaiah 2:4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The prophet now gives the reason of the vanity of these human undertakings. <span class="cmt_word">For the earth shall be filled,</span> etc. The words are from <a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>, with some little alterations (comp. <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>). This is cue of the passages which attests "the community of testimony," as it is called, among the prophets. To take a few out of many cases that offer, <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> compared with <a href="/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a> with <a href="/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>, etc.; <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> with <a href="/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a> with <a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a> with <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a> (Ladd, 'Doctrine of Scripture,' 1:145). All the earth is to be filled with, and to recognize, the glory of God as manifested in the overthrow of ungodliness; and therefore Babylon, and the world power of which she is a type, must be subdued and perish. This announcement looks forward to the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which "shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and shall stand forever" (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). We must remember how intimately in the minds of Eastern heathens the prosperity of a nation was connected with its local deities. Nothing in their eyes could show more perfectly the impotence of a god than his failing to protect his worshippers from destruction (comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33</a>, etc.). The glory of Jehovah and his sovereignty over the earth would be seen and acknowledged in the overthrow of Babylon, the powerful, victorious nation. As the waters cover the sea. As the waters fill the basin of the sea (<a href="/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a>, where the great vessel of ablution is called "the sea"). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the second strophe, Micah turns from the godless princes and judges to the prophets who lead the people astray, with whom he contrasts the true prophets and their ways. <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>. Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth, and preach peace; and whoever should put nothing into their mouths, against him they sanctify war. <a href="/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>. Therefore night to you because of the visions, and darkness to you because of the soothsaying! and the sun will set over the prophets, and the day blacken itself over them. <a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>. And the seers will be ashamed, and the soothsayers blush, and all cover their beard, because (there is) no answer of God. <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>. But I, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of Jehovah, and with judgment and strength, to show to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin." As the first strophe attaches itself to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>, so does the second to <a href="/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>, carrying out still further what is there affirmed concerning the false prophets. Micah describes them as people who predict peace and prosperity for a morsel of bread, and thereby lead the people astray, setting before them prosperity and salvation, instead of preaching repentance to them, by charging them with their sins. Thus they became accomplices of the wicked rulers, with whom they are therefore classed in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, together with the wicked priests. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, leading astray (cf. <a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>) my people, namely, by failing to charge them with their sins, and preach repentance, as the true prophets do, and predicting prosperity for bread and payment. The words, "who bite with their teeth," are to be connected closely with the next clause, "and they preach peace," in the sense of "who preach peace if they can bite with their teeth," i.e., if they receive something to bite (or eat). This explanation, which has already been expressed by the Chaldee, is necessarily required by the antithesis, "but whoever puts nothing into their mouth," i.e., gives them nothing to eat, notwithstanding the fact that in other passages na&#770;shakh only signifies to bite, in the sense of to wound, and is the word generally applied to the bite of a snake (<a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8</a>). If, however, we understand the biting with the teeth as a figurative representation of the words of the prophets who always preach prosperity, and of the injury they do to the real welfare of the people (Ros., Casp., and others), the obvious antithesis of the two double clauses of <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a> is totally destroyed. The harsh expression, to "bite with the teeth," in the sense of "to eat," is perfectly in harmony with the harsh words of <a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a> and <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>. Qidde&#772;sh milcha&#770;ma&#770;h, to sanctify war, i.e., to preach a holy war (cf. <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>), or, in reality, to proclaim the vengeance of God. For this shall night and darkness burst upon them. Night and darkness denote primarily the calamity which would come upon the false prophets (unto you) in connection with the judgment (<a href="/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>). The sun which sets to them is the sun of salvation or prosperity (<a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>); and the day which becomes black over them is the day of judgment, which is darkness, and not light (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>). This calamity is heightened by the fact that they will then stand ashamed, because their own former prophecies are thereby proved to be lies, and fresh, true prophecies fail them, because God gives no answer. "Convicted by the result, they are thus utterly put to shame, because God does not help them out of their trouble by any word of revelation" (Hitzig). Bo&#772;sh, to be ashamed, when connected with cha&#770;phe&#772;r (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>., etc.), signifies to become pale with shame; cha&#770;phe&#772;r, to blush, with min causae, to denote the thing of which a man is ashamed. Qo&#772;sem&#305;&#772;m (diviners) alternates with cho&#772;z&#305;&#772;m (seers), because these false prophets had no visions of God, but only divinations out of their own hearts. &#8219;Ata&#770;h sa&#770;pha&#770;m: to cover the beard, i.e., to cover the face up to the nose, is a sign of mourning (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>), here of trouble and shame (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>), and is really equivalent to covering the head (<a href="/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a>; <a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>). Ma&#8219;a&#774;ne&#772;h, the construct state of the substantive, but in the sense of the participle; some codd. have indeed &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;. In <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a> Micah contrasts himself and his own doings with these false prophets, as being filled with power by the Spirit of Jehovah (i.e., through His assistance) and with judgment. Mishpa&#770;t, governed by &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, is the divine justice which the prophet has to proclaim, and gebhu&#772;ra&#770;h strength, manliness, to hold up before the people their sins and the justice of God. In this divine strength he can and must declare their unrighteousness to all ranks of the people, and predict the punishment of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9-12</a>). </body></html>
