To give one drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, or ready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he may expose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a bad bargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty of this sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards the murder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishment answering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. The Lord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him in the way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship him in his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the violence of Lebanon - i. e., done to Lebanon, whether the land of Israel of which it was the entrance and the beauty (See <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>, and, as a symbol, <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-23.htm">Jeremiah 22:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>; but it is used as a symbol of Sennacherib's army, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>, and the king of Asshur is not indeed spoken of under the name as a symbol (in <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>,) but is compared to it), or the temple (See the note at <a href="/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>), both of which Nebuchadnezzar laid waste; or, more widely, it may be a symbol of all the majesty of the world and its empires, which he subdues, as Isaiah uses it, when speaking of the judgment on the world, <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>, "It shall cover thee, and the spoil (i. e., spoiling, destruction) of beasts (the inhabitants of Lebanon) which made them afraid," or more simply, "the wasting of wild beasts  shall crush , <a href="/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-7.htm">Proverbs 18:7</a>) them (selves)," i. e., as it is in irrational nature, that "the frequency of the incursions of very mischievous animals becomes the cause that people assemble against them and kill them, so their (the Chaldaeans') frequent injustice is the cause that they haste to be avenged on thee" .<p>Having become beasts, they shared their history. They spoiled, scared, laid waste, were destroyed. "Whoso seeketh to hurt another, hurteth himself." The Chaldaeans laid waste Judea, scared and wasted its inhabitants; the end of its plunder should be, not to adorn, but to cover them, overwhelm them as in ruins, so that they should not lift up their heads again. Violence returns upon the head of him who did it; they seem to raise a lofty fabric, but are buried under it.

But it seems inappropriate to compare the elect people to "beasts." I therefore prefer explaining, "the spoiling of beasts," that is, such as is inflicted on beasts caught in a net, and "which makes them afraid (shall cover thee)." Thus the Babylonians are compared to wild beasts terrified at being caught suddenly in a net. In cruel rapacity they resembled wild beasts. The ancients read, "the spoiling of wild beasts shall make THEE afraid." Or else explain, "the spoiling of beasts (the Medes and Persians) which (inflicted by thee) made them afraid (shall in turn cover thyself&#8212;revert on thyself from them)."

Lebanon is not a figure for the holy land, but used literally. Both Assyrians and Babylonians transported wood from Lebanon for their temples and other edifices. It is possible that their cutting down of wood may have been wanton, and perhaps the use of the cedars by the Chaldean in any form may have been considered desecration. Comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-8.htm" title="Yes, the fir trees rejoice at you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since you are laid down, no feller is come up against us.">Isaiah 14:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall cover thee</span>] <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.">Obadiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-25.htm" title="We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.">Jeremiah 3:25</a>.

The ancient versions read <span class="ital">thee</span> for <span class="ital">them</span>, no doubt rightly. The Chaldeans may have made Lebanon their hunting-ground, and possibly they carried the chase to excess, though “spoil” or destruction does not mean extermination but violent treatment. The earth, the woods and the beasts no less than man have rights; there is nothing that exists which is not moral; wanton excess on anything recoils on the head of the perpetrator. The ravage and terror carried into the world of creatures shall come back in terror and destruction on the Chaldean. The refrain is as in <span class="ital"><a href="/habakkuk/2-11.htm" title="For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.">Habakkuk 2:11</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <span class="accented">iniquitas Libani</span> (Vulgate). It would be plainer if translated, "the violence against," or "practised on, Lebanon," as the sentence refers to the devastation inflicted by the Chaldeans on the forests of Lebanon (comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>). Jerome confines the expression in the text to the demolition of the temple at Jerusalem in the construction of which much cedar was employed; others take Lebanon as a figure for Palestine generally, or for Jerusalem itself; but it is best understood literally. The same devastation which the Chaldeans made in Lebanon shall "cover," overwhelm, and destroy them. <span class="cmt_word">And the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid.</span> The introduction of the relative is not required, and the passage may be better translated, <span class="accented">And the destruction of beasts made them</span> (others read "thee") <span class="accented">afraid.</span> Septuagint, "And the wretchedness of the beasts shall affright thee." Jerome, in his commentary, renders, "Et vastitas animalium opprimet te." The meaning is that the wholesale destruction of the wild animals of Lebanon, occasioned by the operations of the Chaldeans, shall be visited upon this people. They warred not only against men, but against the lower creatures too; and for this retributive punishment awaited them. <span class="cmt_word">Because of men's blood,</span> etc. The reason rendered in ver. 8 is here repeated. Of the land, etc., means "toward" or "against" the land. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the second strophe, Micah turns from the godless princes and judges to the prophets who lead the people astray, with whom he contrasts the true prophets and their ways. <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>. Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth, and preach peace; and whoever should put nothing into their mouths, against him they sanctify war. <a href="/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>. Therefore night to you because of the visions, and darkness to you because of the soothsaying! and the sun will set over the prophets, and the day blacken itself over them. <a href="/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>. And the seers will be ashamed, and the soothsayers blush, and all cover their beard, because (there is) no answer of God. <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>. But I, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of Jehovah, and with judgment and strength, to show to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin." As the first strophe attaches itself to <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>, so does the second to <a href="/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>, carrying out still further what is there affirmed concerning the false prophets. Micah describes them as people who predict peace and prosperity for a morsel of bread, and thereby lead the people astray, setting before them prosperity and salvation, instead of preaching repentance to them, by charging them with their sins. Thus they became accomplices of the wicked rulers, with whom they are therefore classed in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, together with the wicked priests. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, leading astray (cf. <a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>) my people, namely, by failing to charge them with their sins, and preach repentance, as the true prophets do, and predicting prosperity for bread and payment. The words, "who bite with their teeth," are to be connected closely with the next clause, "and they preach peace," in the sense of "who preach peace if they can bite with their teeth," i.e., if they receive something to bite (or eat). This explanation, which has already been expressed by the Chaldee, is necessarily required by the antithesis, "but whoever puts nothing into their mouth," i.e., gives them nothing to eat, notwithstanding the fact that in other passages na&#770;shakh only signifies to bite, in the sense of to wound, and is the word generally applied to the bite of a snake (<a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>, <a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8</a>). If, however, we understand the biting with the teeth as a figurative representation of the words of the prophets who always preach prosperity, and of the injury they do to the real welfare of the people (Ros., Casp., and others), the obvious antithesis of the two double clauses of <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a> is totally destroyed. The harsh expression, to "bite with the teeth," in the sense of "to eat," is perfectly in harmony with the harsh words of <a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a> and <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>. Qidde&#772;sh milcha&#770;ma&#770;h, to sanctify war, i.e., to preach a holy war (cf. <a href="/joel/3-9.htm">Joel 3:9</a>), or, in reality, to proclaim the vengeance of God. For this shall night and darkness burst upon them. Night and darkness denote primarily the calamity which would come upon the false prophets (unto you) in connection with the judgment (<a href="/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>). The sun which sets to them is the sun of salvation or prosperity (<a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>); and the day which becomes black over them is the day of judgment, which is darkness, and not light (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>). This calamity is heightened by the fact that they will then stand ashamed, because their own former prophecies are thereby proved to be lies, and fresh, true prophecies fail them, because God gives no answer. "Convicted by the result, they are thus utterly put to shame, because God does not help them out of their trouble by any word of revelation" (Hitzig). Bo&#772;sh, to be ashamed, when connected with cha&#770;phe&#772;r (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-26.htm">Psalm 35:26</a>., etc.), signifies to become pale with shame; cha&#770;phe&#772;r, to blush, with min causae, to denote the thing of which a man is ashamed. Qo&#772;sem&#305;&#772;m (diviners) alternates with cho&#772;z&#305;&#772;m (seers), because these false prophets had no visions of God, but only divinations out of their own hearts. &#8219;Ata&#770;h sa&#770;pha&#770;m: to cover the beard, i.e., to cover the face up to the nose, is a sign of mourning (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>), here of trouble and shame (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>), and is really equivalent to covering the head (<a href="/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a>; <a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>). Ma&#8219;a&#774;ne&#772;h, the construct state of the substantive, but in the sense of the participle; some codd. have indeed &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;. In <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a> Micah contrasts himself and his own doings with these false prophets, as being filled with power by the Spirit of Jehovah (i.e., through His assistance) and with judgment. Mishpa&#770;t, governed by &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;, is the divine justice which the prophet has to proclaim, and gebhu&#772;ra&#770;h strength, manliness, to hold up before the people their sins and the justice of God. In this divine strength he can and must declare their unrighteousness to all ranks of the people, and predict the punishment of God (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9-12</a>). </body></html>
