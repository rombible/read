No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves.

The words carry on the idea of “terrible and dreadful,” and describe the Chaldean’s manner of bearing himself among the nations, though it may be uncertain whether “his judgment” be that which regulates his own conduct or that which he imposes on the nations. The former sense is the more vigorous. The Chaldean’s own sense of himself corresponds to the dread he inspires. He is imperious and autocratic, allows no considerations from without to modify his action, his own haughty mind alone determines his procedure. Similarly his “dignity” or majesty is the supremacy and sovereignty which he assumes and exercises.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span>.

The prophet depicts this by saying that he will go about mourning as a prisoner, to set forth the misery that will come upon Judah (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>, <a href="/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>); and then, to confirm this, he announces to a series of cities the fate awaiting them, or rather awaiting the kingdom, by a continued play upon words founded upon their names (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10-15</a>); and finally he summons Zion to deep mourning (<a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>). <a href="/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>. "Therefore will I lament and howl, I will go spoiled and naked: I will keep lamentation like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches. <a href="/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>. For her stripes are malignant; for it comes to Judah, reaches to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem." &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; points back to what precedes, and is then explained in <a href="/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>. The prophet will lament over the destruction of Samaria, because the judgment which has befallen this city will come upon Judah also. Micah does not speak in his own name here as a patriot (Hitzig), but in the name of his nation, with which he identifies himself as being a member thereof. This is indisputably evident from the expression &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; &#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, which describes the costume of a prisoner, not that of a mourner. The form &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; with &#1497; appears to have been simply suggested by &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; is formed like &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9-10</a>, and other similar words (see Olshausen, Gramm. p. 342). The Masoretes have substituted &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-17.htm">Job 12:17</a>, but without the slightest reason. It does not mean "barefooted," &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx), for which there was already &#1497;&#1495;&#1507; in the language (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>), but plundered, spoiled. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, naked, i.e., without upper garment (see my comm. on <a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), not merely vestitu solido et decente privatus. Mourners do indeed go barefooted (ya&#770;che&#772;ph, see <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>), and in deep mourning in a hairy garment (saq, <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>, etc.), but not plundered and naked. The assertion, however, that a man was called &#768;a&#770;ro&#772;m when he had put on a mourning garment (saq, sackcloth) in the place of his upper garment, derives no support from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>, but rather a refutation. For there the prophet does not go about &#8219;a&#770;ro&#772;m veya&#770;che&#772;ph, i.e., in the dress of a prisoner, to symbolize the captivity of Egypt, till after he has loosened the hairy garment (saq) from his loins, i.e., taken it off. And here also the plundering of the prophet and his walking naked are to be understood in the same way. Micah's intention is not only to exhibit publicly his mourning fore the approaching calamity of Judah, but also to set forth in a symbolical form the fate that awaits the Judaeans. And he can only do this by including himself in the nation, and exhibiting the fate of the nation in his own person. Wailing like jackals and ostriches is a loud, strong, mournful cry, those animals being distinguished by a mournful wail; see the comm. on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>, which passage may possibly have floated before the prophet's mind. Thus shall Judah wail, because the stroke which falls upon Samaria is a malignant, i.e., incurable (the suffix attached to &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; refers to Sho&#772;mero&#772;n, Samaria, in <a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a> and <a href="/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>. For the singular of the predicate before a subject in the plural, see Ewald, 295, a, and 317, a). It reaches to Judah, yea, to Jerusalem. Jerusalem, as the capital, is called the "gate of my people," because in it par excellence the people went out and in. That &#1506;&#1491; is not exclusive here, but inclusive, embracing the terminus ad quem, is evident from the parallel "even to Judah;" for if it only reached to the border of Judah, it would not have been able to come to Jerusalem; and still more clearly so from the description in <a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>. The fact that Jerusalem is not mentioned till after Judah is to be interpreted rhetorically, and not geographically. Even the capital, where the temple of Jehovah stood, would not be spared. </body></html>
