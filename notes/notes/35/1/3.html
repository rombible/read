No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves.

God seemed to reverse what He had said by Balaam <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a>, "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, and hath not seen grievousness in Israel"; and in the Psalms Psa 10:14, "Thou hast seen, for thou (emphatic) beholdest grievousness and wrong, to put it in Thy hand," i. e., Thou layest it up in Thy hand, to cast it back on the head of the evildoer. Now He seemed to behold it and leave it unpunished, which yet Habakkuk says to God below, He could not do <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>; "Thou canst not look upon iniquity." What then did this mean? What was the solution?<p>All forms and shapes of sin are multiplied; oppressive "violence" , such as "covered the earth" before the flood, and brought it down; which Nineveh had to put away <a href="//biblehub.com/jonah/3-8.htm">Jonah 3:8</a>, and it was spared; "iniquity," i. e., what is unequal and contrary to truth, falsehood.<p>Grievance - literally, burdensome wearisome "toil"; "spoiling," or open robbery; "strife and contention," both through perversion of the law and, without it, through endless jarrings of man with man. Sin recoils on the sinner. So what he beholds is not "iniquity" only, but (in the same word) "vanity"; "grievance"; which is a burden both to him who suffers, and yet more to him who inflicts it. For nothing is so burdensome as sin, nothing so empty as wickedness. And while to him who suffers, the suffering is temporal, to him who inflicts it, it is eternal. And yet the prophet and whose prays against ungodliness, "must commiserate him who doth wrong yet more, since they hurt what is most precious, their own soul, and that eternally" . All then is full of evil. Wherever the prophet looks, some fresh violence is before him; it confronts him on every side; "strife hath arisen" , come up, exists where it was not before; "contention lifteth itself" on high, bowing down all beside. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. cause me to behold grievance&#8212;Maurer denies that the Hebrew verb is ever active; he translates, "(Wherefore) dost Thou behold (without doing aught to check) grievance?"

God by His interposition might have checked the iniquity; by His refraining the continuance of it is virtually due to Him. One thing pains the prophet—that he has to behold iniquity; and another perplexes him—that God, the Righteous One, brings him into such a trial, or leaves him in it. The Hebrew mind was the more profoundly agitated by the moral anomalies in the world, because it could not help ascribing them directly to God, Who was the immediate cause of all things. The feeling is often expressed in Job, e.g. <a href="/context/job/23-16.htm" title="For God makes my heart soft, and the Almighty troubles me:...">Job 23:16-17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The term “iniquity” is used both of physical evil, “affliction” (<a href="/jeremiah/4-14.htm" title="O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?">Jeremiah 4:14</a>; <a href="/job/5-6.htm" title="Although affliction comes not forth of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;">Job 5:6</a>), and moral evil, “wickedness”; here of the latter, as generally, e.g. in the common phrase “workers of iniquity.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">cause</span> me <span class="ital">to behold grievance</span>] <span class="bld">and dost look upon trouble</span>. The term grievance or trouble (<span class="ital"><a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm" title="You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity: why look you on them that deal treacherously, and hold your tongue when the wicked devours the man that is more righteous than he?">Habakkuk 1:13</a></span> R.V. <span class="ital">perverseness</span>), properly “labour,” toil, has also the double sense of misery, pain, sorrow, travail (<a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a>), or mischief, wrongdoing (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm" title="He made a pit, and dig it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.">Psalm 7:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/94-20.htm" title="Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you, which frames mischief by a law?">Psalm 94:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-4.htm" title="None calls for justice, nor any pleads for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.">Isaiah 59:4</a>). The latter half of the verse “spoiling and violence” is in favour of understanding all the terms not so much of evils suffered as of evils inflicted. The prophet is perplexed because God looks on unconcerned when men perpetrate wrong.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">spoiling and violence</span> are <span class="ital">before me</span>] The words again combined, <a href="/jeremiah/6-7.htm" title="As a fountain casts out her waters, so she casts out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.">Jeremiah 6:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm" title="For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.">Jeremiah 20:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/45-9.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, said the Lord GOD.">Ezekiel 45:9</a>; <a href="/amos/3-10.htm" title="For they know not to do right, said the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.">Amos 3:10</a>. The term “spoiling” means violent mishandling when used of a person, destruction or devastation when said of a thing. <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm" title="Howl you; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="/context/job/5-21.htm" title="You shall be hid from the whip of the tongue: neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes....">Job 5:21-22</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-13.htm" title="Woe to them! for they have fled from me: destruction to them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.">Hosea 7:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm" title="The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.">Psalm 12:6</a>.

This is the condition of things that has come about and prevails. The terms “strife” and “contention” certainly suggest animosities between members of the same community rather than injuries inflicted on a subject people by their conquerors. The conquerors of Israel did not mix among the inhabitants or interfere with individual persons, they merely demanded political subjection and tribute, and the latter they collected not from the people but from their rulers. Comp. the use of the two words in <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!

"For the apostasy of Jacob (is) all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. Who is Jacob's apostasy? is it not Samaria? And who Judah's high places? is it not Jerusalem? <a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>. Therefore I make Samaria into a stone-heap of the field, into plantations of vines; and I pour her stones into the valley, and I will lay bare her foundations. <a href="/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>. And all her stone images will be beaten to pieces, and all her lovers' gifts be burned with fire, and all her idols will I make into a waste: for she has gathered them of prostitute's hire, and to prostitute's hire shall they return." "All this" refers to the coming of Jehovah to judgment announced in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>, <a href="/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>. This takes place on account of the apostasy and the sins of Israel. &#1489; (for) used to denote reward or wages, as in <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a> compared with <a href="/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>. Jacob and Israel in <a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a> are synonymous, signifying the whole of the covenant nation, as we may see from the fact that in <a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a> Jacob and not Israel is the epithet applied to the ten tribes in distinction from Judah. &#1502;&#1497;, who? - referring to the author. The apostasy of Israel originates with Samaria; the worship on the high places with Jerusalem. The capitals of the two kingdoms are the authors of the apostasy, as the centres and sources of the corruption which has spread from them over the kingdoms. The allusion to the ba&#770;mo&#772;th of the illegal worship of the high places, which even the most godly kings were unable to abolish (see at <a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>), shows, moreover, that &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; denotes that religious apostasy from Jehovah which was formally sanctioned in the kingdom of the ten tribes by the introduction of the calf-worship. But because this apostasy commenced in the kingdom of the ten tribes, the punishment would fall upon this kingdom first, and Samaria would be utterly destroyed. Stone-heaps of the field and vineyard plantations harmonize badly, in Hitzig's view: he therefore proposes to alter the text. But there is no necessity for this. The point of comparison is simply that Samaria will be so destroyed, that not a single trace of a city will be left, and the site thereof will become like a ploughed field or plain. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; is added to &#1506;&#1497;, a heap of ruins or stones, to strengthen it. Samaria shall become like a heap, not of ruins of building stones, but of stones collected from the field. &#1500;&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; &#1499;&#1512;&#1501;, i.e., into arable land upon which you can plant vineyards. The figure answers to the situation of Samaria upon a hill in a very fruitful region, which was well adapted for planting vineyards (see at <a href="/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>). The situation of the city helps to explain the casting of its stones into the valley. Laying bare the foundations denotes destruction to the very foundation (cf. <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). On the destruction of the city all its idols will be annihilated. Pes&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, idols, as in <a href="/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>; not wooden idols, however, to which the expression yukkattu&#772;, smitten to pieces, would not apply, but stone idols, from pa&#770;sal (<a href="/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>). By the lovers' gifts ('ethna&#770;n, see at <a href="/hosea/9-1.htm">Hosea 9:1</a>) we are to understand, not "the riches of the city or their possessions, inasmuch as the idolaters regarded their wealth and prosperity as a reward from their gods, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>" (Rashi, Hitzig, and others), but the temple gifts, "gifts suspended in the temples and sacred places in honour of the gods" (Rosenmller), by which the temple worship with its apparatus were maintained; so that by 'ethna&#770;n we may understand the entire apparatus of religious worship. For the parallelism of the clauses requires that the word should be restricted to this. &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are also idolatrous images. "To make them into a waste," i.e., not only to divest them of their ornament, but so utterly to destroy them that the place where they once stood becomes waste. The next clause, containing the reason, must not be restricted to the &#8219;a&#774;tsabb&#305;&#772;m, as Hitzig supposes, but refers to the two clauses of the first hemistich, so that pes&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m and &#8219;a&#774;tsabb&#305;&#772;m are to be supplied as objects to qibba&#770;tsa&#770;h (she gathered), and to be regarded as the subject to ya&#770;shu&#772;bhu&#772; (shall return). Samaria gathered together the entire apparatus of her idolatrous worship from prostitute's gifts (the wages of prostitution), namely, through gifts presented by the idolaters. The acquisition of all this is described as the gain of prostitute's wages, according to the scriptural view that idolatry was spiritual whoredom. There is no ground for thinking of literal wages of prostitution, or money which flowed into the temples from the voluptuous worship of Aphrodite, because Micah had in his mind not literal (heathenish) idolatry, but simply the transformation of the Jehovah-worship into idolatry by the worship of Jehovah under the symbols of the golden calves. These things return back to the wagers of prostitution, i.e., they become this once more (cf. <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>) by being carried away by the enemies, who conquer the city and destroy it, and being applied to their idolatrous worship. On the capture of cities, the idols and temple treasures were carried away (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a>). </body></html>
