Thus Nebuchadnezzar set Jehoiakim as a tributary sovereign on the throne of Jerusalem and three years later deposed his son and successor Jehciaohin and made Zedekiah king.<p><span class= "bld">For they shall heap dust, and take it.</span>—This means that they shall besiege and carry all strongholds by means of the mounds of earth commonly used in sieges. These mounds were employed either to place the besieger on a level with the besieged, and so facilitate the operations of siege engines, or to form an inclined plane, up which the besieger might march his men, and so take the place by escalade. We find they were used by the Egyptians (<a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:">Ezekiel 17:17</a>) and the Assyrians (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.">2Kings 19:32</a>), as well as by the Babylonians (<a href="/jeremiah/6-6.htm" title="For thus has the LORD of hosts said, Hew you down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the middle of her.">Jeremiah 6:6</a>, and <span class= "ital">passim</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> They are mentioned as employed by the Spartan king Archidamus in the celebrated siege of Platæa in B.C. 429 (Thucydides, lib. 2).

By this and the next clause, <span class="ital">imputing this his power unto his god, </span>was foretold that the king of Babylon should be made arrogant by his victories, and should impute them to the power of the false gods he worshipped. This was remarkably true of Belshazzar, Nebuchadnezzar’s successor, who, with his thousand lords, when he was drinking wine in the golden and silver vessels taken out of God’s temple, and was thereby triumphing over Jehovah and his people, praised the gods of gold and silver, &c., as the authors of their successes and victories. It was also remarkably verified in Nebuchadnezzar himself, who, as we find from Daniel 3., cast three otherwise innocent persons, and faithful to him, into a furnace of fire, because they would not fall down before the idol which he had set up. But Grotius, and many others, interpret the latter part of the verse thus: <span class="ital">Saying this his strength is his god; </span>that is, imputing all his success to his own skill and prowess; a sense of the words which answers remarkably to the character of Nebuchadnezzar, as given in the book of Daniel: see chapter <a href="/daniel/3-17.htm" title="If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.">Daniel 3:17</a>, and <a href="/daniel/4-30.htm" title="The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?">Daniel 4:30</a>, and <a href="/daniel/5-20.htm" title="But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:">Daniel 5:20</a>. Probably the extraordinary insanity which befell Nebuchadnezzar, as the punishment of his pride and arrogance, might be also here intended in the first clause of this verse, which in the Hebrew is, <span class="ital">Then shall his spirit change and pass over, </span>&c. Here, then, is a remarkable proof of what the psalmist says, namely, that God <span class="ital">understandeth our thoughts afar off: </span>for here the alteration that should in after times be made in Nebuchadnezzar’s mind by his prosperity is expressly foretold, together with the punishment that should follow upon it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves.

See Daniel. Josephus attributes both the death and disgrace to Nebuchadnezzar: Ant. x. 6. 3), then Nebuchadnezzar took away Jehoiachin; then Zedekiah.

In the Assyrian monuments one often sees representations of these mounds, or of inclined planes constructed to facilitate the approach of the battering ram (see Bonomi, 'Nineveh and its Palaces,' pp. 181, 188, etc.; Layard, 'Nineveh,' etc., 2:369). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/micah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And the judgment will not even stop at Jerusalem, but will spread still further over the land. This spreading is depicted in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13-15</a> in the same manner as before. <a href="/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>. "Harness the horse to the chariot, O inhabitress of Lachish! It was the beginning of sin to the daughter Zion, that the iniquities of Israel were found in her. <a href="/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>. Therefore wilt thou give dismissal-presents to Moresheth-gath (i.e., the betrothed of Gath); the houses of Achzib (lying fountain) become a lying brook for Israel's kings. <a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. I will still bring thee the heir, O inhabitress of Mareshah (hereditary city); the nobility of Israel will come to Adullam. <a href="/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>. Make thyself bald, and shave thyself upon the sons of thy delights: spread out thy baldness like the eagle; for they have wandered away from thee." The inhabitants of Lachish, a fortified city in the Shephelah, to the west of Eleutheropolis, preserved in the ruins of Um Lakis (see at <a href="/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>), are to harness the horses to the chariot (rekhesh, a runner; see at <a href="/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a> : the word is used as ringing with la&#770;kh&#305;&#772;sh), namely, to flee as rapidly as possible before the advancing foe. &#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. "to bind ... the horse to the chariot," answering to the Latin currum jungere equis. Upon this city will the judgment fall with especial severity, because it has grievously sinned. It was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, i.e., to the population of Jerusalem; it was the first to grant admission to the iniquities of Israel, i.e., to the idolatry of the image-worship of the ten tribes (for &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, see <a href="/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a> and <a href="/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>), which penetrated even to the capital. Nothing more is known of this, as the historical books contain no account of it. For this reason, namely, because the sin of Israel found admission into Jerusalem, she (the daughter Zion) will be obliged to renounce Moresheth-gath. This is the thought of <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>, the drapery of which rests upon the resemblance in sound between Moresheth and me'ora&#770;sa&#770;h, the betrothed (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>). Shillu&#772;ch&#305;&#772;m, dismissal, denotes anything belonging to a man, which he dismisses or gives up for a time, or for ever. It is applied in <a href="/exodus/18-2.htm">Exodus 18:2</a> to the sending away of wife and children to the father-in-law for a time; and in <a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a> to a dowry, or the present which a father gives to his daughter when she is married and leaves his house. The meaning "divorce," i.e., se&#772;pher ker&#305;&#772;thuth (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Deuteronomy 24:3</a>), has been arbitrarily forced upon the word. The meaning is not to be determined from shille&#772;a&#774;ch in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a>, as Hitzig supposes, but from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>, where the same expression occurs, except that it is construed with &#1500;, which makes no material difference. For &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500; signifies to give to a person, either to lay upon him or to hand to him; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;, to give to him. The object given by Zion to Moresheth as a parting present is not mentioned, but it is really the city itself; for the meaning is simply this: Zion will be obliged to relinquish all further claim to Moresheth, to give it up to the enemy. Mo&#772;resheth is not an appellative, as the old translators suppose, but the proper name of Micah's home; and Gath is a more precise definition of its situation - "by Gath," viz., the well-known Philistian capital, analogous to Bethlehem-Judah in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7-9</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19-1.htm">Judges 19:1</a>, or Abel-maim (Abel by the water) in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>. According to Jerome (comm. in Mich. Prol.), Morasthi, qui usque hodie juxta Eleutheropolin, urbem Palaestinae, haud grandis est viculus (cf. Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 423). The context does not admit of our taking the word in an appellative sense, "possession of Gath," since the prophet does not mean to say that Judah will have to give up to the enemy a place belonging to Gath, but rather that it will have to give up the cities of its own possession. For, as Maurer correctly observes, "when the enemy is at the gate, men think of defending the kingdom, not of enlarging it." But if the addition of the term Gath is not merely intended to define the situation of Moresheth with greater minuteness, or to distinguish it from other places of the same name, and if the play upon words in Moresheth was intended to point to a closer relation to Gath, the thought expressed could only be, that the place situated in the neighbourhood of Gath had frequently been taken by the Philistines, or claimed as their property, and not that they were in actual possession of Gath at this time.<p>The play upon words in the second clause of the verse also points to the loss of places in Judaea: "the houses of Achzib will become Achzab to the kings of Israel." &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;, a lie, for &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;, is a stream which dries up in the hot season, and deceives the expectation of the traveller that he shall find water (<a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>; cf. <a href="/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>.). Achzib, a city in the plain of Judah, whose name has been preserved in the ruins of Kussabeh, to the south-west of Beit-Jibrin (see at <a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>). The houses of Achzib are mentioned, because they are, properly speaking, to be compared to the contents of the river's bed, whereas the ground on which they stood, with the wall that surrounded them, answered to the river's bed itself (Hitzig), so that the words do not denote the loss or destruction of the houses so much as the loss of the city itself. The "kings of Israel" are not the kings of Samaria and Judah, for Achzib belonged to the kingdom of Judah alone, but the kings of Judah who followed one another (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>); so that the plural is to be understood as relating to the monarchy of Israel (Judah). Mareshah will also pass into other hands. This is affirmed in the words, "I will bring the heir to thee again" (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497; for &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, as in <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>). The first heir of Mareshah was the Israelites, who received the city, which had been previously occupied by the Canaanites, for their possession on the conquest of the land. The second heir will be the enemy, into whose possession the land is now to pass. Mareshah, also in the lowland of Judah, has been preserved, so far as the name is concerned, in the ruins of Marash (see at <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>, and Tobler, Dritte Wanderung, pp. 129, 142-3). To the north of this was Adullam (see at <a href="/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), which has not yet been discovered, but which Tobler (p. 151) erroneously seeks for in Be&#770;t Du&#770;la. Micah mentions it simply on account of the cave there (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>), as a place of refuge, to which the great and glorious of Israel would flee ("the glory of Israel," as in <a href="/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>). The description is rounded off in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, by returning to the thought that Zion would mourn deeply over the carrying away of the people, with which it had first set out in <a href="/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>. In &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; Zion is addressed as the mother of the people. &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;, to shave smooth, and &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1494;, to cut off the hair, are synonyms, which are here combined to strengthen the meaning. The children of thy delights, in whom thou hast thy pleasure, are the members of the nation. Shaving the head bald, or shaving a bald place, was a sing of mourning, which had been handed down as a traditional custom in Israel, in spite of the prohibition in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a> (see at <a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). The bald place is to be made to spread out like that of a nesher, i.e., not the true eagle, but the vulture, which was also commonly classed in the eagle family, - either the bearded vulture, vultur barbatus (see Oedmann, Verm. Samml. i. p. 54ff.), or more probably the carrion vulture, vultur percnopterus L., common in Egypt, and also in Palestine, which has the front part of the head completely bald, and only a few hairs at the back of the head, so that a bald place may very well be attributed to it (see Hasselquist, Reise, p. 286ff.). The words cannot possibly be understood as referring to the yearly moulting of the eagle itself.<p>If we inquire still further as to the fulfilment of the prophecy concerning Judah (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8-16</a>), it cannot be referred, or speaking more correctly, it must not be restricted, to the Assyrian invasion, as Theod., Cyril, Marck, and others suppose. For the carrying away of Judah, which is hinted at in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a>, and clearly expressed in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, was not effected by the Assyrians, but by the Chaldeans; and that Micah himself did not expect this judgment from the Assyrians, but from Babel, is perfectly obvious from <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>, where he mentions Babel as the place to which Judah was to be carried into exile. At the same time, we must not exclude the Assyrian oppression altogether; for Sennacherib had not only already conquered the greater part of Judah, and penetrated to the very gates of Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-14</a>, <a href="/2_kings/18-19.htm">2 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1-38:22</a>), but would have destroyed the kingdom of Judah, as his predecessor Shalmaneser had destroyed the kingdom of Israel, if the Lord had not heard the prayer of His servant Hezekiah, and miraculously destroyed Sennacherib's army before the walls of Jerusalem. Micah prophesies throughout this chapter, not of certain distinct judgment, but of judgment in general, without any special allusions to the way in which it would be realized; so that the proclamation embraces all the judgments that have fallen upon Judah from the Assyrian invasion down to the Roman catastrophe. </body></html>
