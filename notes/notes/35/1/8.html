No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves.

Creatures remarkable for their swiftness: these are creatures born of the mating of a he panther and a lioness, and not of a lion and a she panther, as some have affirmed; and which adultery is highly resented by the lion; nor will he suffer it to go unrevenged, as Pliny (u) and Philostratus (w) observe: those thus begotten differ from common lions in this, that they have no manes: the panthers are the creatures here meant, which are very swift, as Bochart (x) from various authors has observed. Lucan (y) calls this creature "celerem pardum", t"he swift panther"; and Jerom says (z) nothing is swifter than the panther; and Aelianus (a) observes that the panther, by the swiftness of its running, will overtake most creatures, and particularly apes; and Eustathius (b) confirms the same, saying that it exceeds other creatures in swiftness, and as it were flies before the eyes of hunters; and Osorius (c) relates, that the king of Portugal once sent to the pope of Rome a panther tamed, which being had into the woods a hunting by a Persian hunter, with wonderful swiftness leaped upon the boars and deer, and killed them at once; and the Septuagint version here is, "their horses will leap above the panthers": or exceed them in leaping, for which these panthers are very famous too: an Arabic writer (d), whom Bochart mentions, says it will leap above forty cubits at a leap. Pliny (e) reports, that the panthers in Africa will get up into thick trees, and hide themselves in the branches, and leap from thence on those that pass by; and because of the swiftness of this creature, with other qualities of it, the third beast or Grecian monarchy, especially in its first head Alexander the great, is represented by it, <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a> he making such a swift and rapid progress in his conquests; and yet the Chaldean horses would exceed them in swiftness, and be very speedy in their march into the land of Judea; and therefore it was in vain for the Jews to please themselves with the thoughts that these people were a great way off, and so they secure from them, when they could and would be upon them presently, ere they were aware: <p>and are more fierce than ravening wolves; which creatures are naturally fierce, and especially when they are hungry, and particularly at evening; when, having had no food all the day, their appetites are very keen, and they go in quest of their prey; and, when they meet with it, fall upon it with greater eagerness and fierceness. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, than the wolves of Arabia; that there are wolves very frequent in Arabia, is observed by Diodorus Siculus (f), and Strabo (g); but that these are remarkable for their fierceness does not appear; rather those in colder climates are more fierce; so Pliny (h) says, they are little and sluggish in Africa and Egypt, but rough and fierce in cold climates. It is, in the original text, "more sharp" (i); which some interpret of the sharpness of their sight. Aelianus says (k), it is a most quick and sharp sighted creature; and can see in the night season, even though the moon shines not: the reason of which Pliny (l) gives is, because the eyes of wolves are shining, and dart light; hence Aelianus (m) observes, that that time of the night in which the wolf only by nature enjoys the light is called wolf light; and that Homer (n) calls a night which has some glimmering of light, or a sort of twilight, such as the wolves can see themselves walk by, , which is that light that precedes the rising sun; and he also observes that the wolf is sacred to the sun, and to Apollo, which are the same; and there was an image of one at Delphos; and so Macrobias (o) says, that the inhabitants of Lycopolis, a city of Thebais in Egypt, alike worship Apollo and a wolf, and in both the sun, because this animal takes and consumes all things like the sun; and, because perceiving much by the quick sight of its eyes, overcomes the darkness of the night; and observes, that some think they have their name from light, though they would have it be from the morning light; because those creatures especially observe that time for seizing on cattle, after a nights hunger, when before day light they are turned out of the stables into pasture; but it is for the most part at evening, and in the night, that wolves prowl about for their prey (p); and from whence they have the name of evening wolves, to which the Chaldean horses are here compared: and yet there seems to be an antipathy between these, if what some naturalists (q) say is true; as that if a horse by chance treads in the footsteps of a wolf, a numbness will immediately seize it, yea, even its belly will burst; (This sounds like a fable. Ed.) and that, if the hip bone of a wolf is thrown under horses drawing a chariot full speed, and they tread upon it, they will stop and stand stone still, immovable: whether respect is here had to the quick sight or sharp hunger of these creatures is not easy to say; though rather, since the comparison of them is with horses, it seems to respect the fierceness of them, for which the war horse is famous, <a href="/job/39-24.htm">Job 39:24</a> and may be better understood of the sharpness of the appetite of evening wolves, when hunger bitten: <p>and their horsemen shall spread themselves; or be multiplied, as the Targum; they shall be many, and spread themselves all over the country, so that there will be no escaping; all will fall into their hands: <p>and their horsemen shall come from far; as Chaldea was reckoned from Judea, and especially in comparison of neighbouring nations, who used to be troublesome, as Moab, Edom, &amp;c. see <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>, <p>they shall flee as the eagle that hasteth to eat; those horsemen shall be so speedy in their march, that they shall seem rather to fly than ride, and even to fly as swift as the eagle, the swiftest of birds, and which itself flies swiftest when hungry, and in sight of its prey; and the rather this bird is mentioned, because used by many nations, as the Persians, and others, for a military sign (r). <p>(u) Nat.

There is also a play upon words in &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;. The sentence belongs to what precedes, and supplies the fuller definition, that they are not to proclaim the calamity in Gath with weeping, i.e., not to weep over it there.<p>(Note: On the ground of the Septuagint rendering, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x395;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bc; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, most of the modern expositors follow Reland (Palaest. ill. p. 534ff.) in the opinion that &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493; is the name of a city, a contraction of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;, "and weep not at Acco." There is no force in the objection brought against this by Caspari (Mich. p. 110), namely, that in that case the inhabitants of both kingdoms must have stood out before the prophet's mind in hemistich a, which, though not rendered actually impossible by <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>, and the expression &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>, is hardly reconcilable with the fact that from <a href="/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a> onwards Judah only stands out before his mind, and that in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8-10</a> the distress of his people, in the stricter sense (i.e., of Judah), is obviously the pre-eminent object of his mourning. For Acco would not be taken into consideration as a city of the kingdom of Israel, but as a city inhabited by heathen, since, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>, the Canaanites were not driven out of Acco, and it cannot be shown from any passage of the Old Testament that this city ever came into the actual possession of the Israelites. It is evidently a more important objection to the supposed contraction, that not a single analogous case can be pointed out. The forms &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492; for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1506;&#1492; (<a href="/amos/8-8.htm">Amos 8:8</a>) and &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; (<a href="/joshua/19-3.htm">Joshua 19:3</a> and <a href="/joshua/15-29.htm">Joshua 15:29</a>) are of a different kind; and the blending of the preposition &#1489; with the noun &#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;, by dropping the &#1506;, so as to form one word, is altogether unparalleled. The Septuagint translation furnishes no sufficient authority for such an assumption. All that we can infer from the fact that Eusebius has adopted the reading &#x395;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc; in his Onom. (ed. Lars. p. 188), observing at the same time that this name occurs in Micah, whilst Aq. and Symm. have &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834; (in fletu) instead, is that these Greek fathers regarded the &#x395;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc; of the lxx as the name of a place; but this does not in the smallest degree prove the correctness of the lxx rendering. Nor does the position of &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493; before &#1488;&#1500; furnish any tenable ground for maintaining that this word cannot be the inf. abs. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, but must contain the name of a place. The assertion of Hitzig, that "if the word were regarded as an inf. abs., neither the inf. itself nor &#1488;&#1500; for &#1500;&#1488; would be admissible in a negative sentence (<a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>)," has no grammatical foundation. It is by no means a necessary consequence, that because &#1488;&#1500; cannot be connected with the inf. abs. (Ewald, 350, a), therefore the inf. abs. could not be written before a finite verb with &#1488;&#1500; for the sake of emphasis.)<p>After this reminiscence of the mourning of David for Saul, which expresses the greatness of the grief, and is all the more significant, because in the approaching catastrophe Judah is also to lose its king (cf. <a href="/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>), so that David is to experience the fate of Saul (Hengstenberg), Micah mentions places in which Judah will mourn, or, at any rate, experience something very painful. From <a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a> to <a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a> he mentions ten places, whose names, with a very slight alteration, were adapted for jeux de mots, with which to depict what would happen to them or take place within them. The number ten (the stamp of completeness, pointing to the fact that the judgment would be a complete one, spreading over the whole kingdom) is divided into twice five by the statement, which is repeated in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>, that the calamity would come to the fate of Jerusalem; five places being mentioned before Jerusalem (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10-12</a>), and five after (<a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13-15</a>). This division makes Hengstenberg's conjecture a very natural one, viz., that the five places mentioned before Jerusalem are to be sought for to the north of Jerusalem, and the others to the south or south-west, and that in this way Micah indicates that the judgment will proceed from the north to the south. On the other hand, Caspari's opinion, that the prophet simply enumerates certain places in the neighbourhood of Moresheth, his own home, rests upon no firm foundation.<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492; is probably the Ophrah of Benjamin (&#1506;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>), which was situated, according to Eusebius, not far from Bethel (see comm. on Josh. l.c.). It is pointed with pathach here for the sake of the paronomasia with &#1506;&#1508;&#1512;. The chethib &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the correct reading, the keri &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; being merely an emendation springing out of a misunderstanding of the true meaning. &#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean to revolve, but to bestrew one's self. Bestrewing with dust or ashes was a sign of deep mourning (<a href="/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>). The prophet speaks in the name of the people of what the people will do. The inhabitants of Shafir are to go stripped into captivity. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;, to pass by, here in the sense of moving forwards. The plural &#1500;&#1499;&#1501; is to be accounted for from the fact that yo&#772;shebheth is the population. Sha&#770;ph&#305;&#772;r, i.e., beautiful city, is not the same as the Sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>, for this was situated in the south-west of the mountains of Judah; nor the same as the Sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r in the mountains of Ephraim (<a href="/judges/10-1.htm">Judges 10:1</a>), which did not belong to the kingdom of Judah; but is a place to the north of Jerusalem, of which nothing further is known. The statement in the Onomast. s.v. &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834; between Eleutheropolis and Askalon - is probably intended to apply to the Sha&#770;m&#305;&#772;r of Joshua; but this is evidently erroneous, as the country between Eleutheropolis and Askalon did not belong to the mountains of Judah, but to the Shephelah. &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1470;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, a combination like &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511; in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>, equivalent to stripping which is shame, shame-nakedness  equals  ignominious stripping. &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; is an accusative defining the manner in which they would go out. The next two clauses are difficult to explain. &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1503;, a play upon words with &#1497;&#1510;&#1488;&#1492;, is traceable to this verb, so far as its meaning is concerned. The primary meaning of the name is uncertain; the more modern commentators combine it with &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;, in the sense of rich in flocks. The situation of Zaanan is quite unknown. The supposed identity with Zena&#770;n see at <a href="/joshua/15-37.htm">Joshua 15:37</a>) must be given up, as Zena&#770;n was in the plain, and Zaanan was most probably to the north of Jerusalem. The meaning of the clause can hardly be any other than this, that the population of Zaanan had not gone out of their city to this war from fear of the enemy, but, on the contrary, had fallen back behind their walls (Ros., Casp., Hitzig). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1510;&#1500; is most likely the same as &#1488;&#1510;&#1500; in <a href="//biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>, a place in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, to the east of the Mount of Olives, as Beth is frequently omitted in the names of places (see Ges. Thes. p. 193). Etsel signifies side, and as an adverb or preposition, "by the side of." This meaning comes into consideration there. The thought of the words mispad be&#772;th, etc., might be: "The lamentation of Beth-Haezel will take away its standing (the standing by the side of it, 'etslo&#772;) from you (Judaeans), i.e., will not allow you to tarry there as fugitives (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>). The distress into which the enemy staying there has plunged Beth-Haezel, will make it impossible for you to stop there" (Hitzig, Caspari). But the next clause, which is connected by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, does not suit this explanation (<a href="/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>). The only way in which this clause can be made to follow suitably as an explanation is by taking the words thus: "The lamentation of Beth-Haezel will take its standing (the stopping of the calamity or judgment) from you, i.e., stop near it, as we should expect from its name; for (<a href="/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>) Maroth, which stands further off, will feel pain," etc. With this view, which Caspari also suggests, Hengstenberg (on <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>) agrees in the main, except that he refers the suffix in &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; to &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491;, and renders the words thus: "The lamentation of Beth-Haezel will take its stopping away from you, i.e., the calamity will not stop at Beth-Haezel (at the near house), i.e., stop near it, as we should expect from its name; for (<a href="/micah/1-12.htm">Micah 1:12</a>) Maroth, which stands further off, will feel pain," etc. With this view, which Caspari also suggests, Hengstenberg (on <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>) agrees in the main, except that he refers the suffix in &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1493; to &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1491;, and renders the words thus: "The lamentation of Beth-Haezel will take its stopping away from you, i.e., will not allow you the stopping of the lamentation." Grammatically considered, this connection is the more natural one; but there is this objection, that it cannot be shown that &#1506;&#1502;&#1491; is used in the sense of the stopping or ceasing of a lamentation, whereas the supposition that the suffix refers to the calamity simply by constructio ad sensum has all the less difficulty, inasmuch as the calamity has already been hinted at in the verb &#1504;&#1490;&#1506; in <a href="//biblehub.com/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>, and in <a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a> also it forms the object to be supplied in thought. Maroth (lit., something bitter, bitternesses) is quite unknown; it is simply evident, from the explanatory clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, that it was situated in the immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem. The inhabitants of Maroth writhe (cha&#770;la&#770;h, from chu&#772;l, to writhe with pain, like a woman in child-birth), because they are also smitten with the calamity, when it comes down to the gate of Jerusalem. &#1500;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, "on account of the good," which they have lost, or are about to lose. </body></html>
