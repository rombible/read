The phrase implies that the Chaldæans were not yet in Judæa, but there is no occasion to find an allusion to the recent rise of the Chaldæan nation. We notice this point because an ethnological theory (now generally abandoned) has regarded the Chaldæans of the prophetic period as raised to national existence only a little time before the date of Habakkuk. It was supposed that they were a race distinct from the Chaldæans of earlier Scripture; being, in fact, an association of northern hordes who had but recently penetrated the lower Mesopotamian valley. <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6</a> and <a href="/isaiah/23-13.htm" title="Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.">Isaiah 23:13</a> were therefore interpreted as illustrating the fact that these new nationalities “were on a sudden ‘raised up,’ elevated from their low estate of Assyrian colonists, to be the conquering people which they became under Nebuchadnezzar.” The confutation of this theory may be found in Rawlinson’s <span class= "ital">Ancient Monarchies,</span> i. 57, 59. It appears that Babylon was peopled at this time, not, as was formerly supposed, with hordes of Armenians, Arabs, Kurds, and Sclaves, but with a mixed population, in which the old Chaldæan and Assyrian elements preponderated. The Chaldæans of the seventh century B.C. were, in fact, as legitimate descendants of the people of Nimrod’s empire as we are of the Saxons. Certainly, the rapidity with which Babylon rose from the position of an Assyrian colony to that of ruler of Asia was marvellous. But the work which is to make the Jews wonder is not God’s choice of an agent, but that agent’s proceeding; not the elevation of one Gentile power in the place of another, but the attack which that new power is to make upon the sacred city.<p><span class= "bld">Bitter and hasty</span>.—Better, <span class= "ital">fierce and impetuous.</span> The association of these two epithets, <span class= "ital">mar</span> and <span class= "ital">nimhâr,</span> is the more forcible, because of their similarity in sound.

Therefore the coming of the Chaldeans into the country is spoken of here as a thing entirely new, and as if that people had been called into existence for the very purpose of punishing the Jewish nation. There is a prophecy similar to this in Isaiah, with regard to the Assyrians, in whom the Jewish nation then placed their chief confidence, and thought of nothing less than of the evils which Isaiah threatened should be brought upon them by that nation: so weak and short-sighted often is human policy! see Isaiah 7. <span class="ital">That bitter and hasty nation — </span>That people cruel, in their disposition, quick in executing their purposes, and hasty in their marches, <a href="/context/isaiah/5-26.htm" title="And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:...">Isaiah 5:26-27</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/5-16.htm" title="Their quiver is as an open sepulcher, they are all mighty men....">Jeremiah 5:16-17</a>. <span class="ital">Which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess,</span> &c. — This is spoken of the Chaldeans extending their conquests to a vast distance from the original seat of their empire.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 The servants of the Lord are deeply afflicted by seeing ungodliness and violence prevail; especially among those who profess the truth. No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves.

"Therefore will I lament and howl, I will go spoiled and naked: I will keep lamentation like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches. <a href="/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>.

The prophet will lament over the destruction of Samaria, because the judgment which has befallen this city will come upon Judah also. Micah does not speak in his own name here as a patriot (Hitzig), but in the name of his nation, with which he identifies himself as being a member thereof. This is indisputably evident from the expression &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; &#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, which describes the costume of a prisoner, not that of a mourner. The form &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; with &#1497; appears to have been simply suggested by &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1500; is formed like &#1492;&#1497;&#1491;&#1491; in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9-10</a>, and other similar words (see Olshausen, Gramm. p. 342). The Masoretes have substituted &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;, after <a href="//biblehub.com/job/12-17.htm">Job 12:17</a>, but without the slightest reason. It does not mean "barefooted," &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx), for which there was already &#1497;&#1495;&#1507; in the language (<a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a>), but plundered, spoiled. &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1501;, naked, i.e., without upper garment (see my comm. on <a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), not merely vestitu solido et decente privatus. Mourners do indeed go barefooted (ya&#770;che&#772;ph, see <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>), and in deep mourning in a hairy garment (saq, <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>, etc.), but not plundered and naked. The assertion, however, that a man was called &#768;a&#770;ro&#772;m when he had put on a mourning garment (saq, sackcloth) in the place of his upper garment, derives no support from <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>, but rather a refutation. For there the prophet does not go about &#8219;a&#770;ro&#772;m veya&#770;che&#772;ph, i.e., in the dress of a prisoner, to symbolize the captivity of Egypt, till after he has loosened the hairy garment (saq) from his loins, i.e., taken it off. And here also the plundering of the prophet and his walking naked are to be understood in the same way. Micah's intention is not only to exhibit publicly his mourning fore the approaching calamity of Judah, but also to set forth in a symbolical form the fate that awaits the Judaeans. And he can only do this by including himself in the nation, and exhibiting the fate of the nation in his own person. Wailing like jackals and ostriches is a loud, strong, mournful cry, those animals being distinguished by a mournful wail; see the comm. on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>, which passage may possibly have floated before the prophet's mind. Thus shall Judah wail, because the stroke which falls upon Samaria is a malignant, i.e., incurable (the suffix attached to &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; refers to Sho&#772;mero&#772;n, Samaria, in <a href="/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a> and <a href="/micah/1-7.htm">Micah 1:7</a>. For the singular of the predicate before a subject in the plural, see Ewald, 295, a, and 317, a). It reaches to Judah, yea, to Jerusalem. Jerusalem, as the capital, is called the "gate of my people," because in it par excellence the people went out and in. That &#1506;&#1491; is not exclusive here, but inclusive, embracing the terminus ad quem, is evident from the parallel "even to Judah;" for if it only reached to the border of Judah, it would not have been able to come to Jerusalem; and still more clearly so from the description in <a href="/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>. The fact that Jerusalem is not mentioned till after Judah is to be interpreted rhetorically, and not geographically. Even the capital, where the temple of Jehovah stood, would not be spared. </body></html>
