The word we have translated “advance” or “progress” reminds Christian ministers and teachers of St. Paul’s grave words to Timothy—and, through Timothy, to all occupying any position of authority in the congregations—that there must be no standing still, no resting content with knowledge already acquired, no being satisfied with the present spiritual life; there must be a restless striving after the acquirement of new stores of knowledge, ever deeper and more accurate; there must be a ceaseless endeavour to attain to a higher eminence in the spiritual life; and, if the minister or teacher would be successful, the <span class= "ital">result</span> of these efforts must be manifest to the brethren with whom his lot was cast.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/4-15.htm" title="Meditate on these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all....">1 Timothy 4:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Meditate on these things </span>— On the instructions I have given thee, or the things mentioned <a href="/1_timothy/4-13.htm" title="Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.">1 Timothy 4:13</a>.

By thus faithfully discharging their duty, they will give satisfactory proof of the reality of their faith and love, and the sincerity of their obedience, and, persevering in this way, will save themselves eternally. In the mean time by their sound doctrine, and, edifying example, they will impress their hearers with such a just sense of the truth and excellence of Christianity, as to induce them also to believe and obey the gospel, so that they likewise will be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities and follies. Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Meditate upon these things - Upon the train of events by which you have been led into the ministry, and upon the responsibilites and duties of the office. Let your mind be deeply impressed with these things; make them the subject of profound and serious thought.<p>Give thyself wholly to them - Greek "Be in them" - a phrase similar to that of Horace - "totus in illis." The meaning is plain. He was to devote his life wholly to this work. He was to have no other grand aim of living. His time, attention, talents, were to be absorbed in the proper duties of the work. He was not to make that subordinate and tributary to any other purpose, nor was he to allow any other object to interfere with the appropriate duties of that office. He was not to live for money, fame, or pleasure; not to devote his time to the pursuits of literature or science for their own sakes; not to seek the reputation of an elegant or profound scholar; not to aim to be distinguished merely as an accomplished gentleman, or as a skillful farmer, teacher, or author. Whatever was done in any of these departments, was to be wholly consistent with the direction, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;  en toutois isthi - "be in these things" - be absorbed in the appropriate duties of the ministerial office. It may be remarked here that no man will ever make much of himself, or accomplish much in any profession, who does not make this the rule of his life. He who has one great purpose of life to which he patiently and steadily devotes himself, and to which he makes everything else bend, will uniformly rise to high respectability, if not to eminence.

A minister of the gospel ought to make steady improvement in all that pertains to his office. No man ought to be satisfied with present attainments.<p>To all - Margin, "in all things." The margin is the more correct rendering, but either of them makes good sense. It should be apparent to all persons who attend on the stated preaching of a minister of the gospel, that he is making steady advances in knowledge, wisdom, and piety, and in all things that pertain to the proper performance of the duties of his office. If a man really makes progress, it will be seen and appreciated by others; if he does not, that will be as well understood by his hearers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Not only on those instructions, advices, and exhortations, which the apostle had given him, throughout this chapter, which might be very useful to him, often to think of, and revolve in his mind, and seriously consider and reflect upon; but upon the Scriptures, the reading of which he had recommended to him, and the doctrines contained therein; it becomes every man not only to read, but meditate on the word of God, and much more ministers of the Gospel. The Scriptures should be read with care, and be industriously and laboriously searched into, as men dig in mines for silver or golden ore; and passages in it should be carefully compared together, the more obscure with those that are more plain and easy; and the whole is to be studied with great attention and application: <p>give thyself wholly to them: to the reading of the Scriptures, meditation upon them, and preaching the doctrines contained in them, clear of all secular affairs, or worldly business and employment. The apostles threw off the branch of deaconship, or ministering to the poor, that they might give themselves up wholly to the ministry of the word, and prayer; and much more should worldly business be cast off, where the circumstances of ministers and churches will admit of it; a Christian soldier, or minister of the Gospel, ought not, if possible, to be entangled with the affairs of this life; he finds enough to do without, in the discharge of his ministerial function; and though the apostles sometimes wrought with their own hands, yet it was not because they had so much leisure from the ministry, or time on their hands, or because they had not a power of forbearing working, but out of necessity, see <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>, or these words may be rendered, <p>be thou in these things; let thine heart be in them; for if a minister's heart is not in his work, if he does not take delight in it, it will be a slavery and drudgery to him; spend all the time and strength in them, give thyself continually to them, and be always diligent and laborious in them: <p>that thy profiting may appear to all; that it may be manifest to all that attend the ministry of the word that there is an increase in gifts, a growing in spiritual knowledge, an improvement of the talents bestowed: or that this profiting or increase might appear in all things; in every branch of the ministry, both in exhortation or consolation, and in doctrine; or that it might be manifest among all; that is, all that hear might receive some profit, might learn, and be comforted and edified; faith might be increased, and the joy of it be furthered; and all under the ministry visibly thrive and flourish. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/4-15.htm" title="Meditate on these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all.">1 Timothy 4:15</a>.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>, besides this passage, occurs in its classical sense of "premeditating" or "getting up a speech," in <a href="/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a> (where, however, the reading is doubtful), and again in <a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>, in the sense of "premeditating" certain actions. A kindred use in classical Greek is "to practice" or "exercise" an art, as rhetoric, dancing, shooting with a bow, and the like. It is very common in the LXX., in the sense of "meditating," practicing in the thoughts. <span class="cmt_word">Give thyself wholly to them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">be in these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be wholly and always occupied with them.

It is used twice in <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12, 25</a>. A good example of its use in classical Greek is that in Polyb., 3:4, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> for "to advance," "make progress," is still more common (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>; <a href="/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; Galatians L 14; <a href="/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-9.htm">2 Timothy 3:9, 14</a>).

Often in Class. and lxx. Most translators reject the A.V. meditate, and substitute be diligent in, or practice, or take care for. Meditate, however, is legitimate, although in Class. the word commonly appears in one of the other senses. The connection between the different meanings is apparent. Exercise or practice applied to the mind becomes thinking or meditation. In lxx it represents seven Hebrew equivalents, and signifies to meditate, talk of, murmur, delight one's self in, attend to. Often to meditate, <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>; Sir. 6:7. Meditation is a talking within the mind, and issues in speech; hence to speak, as <a href="/psalms/35-28.htm">Psalm 35:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-30.htm">Psalm 37:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/69-3.htm">Isaiah 69:3</a>. Similarly, &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; signifies both reason and discourse. In Lat. meditari, "to reflect," is also "to exercise in," "to practice," as Virgil, <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>. In the Vulg. meditabor is the translation of murmur or mourn in <a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>. The Hebrew &#1492;&#1464;&#1490;&#1464;&#1492;&#1469; means to murmur, whisper; hence the inner whispering of the heart; hence to think, meditate, consider, as <a href="/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>.<p>Give thyself wholly to them (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit. be in these things.

The opposite is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to cut into, throw obstacles in the way, and so hinder.
