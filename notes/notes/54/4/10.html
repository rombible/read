We know that the promise made will be fulfilled, because the God on whom—as on a sure foundation—our hopes rest, is a <span class= "ital">living</span> God. “Living,” in strong contrast to those dumb and lifeless idols shrined in the well-known Ephesian temples.<p><span class= "bld">Who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</span>—These words, like the assertion of <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1Timothy 2:4</a>, have been often pressed into the service of that school of kindly, but mistaken, interpreters, who ignore, or explain away, the plain doctrine of Holy Scripture which tells us there are those whose destruction from the presence of the Lord shall be everlasting, whose portion shall be the “second death” (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;">2Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>). These interpreters prefer to substitute in place of this terrible, but <span class= "ital">repeated</span> declaration, their own perilous theories of universalism. Here the gracious words seem to affix a seal to the statement immediately preceding, which speaks of “the hope in the living God” as the source of all the labour and brave patience of the Lord’s true servants. The <span class= "ital">living</span> God is also a <span class= "ital">loving</span> God, the Saviour of <span class= "ital">all, </span>if they would receive Him, and, undoubtedly, the Redeemer of those who accept His love and are faithful to His holy cause.<p>It must be borne in mind that there were many Hebrews still in every Christian congregation, many in every church, who still clung with passionate zeal to the old loved Hebrew thought, that Messiah’s work of salvation was limited to the chosen race. This and similar sayings were specially meant to set aside for ever these narrow and selfish conceptions of the Redeemer’s will; were intended to show these exclusive children of Israel that Christ’s work would stretch over a greater and a grander platform than ever Israel could fill; were designed to tell out to all the churches how indeed “it was a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel.” Still, with all these guarded considerations, which serve to warn us from entertaining any hopes of a universal redemption, such a saying as this seems to point to the blessed Atonement mystery as performing a work whose consequences reach far beyond the limits of human thought, or even of sober speculation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:6-10 Outward acts of self-denial profit little. What will it avail us to mortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mere outward things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much in the promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him. If Christ be thus the Saviour of all men, then much more will he be the Rewarder of those who seek and serve him; he will provide well for those whom he has made new creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach - In making this truth known, that all might be saved, or that salvation was offered to all. The "labor" was chiefly experienced in carrying this intelligence abroad among the Gentiles; the "reproach" arose chiefly from the Jews for doing it.<p>Because we trust in the living God - This does not mean, as our translation would seem to imply, that he labored and suffered "because" he confided in God, or that this was the "reason" of his sufferings, but rather that this trust in the living God was his "support" in these labors and trials. "We labor and suffer reproach, for we have hope in God. Through him we look for salvation. We believe that he has made this known to people, and believing this, we labor earnestly to make it known, even though it be attended with reproaches." The sentiment is, that the belief that God has revealed a plan of salvation for all people, and invites all people to be saved, will make his friends willing to "labor" to make this known, though it be attended with reproaches.<p>Who is the Saviour of all men - This must be understood as denoting that he is the Saviour of all people in some sense which differs from what is immediately affirmed - "especially of those that believe." There is something pertaining to "them" in regard to salvation which does not pertain to "all men." It cannot mean that he brings all people to heaven, "especially" those who believe - for this would be nonsense. And if he brings all people actually to heaven, how can it be "especially" true that he does this in regard to those who believe? Does it mean that he saves others "without" believing? But this would be contrary to the uniform doctrine of the Scriptures; see <a href="/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>. When, therefore, it is said that he "is the Saviour of 'all' people, 'especially' of those who believe," it must mean that there is a sense in which it is true that he may be called the Saviour of all people, while, at the same time, it is "actually" true that those only are saved who believe. This may be true in two respects:<p>(1) As he is the "Preserver" of people <a href="//biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>, for in this sense he may be said to "save" them from famine, and war, and peril - keeping them from day to day; compare <a href="/psalms/107-28.htm">Psalm 107:28</a>;<p>(2) as he has "provided" salvation for all people. He is thus their Saviour - and may be called the common Saviour of all; that is, he has confined the offer of salvation to no one class of people; he has not limited the atonement to one division of the human race; and he actually saves all who are willing to be saved by him.<p>(See supplementary note on <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>. This passage however is not regarded a proof text now on the extent of the atonement, as the fair rendering of &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;  so&#772;te&#772;r is "Preserver." Dr. Wardlaw has accordingly excluded it in his recent work.)<p>Specially of those that believe - This is evidently designed to limit the previous remark. If it had been left there, it might have been inferred that he would "actually save" all people. But the apostle held no such doctrine, and he here teaches that salvation is "actually" limited to those who believe. This is the speciality or the uniqueness in the salvation of those who actually reach heaven, that they are "believers;" see the notes on <a href="/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>. All people, therefore, do not enter heaven, unless all people have faith. But is this so? What evidence is there that the great mass of mankind die believing on the Son of God? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. therefore&#8212;Greek, "with a view to this." The reason why "we both ('both' is omitted in the oldest manuscripts) labor (endure hardship) and suffer reproach (some oldest manuscripts read 'strive') is because we have rested, and do rest our hope, on the living (and therefore, life-giving, 1Ti 4:8) God."<p>Saviour&#8212;even in this life (1Ti 4:8).<p>specially of those that believe&#8212;Their "labor and reproach" are not inconsistent with their having from the living God, their Saviour, even the present life (Mr 10:30, "a hundred fold now in this time &#8230; with persecutions"), much more the life to come. If God is in a sense "Saviour" of unbelievers (1Ti 2:4, that is, is willing to be so everlastingly, and is temporally here their Preserver and Benefactor), much more of believers. He is the Saviour of all men potentially (1Ti 1:15); of believers alone effectually.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If we did not believe this as <span class="ital">a faithful saying, </span> that <span class="ital">godliness is profitable for all things, </span> and <span class="ital">trust in God, </span> who liveth for ever, to see to the fulfilling of it, to what purpose should <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">we labour and suffer reproach</span> as we do; labouring in the work of God, suffering reproach in the cause of God, and for living godly lives, worshipping God according to his will, and denying ourselves in sensual satisfactions and sensible enjoyments, that we might fulfil the law of Christ? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Objection.</span> But, will some say: how then is godliness profitable for all things, how doth the faithfulness of the promises for this life annexed to godliness appear, if those that profess it must labour and suffer reproach? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Solution.</span> Labour for God is a reward to itself, our honour, not our burden, his service is perfect freedom: the promises of this life, annexed to godliness, are not promises of sensual rest and ease, but of inward peace, satisfaction, and support of other things, only with a reserve to the Divine wisdom and judgment, so far forth as our heavenly Father shall see it fit for his glory and our good; yet they are not vain, for God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">who is the Saviour, </span> that is, the Preserver, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">of all men, </span> the Preserver of man and beast, as the psalmist speaketh, is in a more especial manner the Saviour <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">of those that believe, <a href="/psalms/33-18.htm" title="Behold, the eye of the LORD is on them that fear him, on them that hope in his mercy;">Psalm 33:18</a>,19</span>. This seemeth rather to be the sense of the text, than to understand it of eternal salvation, for so God is not the actual Saviour of all; besides that the text seemeth to speak of a work proper to the Father, rather than to the Son. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For therefore we both labour,.... Not in the word and doctrine, though they did; nor in the exercise of internal godliness, though there is a work in faith, and a labour in love; nor with their own hands, at their trades and business, to support themselves, and others; but by enduring hardships and afflictions, as stripes, imprisonment, weariness, pain, watchings, fastings, hunger, thirst, cold, and nakedness; see <a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>. <p>And suffer reproach; with patience and cheerfulness. The Alexandrian copy, and another manuscript, read, "we strive"; or contend even to an agony, combating with sin, Satan, and the world, with profane men, and with false teachers; and to all this they were animated by the promises made to godliness; and therefore they showed it by their practices, or rather by their sufferings, that they believed it to be a true and faithful saying; and which is further conferred by what follows: <p>because we trust in the living God; for the accomplishment of the said promises, who has power, and therefore can, and is faithful, and therefore will, make good what he has promised; and since it is life he has promised, faith is the more encouraged to trust in him, since he is the living God, in opposition to, and distinction from, lifeless idols; he has life in himself, essentially, originally, and independently, and is the author and giver of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal, unto others. Wherefore there is good reason to trust in him for the fulfilling of the promises of the present and future life, made unto godliness. <p>Who is the Saviour of all men; in a providential way, giving them being and breath, upholding them in their beings, preserving their lives, and indulging them with the blessings and mercies of life; for that he is the Saviour of all men, with a spiritual and everlasting salvation, is not true in fact. <p>Specially of those that believe; whom though he saves with an eternal salvation; yet not of this, but of a temporal salvation, are the words to be understood: or as there is a general providence, which attends all mankind, there is a special one which relates to the elect of God; these are regarded in Providence, and are particularly saved and preserved before conversion, in order to be called; and after conversion, after they are brought to believe in Christ, they are preserved from many enemies, and are delivered out of many afflictions and temptations; and are the peculiar care and darlings of providence, being to God as the apple of his eye: and there is a great deal of reason to believe this, for if he is the Saviour of all men, then much more of them who are of more worth, value, and esteem with him, than all the world beside; and if they are saved by him with the greater salvation, then much more with the less; and if he the common Saviour of all men, and especially of saints, whom he saves both ways, then there is great reason to trust in him for the fulfilment of the promises of life, temporal and eternal, made to godliness, and godly persons. This epithet of God seems to be taken out of <a href="/psalms/17-7.htm">Psalm 17:7</a> where he is called , "the Saviour of them that trust", or believe. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, specially of those that believe.">1 Timothy 4:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ κοπιῶμεν καὶ ὀνειδιζόμεθα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] The particle <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> shows that this verse is to serve as a reason or confirmation of the preceding thought that godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of this and the future life. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς τοῦτο</span> is by expositors either referred directly to this thought (de Wette, van Oosterzee), or is joined with the <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> following (Wiesinger); in the latter case the <span class="greekheb">ἠλπίκαμεν</span> points only to the thought in <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm" title="For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. The former construction deserves the preference, not only because it is more natural to refer the <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> to the thought of <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm" title="For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.">1 Timothy 4:8</a> so purposely confirmed by <a href="/1_timothy/4-9.htm" title="This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.">1 Timothy 4:9</a>; and also because <span class="greekheb">εἰς τοῦτο</span> cannot be taken as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> (by which Theodoret paraphrases it), <span class="ital">id circo</span> (Beza). <span class="greekheb">Εἰς</span> always points to a goal (and not to the reason of something). <span class="greekheb">Ἠλπικέναι</span>, however, as an already existing condition, cannot be regarded as the goal to which the <span class="greekheb">κοπιᾶν</span> is directed; hence Luther’s translation: “to this end we labour also … that we … have hoped,” cannot be justified. The meaning therefore is: In regard to this, that godliness has promise, viz. in order that this promise may be fulfilled in us, we labour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> <span class="greekheb">καὶ κοπιῶμεν καὶ ὀνειδιζόμεθα</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is either equivalent to “both … and,” or the first <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is equivalent to “yea also,” and the second <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is simply “and.” In the former case the two ideas <span class="greekheb">κοπιᾶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδίζεσθαι</span> are more widely separated; in the latter, they are more closely connected. The second view seems to be more natural. There is very weighty authority for the reading: <span class="greekheb">κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα</span>, which also gives a thoroughly appropriate meaning; but still the <span class="ital">Rec.</span>, for which, too, almost all expositors (de Wette, Wiesinger, Reiche, van Oosterzee, Hofmann, and others) have decided, might be preferred. The change of <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδιζόμεθα</span> into <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνιζόμεθα</span> may be easily explained from the following facts, that in <a href="/colossians/1-29.htm" title=" Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.">Colossians 1:29</a> <span class="greekheb">κοπιᾶν</span> is joined with <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνίζεσθαι</span>, that <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδίζειν</span> does not occur elsewhere in Paul (except at <a href="/romans/15-3.htm" title="For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.">Romans 15:3</a> in an O. T. quotation), that the passive <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδιζόμεθα</span> does not seem suitable, whereas <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνιζόμεθα</span> agrees well with the figure in <a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm" title="For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. On the other hand, the change of <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνιζόμεθα</span> into <span class="greekheb">ὀνειδιζόμεθα</span> is scarcely explicable. The plural <span class="greekheb">κοπιῶμεν</span> is not to be limited to the apostle, or to him and Timothy; it expresses the general Christian consciousness. The verb, often joined with another verb which has in it the idea of active exertion (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-28.htm" title="Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.">Ephesians 4:28</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-29.htm" title=" Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.">Colossians 1:29</a>), does not denote simple labour, but labour with trouble and suffering: “to toil and moil” (Heydenreich); <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὀνειδιζόμεθα</span> again points to the reproach which the Christian bears from the world. <span class="greekheb">Ὀνειδιζόμεθα</span> is a “concise expression for we endure to be slandered” (Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἠλπίκαμεν ἐπὶ Θεῷ ζῶντι</span>] If <span class="greekheb">εἰς τοῦτο</span> refers to what precedes, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is equivalent to “because;” the meaning in that case is: in regard to the promise given to <span class="greekheb">εὐσέβεια</span>, we take trouble and reproach upon ourselves, because we have set our hope on the living God, and are certain, therefore, that that promise does not remain unfulfilled. <span class="greekheb">Ὅτι</span> refers to both the preceding verbs, and does not merely stand “in close connection with the latter,” as van Oosterzee without reason thinks. The perfect <span class="greekheb">ἠλπίκαμεν</span> as here: <a href="/1_corinthians/15-19.htm" title="If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.">1 Corinthians 15:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;">2 Corinthians 1:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God is here called the <span class="ital">living</span> God, inasmuch as He fulfils what He has promised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἐλπίζειν</span> is construed with <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> and the dative, because the living God is regarded as the ground on which the hope rests. The construction is only found here at <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, and at <a href="/romans/15-12.htm" title="And again, Esaias said, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.">Romans 15:12</a> in an O.

We may render the whole ‘faithful saying’ thus:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Right well for such a wage and prize<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We toil, we wrestle on<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Till hope’s far goal be won,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Love’s full salvation, Life that lies<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In God the Living One<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For each created son—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Full Life, where Faith to Love replies.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we both labour and suffer reproach</span>] The balance of ms. authority is for the omission of ‘both’ and the substitution of ‘strive,’ ‘wrestle,’ for ‘suffer reproach.’ The internal appropriateness which has been thought to require the latter seems altogether from the foregoing paraphrase to suit the change: a superficial adaptation of this passage to the somewhat similar ‘faithful saying’ of <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:...">2 Timothy 2:11-12</a> may have caused the reading ‘suffer reproach.’ But the tone here and in Ep. to Titus is ‘work,’—the buoyant tone of one who has been set free to ‘labour in the Lord:’ in 2 Tim. the deeper shade of ‘suffering’ has settled on the prison cell. Accordingly in his peroration in ch. <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a> St Paul takes up the word and metaphor, ‘Fight the good fight of the faith;’ while in <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2 Timothy 4:7</a> he looks back from the prison cell on his own strife as finished, ‘I have fought the good fight.’ The metaphor had long been a favourite with him, e.g. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm" title="And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>, where the word is translated in full by R.V., ‘Every man <span class="ital">that striveth in the games</span> is temperate in all things.’ See Appendix, E, and K.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we trust</span>] More correctly ‘we have hoped and still hope’ the ‘larger hope,’ that God is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘love indeed<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And love Creation’s final law.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The perfect expresses a ‘Hope that never lost her youth.’ The aorist has less ms. authority.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Saviour of all men</span>] In a lower sense; (1) for the body, in the supply of a present earthly care, and in the blessing of all earth’s good gifts, through His living love, the curse being removed through Christ’s coming; (2) for the soul, in the supply of the light of Christ to the conscience, such that where revelation has not come, the soul can still live, if it will, the life of God here through Christ unrecognised and hereafter through Christ revealed. ‘I am the light of the world,’ <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>; ‘That was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world,’ <a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">specially of those that believe</span>] In a higher sense; (1) through the Christian’s quickened enjoyment of all earth’s beauties and happinesses, and the transmuting of earthly losses into gains; (2) through the Christian’s response of Faith to Love. ‘That life which I <span class="ital">now</span> live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith which is in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me,’ <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; ‘He that followeth Me shall not walk in the darkness but shall have the light of life,’ <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>.
