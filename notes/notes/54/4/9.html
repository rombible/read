Now we find one of these taken apparently from a Christian hymn, now from one of the public prayers or thanksgivings. The “faithful saying,” in this instance, was that “godliness,” that is, “active, living piety,” is profitable for all things, seeing it has the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/4-9.htm" title="This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation....">1 Timothy 4:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">This </span>— Concerning the advantage of godliness; <span class="ital">is a faithful saying </span>— A saying as important as it is true; <span class="ital">and worthy of all acceptation</span> — That is, of entire credit, and of the most earnest and continued attention and regard. <span class="ital">For, therefore </span>— On this account, because we are assured of the excellence and necessity of this godliness, and of the advantages attending it in time and in eternity; <span class="ital">we both labour and suffer reproach </span>— Take all manner of pains, and undergo all kinds of hardships, regarding neither wealth, nor honour, nor pleasure, nor any thing this world can offer; <span class="ital">because we trust — </span><span class="greekheb">Ηλπικαμεν</span>, <span class="ital">we have trusted, and at present do trust, </span>(the word denoting continuation of action,) <span class="ital">in the living God </span>— Rest on him for the performance of his promises, fully persuaded he will give the life and felicity he has promised; <span class="ital">who is the Saviour of all men </span>— Saving them from many evils, and supplying them with manifold mercies; preserving them in this life, and willing to save them eternally; but <span class="ital">especially </span>— In a more eminent manner, is he the Saviour <span class="ital">of those that believe </span>— Saving them from their sins here, and from the consequences of them hereafter. <span class="ital">These things command and teach </span>— For they are of infinite importance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:6-10 Outward acts of self-denial profit little.

The gain of godliness lies much in the promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him.
