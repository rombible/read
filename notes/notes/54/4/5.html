Thus all food is sanctified, not only, or even chiefly, by the common formula of a Christian grace before meat. This too often degenerates into a mere form of words—into lip-service of the most heartless form—and is too often looked upon as a kind of religious charm. The sanctification referred to by St. Paul belongs to no one prayer or grace, but to the constant habit of referring everything to God as the giver of all—to the perpetual “office” of a devout heart which, taking everything as a gift from God, the lover and the friend of man, thanks God from the heart continually.<p>One, if not the oldest, form of a Christian grace before meat is the one found in the Apostolic Constitutions. It is very simple and beautiful, and perhaps not too long for daily use. It runs as follows: “Blessed be Thou, O Lord, who nourisheth men from very youth up, who givest meat to all flesh; fill our hearts with joy and gladness, so that we, always enjoying a sufficiency, may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom be ascribed to Thee glory, honour, and power unto the ages.

This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For it is sanctified by the word of God - By the authority or permission of God.

Just as in the Lord's Supper, the thanksgiving prayer sanctifies the elements, separating them from their naturally alien position in relation to the spiritual world, and transferring them to their true relation to the new life. So in every use of the creature, thanksgiving prayer has the same effect, and ought always to be used (1Co 10:30, 31).<p>by the word of God and prayer&#8212;that is, "by means of intercessory prayer" (so the Greek)&#8212;that is, consecratory prayer in behalf of "the creature" or food&#8212;that prayer mainly consisting of "the word of God." The Apostolic Constitutions [7.49], give this ancient grace, almost wholly consisting of Scripture, "Blessed art thou, O Lord, who feedest me from my youth, who givest food to all flesh: Fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that we, having all sufficiency, may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom glory, honour, and might, be to thee for ever. Amen." In the case of inspired men, "the word of God" would refer to their inspired prayers (1Ki 17:1); but as Paul speaks in general, including uninspired men's thanksgiving for meals, the "word of God" more probably refers to the Scripture words used in thanksgiving prayers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For it is sanctified:</span> <span class="ital">sanctified</span> in this place signifies made pure, or lawful to be used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By the word of God; </span> by the gospel, which declares it so, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a></span>; or by God’s ordination, which hath so determined it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And prayer; </span> and prayer to God for a blessing upon it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For it is sanctified,....

It is less suitable to say, with Wiesinger, that “the <span class="greekheb">κτίσις</span> being burdened with a curse, is subject to <span class="greekheb">ματαιότης</span> and the <span class="greekheb">δουλεία τῆς φθορᾶς</span>;” but it is made holy for those who enjoy it by the <span class="greekheb">λόγος Θεοῦ</span>. Wahl and Leo take <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> to be the objective genitive, and interpret it as “oratio ad Deum facta,” which makes the expression synonymous with <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις</span> following it; but <span class="greekheb">λόγος Θεοῦ</span> never occurs in this sense. Other expositors have supposed that reference is made to some particular passage of the Scriptures, either to <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm" title="And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.">Genesis 1:31</a> or <a href="/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a>; but de Wette rightly remarks that the words in that case go quite beyond <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm" title="For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, and touch on the question whether certain meats are clean or unclean. For the same reason, <span class="greekheb">λόγος Θεοῦ</span> cannot mean generally “the expressions of the divine doctrine, the principles of Christianity” (Heydenreich). Since the expression points back to <span class="greekheb">μετὰ εὐχαριστίας</span> in <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm" title="For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, and is closely connected with <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις</span>, it can only mean the word of God occurring in the prayer of thanksgiving (de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee), either in this sense, that the word of thanks itself is called the Word of God, inasmuch as it is the expression of God’s indwelling Spirit, or because the prayer is supposed to consist of the words of Scripture.[156]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Regarding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΝΤΕΥΞΙς</span></span></span>, see <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[156] In the <span class="ital">Apostolic Constitutions</span>, vii. 49, there stands the following grace before meat: <span class="greekheb">εὐλογητὸς εἶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Κύριε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ τρέφων μὲ ἐκ νεότητός μου</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ διδοὺς τροφὴν πάσῃ σαρκί</span>, <span class="greekheb">πλήρωσον χαρᾶς καὶ εὐφροσύνης τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πάντοτε πᾶσαν αὐτάρκειαν ἔχοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">περισσεύωμεν εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἐν Χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ Κυρίῳ ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">διʼ οὗ σοὶ δόξα</span>, <span class="greekheb">τιμὴ καὶ κράτος εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀμήν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm" title="For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.">1 Timothy 4:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάζεται</span>: The use of the present tense here supports the explanation given of <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm" title="For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, and helps to determine the sense in which <span class="greekheb">λόγος θεοῦ</span> is used.

If St. Paul had meant by <span class="greekheb">λόγος θεοῦ</span>, the general teaching of Scripture, or the particular text, <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm" title="And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.">Genesis 1:31</a>, he must have said <span class="greekheb">ἡγίασται</span>. At the same time, the written word was an element in the notion of the writer. <span class="greekheb">λόγος θεοῦ</span> has not here merely its general sense, a divine communication to man; it rather determines the quality of the <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις</span>, as <span class="ital">a scriptural prayer; a prayer in harmony with God’s revealed truth</span>. The examples that have come down to us of grace before meat are, as Dean Bernard notes here, “packed with scriptural phrases”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The best commentary on this verse is the action of St. Paul himself on the ship, when, having “taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat” (<a href="/acts/27-35.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.">Acts 27:35</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Although there is not here any direct reference to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, it is probable that thoughts about it have influenced the language; for the Eucharist is the supreme example of all benedictions and consecrations of material things. And if this be so, the passage has light thrown on it by the language of Justin Martyr and Irenæus about the Prayer of Consecration; <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Justin, <span class="ital">Apol</span>. i. 66. “As Jesus Christ our Saviour, by the word of God (<span class="greekheb">διὰ λόγου θεοῦ</span>) made flesh, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so we have been taught that <span class="ital">the food over which thanks have been given by the word of prayer which comes from him</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὴν διʼ εὐχῆς λόγου τοῦ παρʼ αὐτοῦ εὐχαριστηθεῖσαν τροφήν</span>)—that food from which our blood and flesh are by assimilation nourished—is both the flesh and the blood of that Jesus who was made flesh”. Similarly Irenæus (<span class="ital">Haer</span>. <a href="/context/1_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;...">1 Timothy 4:2-3</a>), “Both the mingled cup, and the bread which has been made, receives upon itself <span class="ital">the word of God</span>, and the Eucharist becomes the body of Christ” (<span class="greekheb">ἐπιδέχεται τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ γίνεται ἡ εὐχαριστία σῶμα Χριστοῦ</span>). Perhaps by <span class="ital">the word of prayer which comes from him</span> Justin means a formula authorised by Christ. It must be added that the Prayer Book of Serapion, bishop of Thmuis in Egypt, <span class="ital">circ</span>. A.D. 380, contains an <span class="ital">epiclesis</span> in which we read, “O God of truth, let thy holy Word come to sojourn on this bread, that the bread may become Body of the Word, and on this cup, that the cup may become Blood of the Truth” (Bishop J.

Here perhaps it is chosen as more directly expressing the recognition of God’s particular providence; each recipient of ‘daily bread,’ after reciting the very words of God speaking to him and giving him every good gift, is to speak in his turn face to face with God and pray with thankful heart for blessings to others, ‘<span class="ital">Our</span> Father, give <span class="ital">us</span> our daily bread.’ The <span class="ital">whole</span> life of a Christian (and therefore everything of which he partakes) is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The bearing of this passage on the social and religious question of total abstinence from alcoholic drink is seen in the following note of Fairbairn; all the better because he is evidently not thinking specially of that particular form of abstinence:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Scripture indeed does not deny that a person may occasionally abstain from certain meats or from marriage, with advantage to his own spiritual life or the good of the kingdom of God (<a href="/context/matthew/6-16.htm" title="Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast.

But in such cases the alternative is not put as between a relatively pure and perfect state by the one course, and an impure or defective one by the other; but the one is presented merely as affording opportunities or helps for prosecuting more freely and unreservedly the work of faith than can well be done in the other. If temporary fasting should dispose and enable one to fight more successfully against the lusts of the flesh, or if by abstaining from marriage one could in particular spheres of labour, or in certain conjunctures of the Church’s history, more effectually serve the interests of the Gospel than otherwise, then the higher principles of that Gospel, the nobler ends of a Christian calling, will undoubtedly justify the restraint or the sacrifice. But to do this is only to subordinate a less to a greater good: it creates no factitious distinctions in respect to the allowable or forbidden, holy or unholy, in the ordinary relationship and circumstances of life; and calls for a rejection of the natural good in these only when it may be conducive as means to a definite spiritual end.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm" title="For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.">1 Timothy 4:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἁγιάζεται</span>, <span class="ital">is sanctified</span>) <a href="/leviticus/19-24.htm" title="But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD with.">Leviticus 19:24</a>.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ λόγου Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">by the word of God</span>) The word of God enters into all <span class="ital">thanksgiving</span>, nay, also into the <span class="ital">creation</span> and <span class="ital">granting</span> of meats.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐντεύξεως</span>, <span class="ital">and intercessory</span> [or <span class="ital">consecratory</span>] <span class="ital">prayer</span>) It is the duty of the children of God to <span class="ital">offer intercessory</span> [ch. <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a>; or <span class="ital">consecratory</span>] <span class="ital">prayer</span> for the creatures which they use.

The declaration confirms the last clause of <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>. Thanksgiving to God has a sanctifying effect. The food in itself has no moral quality (<a href="/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14</a>), but acquires a holy quality by its consecration to God; by being acknowledged as God's gift, and partaken of as nourishing the life for God's service.

Scripture is not called "the Word of God." The Word of God includes much more than Scripture: but Scripture contains the Word of God, and the thanksgiving at table was in the words of Scripture.
