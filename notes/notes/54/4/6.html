Not a few, probably, in that Ephesian flock had been won over by the persuasive words of the false teachers to attribute a peculiar virtue to such practices—practices which, if persevered in, St. Paul well knew would tend to set up for imitation in the Church an unreal, unhealthy standard of life.<p><span class= "bld">Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ.</span>—A high title to honour, this, “a good minister of Jesus Christ,” and one Timothy would well earn if he would set himself in all earnestness to oppose and discredit the sickly teaching of the Ascetic school.<p>He would by such opposition, indeed, earn the “title to honour,” for St. Paul well knew how great was the danger of a comparatively young and ardent disciple like Timothy being attracted by such mistaken teachings of perfection. But “the good minister of Jesus Christ” must teach “a life” which may be led by all, not by a select few merely, of the believers on his Master. Asceticism is too often a winning and attractive school of teaching to ministers, as, at a comparatively easy price, they win a great, but at the same time thoroughly unhealthy, power over the souls of men and women who practise these austerities, which tend necessarily to remove them out of the stream of active life.<p><span class= "bld">Nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine.</span>—The Greek present participle rendered here “nourished up in,” marks a continuous and permanent process of self-education. It might be translated “ever training thyself”—a wise and never-to-be-forgotten precept of St. Paul’s, this reminder to his own dear son in the faith, Timothy—and through Timothy to all Christian ministers of every age—never to relax their efforts for self-improvement. The education of the good minister of Jesus Christ is never to be considered finished. He—the teacher of others—must ever be striving himself after a higher and a yet higher knowledge in things spiritual.<p><span class= "bld">Whereunto thou hast attained.</span>—More accurately translated, <span class= "ital">which thou hast closely followed.</span> In the teaching respecting faith and practice which Timothy, as a disciple, has diligently followed out step by step—in that teaching he is to study to advance yet farther, so as to gain deeper and ever deeper knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained....">1 Timothy 4:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">If thou put the brethren in remembrance, </span>&c. — <span class="greekheb">Ταυτα υποτιθεμενος τοις αδελφοις</span>, <span class="ital">suggesting these things to the brethren, </span>concerning the lawfulness of all sorts of meats, and concerning the corrupt doctrines and practices which are to arise in the church; <span class="ital">thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ </span>— And shalt act as may be expected from one who has been <span class="ital">nourished up </span>— From his very childhood; <span class="ital">in the words of faith </span>— Words laying a foundation for faith, and the means of producing it in men’s hearts; <span class="ital">and good doctrine </span>— True, genuine, gospel doctrine; <span class="ital">whereunto </span>— That is, <span class="ital">to the knowledge of which, thou hast attained </span>— So <span class="greekheb">η παρηκολουθηκας </span>may be properly translated.

What will it avail us to mortify the body, if we do not mortify sin? No diligence in mere outward things could be of much use. The gain of godliness lies much in the promise; and the promises to godly people relate partly to the life that now is, but especially to the life which is to come: though we lose for Christ, we shall not lose by him.

They are, therefore, proper subjects to preach upon. It is the duty of the ministry to show to the people of their charge what "is" error and where it may be apprehended, and to caution them to avoid it.<p>Nourished up in the words of faith - That is, you will be then "a good minister of Jesus Christ, as becomes one who has been nourished up in the words of faith, or trained up in the doctrines of religion." The apostle evidently designs to remind Timothy of the manner in which he had been trained, and to show him how he might act in accordance with that. From one who had been thus educated, it was reasonable to expect that he would be a faithful and exemplary minister of the gospel.<p>Whereunto thou hast attained - The word used here means, properly, to accompany side by side; to follow closely; to follow out, trace, or examine. It is rendered "shall follow," in <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>; "having had understanding," in <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>; and "hast fully known," in <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>. It does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. The meaning here seems to be, that Timothy had followed out the doctrines in which he had been trained to their legitimate results; he had accurately seen and understood their bearing, as leading him to embrace the Christian religion. His early training in the Scriptures of the Old Testament <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>, he had now fully carried out, by embracing the Lord Jesus as the Messiah, and by evincing the proper results of the early teaching which he had received in connection with that religion. If he now followed the directions of the apostle, he would be a minister of the Lord Jesus, worthy of the attainments in religious knowledge which he had made, and of the expectations which had been formed of him. No young man should, by neglect, indolence, or folly, disappoint the reasonable expectations of his friends. Their cherished hopes are a proper ground of appeal to him, and it may be properly demanded of every one that he shall carry out to their legitimate results all the principles of his early training, and that he shall be in his profession all that his early advantages make it reasonable to "expect" that he will be. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Either of all the main and principal things already mentioned in the preceding chapters; as that the end of the commandment is love; that Christ's coming into the world to save the chief of sinners is a faithful saying, and worthy of acceptation; that prayers should be made for all sorts of men, for the reasons given; and that there is salvation for men and women through the incarnate Son of God; that such and such are the qualifications of elders and deacons; and that the incarnation of Christ is, without controversy, the great mystery of godliness: or of the things which are particularly hinted at in the prophecy delivered in the beginning of this chapter; as that there should be a falling off from the doctrine of faith in the latter days; that this should come to pass through attending to erroneous spirits, and doctrines of "demons", and through the lies of hypocritical, hardened, and infamous men; whose particular dogmas, by which they might be known, would be, to forbid marriage to certain persons, which is of divine institution and honourable, and to order an abstinence from meats at certain times, contrary to the will and providence of God. These the apostle would have Timothy propose, and subject to consideration, and from time to time refresh the memories of the saints with, who are apt, through negligence and inattention, and the weakness of the natural faculty, to be forgetful hearers of the word; that whenever such persons should arise, they might be on their guard against them. It is one part of the business of Gospel ministers to put the churches in mind of what they have received and known, and are established in. By "the brethren" are meant the members of the church at Ephesus; whom the apostle accounted as brethren, being of the same family and household, and would have Timothy reckon and use as such, and not as subjects and servants, to be lorded over. <p>Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ; a minister of Jesus Christ is one of his making, qualifying, calling, and sending; and who makes Christ, the doctrines respecting his person and offices, his grace, righteousness, and salvation, the subject of his ministry; and he is a good one, who, besides having a good work of grace wrought in him, has good gifts and abilities from Christ, and who makes a good use of them, and freely and fully imparts them for the good of others; and being employed in a good work, he abides in it, and nothing can deter or remove him from it; and such an one was Timothy, and so would it be manifest by doing what the apostle hints unto him; as well as he would appear to be <p>nourished up in the words of faith, and of good doctrine: by which are meant the truths of the Gospel, called the words of faith, because they are things to be believed, hold forth the object of faith, Christ, and are the means by which faith comes, and is increased: and good doctrine, being the doctrine of the Scriptures, and of Christ, and of his apostles, and according to godliness; and contain good things, which make for the glory of the grace of God, and the comfort and welfare of immortal souls. These are of a nourishing nature; they are the wholesome and salutary words of Christ; they have in them milk for babes, and meat for strong men; by which both grow and thrive, when error eats as does a canker. So Philo the Jew (k) speaks of the soul, being "nourished with sciences", and not with food and drink, which the body needs; and a little after he says, you see the food of the soul what it is, it is the continual word of God. Now Timothy, by discharging his work aright, would show to the brethren, that as he had been nourished and trained up, first under his religious parents, and then under the Apostle Paul; so he still continued in the same truths, and to live and feed upon them, and to be nourished by them: or the words may be rendered actively, <p>nourishing; that is, either himself, as the Syriac version renders it, or others; for though all nourishment comes from Christ the head, yet it is ministered by joints and bands to the members; it is conveyed by the means of the word and ordinances, ministered by the preachers of the Gospel, who feed the church with knowledge, and with understanding; and none but those who are nourished themselves are fit to be the nourishers of others; and such an one was this evangelist: for it follows, <p>whereunto thou hast attained; he had arrived to a considerable degree of knowledge of Gospel truths, and was still pursuing and following on to know more of them, and was exhorted to continue in them, knowing of whom he had learned them. All this is said by way of encouragement to him to do as the apostle directs. <p>(k) Allegor. l. 2. p. 90, 92. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> attained.</span><p>(9) The conclusion with an exhortation to Timothy, to propound these things diligently to the churches, which he had gotten from the apostle even as though he were being fed.<p>(f) Never departing from it in the least.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.">1 Timothy 4:6</a>. After describing the heretics, the apostle turns again to Timothy, exhorting him, in the first place, with special regard to the matters last under discussion, and then more generally in regard to the duties of his office.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ταῦτα ὑποτιθέμενος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς</span>] <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> does not, as Heydenreich supposes, pass over all intermediate matter and go back to the christological doctrines expressed in <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. It is more correct, with Hofmann, to refer it to the whole section from <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a> to <a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm" title="For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.">1 Timothy 4:5</a> (so Chrysostom); but possibly also Paul had in view only the prohibitions of the heretics (Wiesinger; van Oosterzee doubtfully).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑποτίθεσθαι</span> (the middle only here, the act. in <a href="/romans/16-4.htm" title="Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.">Romans 16:4</a>), properly: “put under the hand or foot,” may also mean “instruct” (Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiq</span>. i. 14), as much as “advise” or “command” (Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell. Jud</span>. ii. 8. 7); here it stands more in the latter sense; Luther: “point out.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hofmann wrongly explains it as equivalent to “take as a theme,” and—against the natural structure of the sentence—connects it with what follows, though in this way it becomes tolerably superfluous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καλὸς ἔσῃ διάκονος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ</span>] Paul here uses <span class="greekheb">διάκονος</span>, inasmuch as Timothy was formally appointed to serve in the work of Christ; it has the same meaning as “so wilt thou well occupy the office committed to thee (<span class="greekheb">διακονία</span>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2 Timothy 4:5</a>).” To this is attached the participial clause: <span class="greekheb">ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] The present participle does not stand for the perfect participle, but brings out how Timothy is to behave at all times, in order to fulfil his commission as a <span class="greekheb">καλὸς διάκονος Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. It declares that he is to be one who makes the words of faith his nourishment. It is inaccurate, therefore, to translate <span class="greekheb">ἐντρεφόμενος</span> by innutritus (Bengel[157]), or “reared” (Luther). As to the meaning of the word <span class="greekheb">ἐντρέφεσθαι</span> (in N. T. a <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγ</span>.), see Philo, <span class="ital">Leg. ad Caj.:</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐνετράφης τοῖς ἱεροῖς γράμμασιν</span>, and Plato, <span class="ital">Leg.</span> vii. 798<span class="ital">a:</span> <span class="greekheb">οἷς γὰρ ἂν ἐντραφῶσι νόμοις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">λόγοι τῆς πίστεως</span> are the words in which faith expresses itself. The added words: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας</span> (see <a href="/1_timothy/1-10.htm" title="For fornicators, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for enslavers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;">1 Timothy 1:10</a>), make the contrast with the heretics more decided, and the further clause: <span class="greekheb">ᾗ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἧς</span>) <span class="greekheb">παρηκολούθηκας</span>, shows that Timothy had hitherto been faithful to pure doctrine. This latter perfect stands in apt contrast with the present participle <span class="greekheb">ἐντρεφόμενος</span>. The original meaning of the verb: “follow near any one,” furnishes naturally for the present context the meaning: “<span class="ital">which thou hast faithfully followed</span>, to which thou hast remained faithful.” The translation; “according to which thou hast formed thyself,” is inaccurate; the word occurs in the N. T. only here and in <a href="/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2 Timothy 3:10</a>, as well as in <a href="/luke/1-3.htm" title="It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,">Luke 1:3</a> and <a href="/mark/16-17.htm" title="And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;">Mark 16:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[157] Bengel, however, did not overlook the signification of the present altogether, since he explains thus: Praesens cum respectu praeteriti, innutritus; nutrimentum perpetuum. Chrysostom remarks <span class="greekheb">τὸ διηνεκὲς τῆς εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα προσοχῆς δηλῶν</span>. Winer says: “<span class="greekheb">ἐντρεφόμενος</span> shows that the <span class="greekheb">λόγοι τῆς πίστεως</span> are to Timothy a permanent means of nourishment and culture.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained....">1 Timothy 4:6-10</a>. The spread of these mischievous notions among the brethren is most effectively discouraged by a demonstration in the person of the minister himself of the positive teaching of the Gospel as to practical life.
