To Paul the aged, his son in the faith seemed still youthful—at this time Timothy could not have been more than forty years of age. The old master would have his young disciple supply the want of years by a gravity of life; he would have him, while fearless, at the same time modest and free from all that pretentious assumption, unhappily so often seen when the comparatively young are placed in positions of dignity and authority. Paul proceeds further to explain his solemn warning by instancing the especial points in which Timothy was to be a pattern to the other believers. These gentle words of warning, such notices as we find in <a href="/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a> and in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1Corinthians 16:10-11</a>, seem to point to the fact of there being nothing <span class= "ital">winning</span> in the personal appearance of Timothy, but rather the contrary. It is deserving of comment that among the more famous of the early Christian leaders, beauty of face and form appears to have been the exception rather than the rule. This was, of course, utterly different from the old Grecian idea of gods and heroes. It was no doubt part of the counsel of God that this world-religion should owe nothing to the ordinary conditions of human success. The teaching was novel and opposed to the maxims which guided and influenced the old world. The noblest ideals proposed for Christian imitation were strange and hitherto unheard of. The very foremost preachers of the faith of Christ, as in the case of Timothy, seem to have owed nothing to those personal gifts so highly prized among Pagan nations. So the appearance of St. Paul, the greatest of the early Christian leaders, seems to have been mean and insignificant, “<span class= "ital">ein armes diirres Männlein</span>” as Luther has it. The blessed Founder of the religion is described by Tertullian, who lived in the same century with those who must have conversed with Christ’s disciples, as “having no human beauty, much less any celestial splendour.” Clement of Alexandria, Justin Martyr, and other very early writers, join in the same testimony. It is, however, only fair to say that on this point the view of Origen appears to have been different. The Messianic prophecies evidently looked forward to this as the will of the Most High. (See <a href="/context/psalms/22-6.htm" title="But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.">Psalm 22:6-7</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-15.htm" title="My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue sticks to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.">Psalm 22:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/22-17.htm" title="I may tell all my bones: they look and stare on me.">Psalm 22:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-14.htm" title="As many were astonished at you; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:">Isaiah 52:14</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/53-2.htm" title="For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2-4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In word.</span>—This refers to the public utterances in teaching and exhortation, but more particularly to the <span class= "ital">words</span> used by Timothy in social intercourse. These, in such a life as that of the young presiding elder of the Ephesian Church, must have been of the deepest importance. The tone of his conversation was no doubt imitated by many, it would influence for good or evil the whole Christian society of that great centre. The words of men placed in such a position should ever be true and generous, helpful and encouraging, and, above all, free from slander, from all low and pitiful conceptions of others.<p><span class= "bld">In conversation.</span>—This rendering might mislead—the Greek word signifies rather “manner of life,” or “conduct.”<p><span class= "bld">In charity.</span>—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">in love.</span> This and the following “in faith,” comprehend the great graces in that inner Christian life of which the “words of the mouth,” and “conduct,” are the outward manifestations.

The ruler of a church—among whose members evidently a school of teaching existed in which a life of stern asceticism was urged on the Christian believer as the only acceptable or even possible way of life for the servant of Christ—must be above all things watchful lest he should seem to set a careless example in the matter of morality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity....">1 Timothy 4:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let no man despise thy youth </span>— That is, let no one have reason to despise it, but conduct thyself with such gravity, wisdom, and steadiness, as, instead of exposing thee to contempt, will rather gain thee respect and reverence.

Study the Scriptures diligently, and read and expound them to the people, whose instructer thou art appointed to be. “Enthusiasts, observe this! expect no end without the means.” — Wesley. “Besides reading the Jewish Scriptures to the brethren in their assemblies for worship, after the example of the synagogue, Timothy was here directed to read these Scriptures in private likewise for his own improvement, (<a href="/1_timothy/4-15.htm" title="Meditate on these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all.">1 Timothy 4:15</a>,) that he might be able to confute the Jews and Judaizers, who founded their errors on misinterpretations of them. Thus understood, the direction, as the ancient commentators observe, is a useful lesson to the ministers of the gospel in all ages. For if a teacher, who possessed the spiritual gifts, was commanded to read the Scriptures for improving himself in the knowledge of the doctrines of religion, how much more necessary is that help to those teachers who must derive all their knowledge of the gospel from the Scriptures, and who cannot, without much study, be supposed to know the customs, manners, and opinions alluded to in these writings.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:11-16 Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities and follies. Those who teach by their doctrine, must teach by their life. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for wordly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let no man despise thy youth - That is, do not act in such a manner that any shall despise you on account of your youth. Act as becomes a minister of the gospel in all things, and in such a way that people will respect you as such, though you are young. It is clear from this that Timothy was then a young man, but his exact age there is no means of determining. It is implied here:<p>(1) that there was danger that, by the levity and indiscretion to which youth are so much exposed, the ministry might be regarded with contempt; and,<p>(2) that it was possible that his deportment should be so grave, serious, and every way appropriate, that the ministry would not be blamed, but honored. The "way" in which Timothy was to live so that the ministry would not be despised on account of his youth, the apostle proceeds immediately to specify.<p>But be thou an example of the believers - One of the constant duties of a minister of the gospel, no matter what his age. A minister should so live, that if all his people should closely follow his example, their salvation would be secure, and they would make the highest possible attainments in piety. On the meaning of the word rendered "example," see the notes on <a href="/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a>.<p>In word - In "speech," that is, your manner of conversation.

There should be nothing in your contact with the other sex that would give rise to scandal. The papists, with great impropriety, understand this as enjoining celibacy - as if there could be no "purity" in that holy relation which God appointed in Eden, and which he has declared to "be honorable in all" <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>, and which he has made so essential to the wellbeing of mankind. If the apostle had wished to produce the highest possible degree of corruption in the church, he would have enjoined the celibacy of the clergy and the celibacy of an indefinite number of nuns and monks. There are no other institutions on the earth which have done so much to corrupt the chastity of the race, as those which have grown out of the doctrine that celibacy is more honorable than marriage. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Let no man despise thy youth&#8212;Act so as to be respected in spite of thy youth (1Co 16:11; Tit 2:15); compare "youthful" as to Timothy (2Ti 2:22). He was but a mere youth when he joined Paul (Ac 16:1-3). Eleven years had elapsed since then to the time subsequent to Paul's first imprisonment. He was, therefore, still young; especially in comparison with Paul, whose place he was filling; also in relation to elderly presbyters whom he should "entreat as a father" (1Ti 5:1), and generally in respect to his duties in rebuking, exhorting, and ordaining (1Ti 3:1), which ordinarily accord best with an elderly person (1Ti 5:19).<p>be thou an example&#8212;Greek, "become a pattern" (Tit 2:7); the true way of making men not to despise (slight, or disregard) thy youth.<p>in word&#8212;in all that thou sayest in public and private.<p>conversation&#8212;that is, "behavior" the Old English sense of the word.<p>in charity &#8230; faith&#8212;the two cardinal principles of the Christian (Ga 5:6).

Timothy was now a young man; some think he was about three and twenty years of age; but he might be older, and yet be so called. Saul is said to be a young man, when he held the clothes of them that stoned Stephen, when he must be at least thirty years of age, some say thirty five; since thirty years after that he styles himself Paul the aged, when he must be sixty years of age and upwards, <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>. Young men are sometimes honoured by God with great gifts, for usefulness both in church and state, as Samuel, David, Solomon, Daniel, and his companions: nor should they be despised on account of their age, when they have gifts suitable to their office, and behave well in it, but, on the contrary, ought to be esteemed for their works' sake; and such should take care that no man has an opportunity or reason to treat them with contempt on that account: the apostle's sense is, either that Timothy, being in office, should not suffer any man to use him contemptuously; but exert his power and authority, and magnify his office, and not allow men to trample upon him, or use him ill, though he was a young man; which sense suits with the preceding words: or rather his meaning is, that he would have him so conduct and behave himself, as he had taught him to behave, in the house and church of God, and so fill up his place and office, and live such an exemplary life and conversation, that there might be no occasion for any to despise his age, or him, on the account of it: and this agrees with what follows, <p>but be thou an example of the believers; the members of the church, before called brethren, from their relation to one another, and here believers, from their concern with Christ, the object of their faith; a more honourable character cannot be given of men, though treated with great contempt in this age of infidelity. The Mahometans would engross this character to themselves, calling themselves the believers, and reckoning all others infidels; but to them only it belongs, who believe in Christ unto righteousness and life everlasting. Now sometimes young men may be examples to older ones; and all that are in office in the church, especially in the ministry, whether old or young, should be ensamples to the flock, and that in the following things: "in word"; meaning either the word of truth, the doctrine of the Gospel; by delivering that which is according to the rule of God's word, showing in it uncorruptness, gravity, and sincerity, and by holding it fast; all which may for the imitation of others, to receive the pure doctrine and retain it: or rather this may respect common discourse; which should not be corrupt, filthy, nor foolish; but should be always with grace, Seasoned with salt, or should be grave and serious, wise and prudent, pleasant, profitable, and edifying. <p>In conversation; in the family, church, and world; which should be as becomes the Gospel of Christ, in all godliness and honesty, with simplicity and godly sincerity; so as to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, recommend it to others, stop the mouths of gainsayers, and obtain a good report of them that are without. <p>In charity; in love to God, to Christ, and one another; without which, if a man has the tongue of men and angels, or ever such great and excellent gifts, he is nothing. <p>In spirit; in the exercise of spiritual gifts; in spiritual talk and conversation; and in fervency of spirit, or true zeal for the honour of God, the glory of the Redeemer, the spread of his Gospel, truths, and ordinances, and the support of the same. This clause is wanting in the Alexandrian and Claromontane copies, and in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions. <p>In faith; in the exercise of the grace of faith; in holding fast the profession of faith; and in retaining the doctrine of faith, with all integrity, faithfulness, and constancy, standing fast in it, striving and contending for it. <p>In purity; or chastity of body, in opposition to all impurity of the flesh, by fornication, adultery, and the like; which was very proper to be suggested to a young man: though this may also have respect to all that is before said, as to purity of language, conversation, love, zeal, and faith. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</span><p>(14) Now he returns to that exhortation, showing what are the true virtues of a pastor, by which he may come to be reverenced even though he is young, that is, such speech and life as are witnesses of charity, zeal, faith, and purity.

We cannot but observe that there is a certain order in the succession of the words. First we have <span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀναστροφῇ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Λόγος</span> includes every kind of speaking (not merely <span class="ital">doctrine</span>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> teaching, exhorting, warning, comforting, etc., both in public assemblies and in private intercourse. <span class="greekheb">Ἀναστροφή</span> is the life as embodied in deeds. Word and life are the two forms of revealing the inner hidden disposition. To this inner life we are directed by the next words: <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πίστει</span>, which denote the powers that give motion to the Christian life. The last word: <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἁγνείᾳ</span>, gives, finally, the nature of the life that is rooted in faith and love. The word does not denote here specially chastity in the relation of sex, but generally “purity of moral behaviour” (Hofmann); comp. <span class="greekheb">ἁγνός</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge!

(See Moulton and Milligan, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, vi., viii. 432). The meaning of this direction is qualified by the following <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τύπος γίνου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. It means, <span class="ital">Assert the dignity of your office even though men may think you young to hold it. Let no one push you aside as a boy</span>. Compare the corresponding direction <a href="/titus/2-15.htm" title="These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you.">Titus 2:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">μηδείς σου περιφρονείτω</span>. On the other hand, St. Paul shows Timothy “a more excellent way” than self-assertion for the keeping up of his dignity: Give no one any ground by any fault of character for despising thy youth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σου</span> depends on <span class="greekheb">τῆς νεότητος</span>. Field supports this by an exact parallel from Diodorus Siculus. The two genitives do not, in strict grammar, depend on <span class="greekheb">καταφρον</span>., <span class="ital">despise thee for thy youth</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς νεότητος</span>: St. Paul had met Timothy on the second missionary journey, dated by Harnack in A.D. 47, and by Lightfoot in A.D. 51. About the year 57, St. Paul says of Timothy, “Let no man despise him” (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-11.htm" title="Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brothers.">1 Corinthians 16:11</a>). 1 Tim. may be dated not more than a year before St. Paul’s martyrdom, which Harnack fixes in A.D. 64, and Lightfoot in A.D. 67. The question arises, Could Timothy’s <span class="greekheb">νεότης</span> have lasted all that time, about fifteen or sixteen years? We must remember that we have no information about Timothy’s age when he joined St. Paul’s company. But if he had been then fifteen or sixteen, or even seventeen, <span class="greekheb">νεότης</span> here need cause no difficulty. Lightfoot (<span class="ital">Apostolic Fathers</span>, Part II. vol. i. p. 448) adduces evidence from Polybius and Galen to show that a man might be called <span class="greekheb">νεός</span> up to the age of thirty-four or thirty-five. In any case, the terms “young” and “old” are used relatively to the average age at which men attain to positions in the world. Forty is reckoned old for a captain in the army, young for a bishop, very young for a Prime Minister. In an instructive parallel passage, Ignatius commends the Magnesians (§ 3) and their presbyters for not presuming upon the youth of their bishop. For Timothy’s comparative youth, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὰς δὲ νεωτερικὰς ἐπιθυμίας φεῦγε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τύπος γίνου</span>: For the sentiment, compare reff. and <a href="/1_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="Why I beseech you, be you followers of me.">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>, <a href="/philippians/4-9.htm" title="Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.">Php 4:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τύπος</span> is followed by the genitive of the person for whose edification the <span class="greekheb">τύπος</span> exists in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm" title="Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-3.htm" title="Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.">1 Peter 5:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the following enumeration, <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> is coupled with <span class="greekheb">ἀναστροφή</span> as <span class="ital">words</span> with <span class="ital">deeds</span> (<a href="/romans/15-18.htm" title="For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,">Romans 15:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>).

It is an especial favourite of St Peter’s, noun and verb occurring 10 times in his short Epistles. The five words describe five stages, from the most defined external to the most defined internal characteristics—speech, behaviour, love, faith, purity; <span class="ital">love</span> as it were belonging equally to the inner and the outer self, and combining all. ‘The greatest is love.’ Yet the special emphasis is on ‘purity,’ the word itself occurring only here and in <a href="/1_timothy/5-2.htm" title="The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.">1 Timothy 5:2</a>, though another form of the word is used in the similar catalogue, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>. The same connexion of ‘youth’ and ‘purity’ is in St Paul’s mind in <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm" title="Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, ‘flee also youthful lusts.’ Timothy, at 36 years, was young compared with St Paul and the presbyters.
