The impression left upon our minds by the words of this and the preceding verse is that St. Paul had given up all hope of living himself to see the dawn of that awful day, but he deemed it more than probable that his son in the faith would live to witness it. Hence his words to him: “Keep the commandment without spot <span class= "ital">until</span> the Epiphany of our Lord Jesus Christ.”<p><span class= "bld">Who is the blessed and only Potentate.</span>—The stately and rhythmical doxology with which the solemn charge to Timothy is closed was not improbably taken from a hymn loved by the Ephesian Christians, and often sung in their churches; the words, then, were, likely enough, familiar to Timothy and his people, though now receiving a new and deeper meaning than before. Well might Timothy, as example to the flock of Ephesus, keep “the commandment without spot, unrebukeable”—fearlessly, even though danger and death were presented before him as the sure reward of his faithfulness—for He who in His own times should reveal (show) the Lord Jesus returning to earth in glory, was inconceivably greater and grander than any earthly potentate, king, or lord, before whose little throne Timothy might have to stand and be judged for his faithfulness to the “only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.”<p>Of the first of these sublime titles, God is termed “the blessed,” or <span class= "ital">the happy, </span>because He is the source of all blessedness and happiness; and the “only Potentate,” in solemn assertion that the Christian’s God was One, and that to none save to Him could this appellation “only Potentate” be applied. Possibly already in Ephesus the teachers of Gnosticism had begun their unhappy work—with their fables of the mighty æons, and their strange Eastern conception of one God the source of good, and another the source of evil.<p><span class= "bld">The King of kings, and Lord of lords.</span>—God is king over those men style kings, and lord over all men call lords here.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-16 It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost.

The wording of the discouragement given by Jesus, in <a href="/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>, to those who would pry into the future makes it natural to suppose that this latter notion chiefly was in St. Paul’s mind here (<span class="greekheb">καιροὺς οὓς ὁ πατὴρ ἔθετο ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ</span>). We may perhaps put it thus: A devout mind recognises the providential ordering of past events as having taken place at the time best fitted for them, and shrinks from the presumption of guessing the appropriate time for future events. Thus there is no presumption in saying “When the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son”; and when the time is ripe, He will send Him again (<a href="/acts/3-20.htm" title="And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached to you:">Acts 3:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δείξει</span>: Ell. well explains the force of this verb from <a href="/john/2-18.htm" title="Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign show you to us, seeing that you do these things?">John 2:18</a>, <span class="greekheb">τί σημεῖον δεικνύεις ἡμῖν</span>; The last <span class="greekheb">ἐπιφάνεια</span> will be the final <span class="ital">proof</span> offered by God to the human race.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The terms of this magnificent characterisation of God are an expansion of the epithets in the doxology in <a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.

The choice of the phrase <span class="greekheb">μόνος δυν</span>. here was perhaps suggested by the thought of His absolute and irresponsible power in arranging the times and seasons for the affairs of men. It is unnecessary to seek any special polemical object in <span class="greekheb">μόνος</span>, as exclusive of dualism. As has been already suggested (on <a href="/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.
