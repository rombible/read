he now sums up the teaching contained in these words by pithily remarking. “Yes, for the love of money is the root of all evil,” meaning thereby, not that every evil <span class= "ital">necessarily must</span> come from “love of money,” but that there is no conceivable evil which can happen to the sons and daughters of men which <span class= "ital">may</span> not spring from covetousness—a love of gold and wealth.<p><span class= "bld">Which while some coveted after.</span>—There is a slight irregularity in the image here, but the sense of the expression is perfectly clear. It is, of course, <span class= "ital">not</span> the “love of money,” strictly speaking, which “some have coveted after,” but the money itself. The thought in the writer’s mind probably was—The man coveting gold longs for opportunities in which his covetousness (love of money) may find a field for exercise. Such inaccuracies in language are not uncommon in St. Paul’s writings, as, for instance, <a href="/romans/8-24.htm" title="For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?">Romans 8:24</a>, where he writes of “hope that is seen.”<p><span class= "bld">They have erred from the faith.</span>—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">they have wandered away from the faith.</span> This vivid picture of some who had, for sake of a little gold, given up their first love—their faith—was evidently drawn by St. Paul from life. There were <span class= "ital">some</span> in that well-known congregation at Ephesus, once faithful, now wanderers from the flock, over whom St. Paul mourned.<p><span class= "bld">And pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span>—The language and the thoughts of <a href="/psalms/16-4.htm" title="Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.">Psalm 16:4</a> were in St. Paul’s mind when he wrote these words—“Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another (god).” The “many sorrows” here are, no doubt, the “gnawings of conscience,” which must ever and anon harass and perplex the man or woman who, for covetousness’ sake, has deserted the old paths, and has wandered away from the old loved communion of Christ.<p>The imagery used in this tenth verse seems to be that of a man who wanders from the straight, direct path of life, to gather some poisonous, fair-seeming root growing at a distance from the right road on which he was travelling. He wanders away and plucks it; and now that he has it in his hands he finds himself pierced and wounded with its unsuspected thorns.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:6-10 Those that make a trade of Christianity to serve their turn for this world, will be disappointed; but those who mind it as their calling, will find it has the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. He that is godly, is sure to be happy in another world; and if contented with his condition in this world, he has enough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into this world; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries of life bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavour to be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said, they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness in wealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that are such, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them to use dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains. Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business, as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading to connexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men be drawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet not love it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Every sort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the love of money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this, especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and loose profession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the love of money is the root of all evil - That is, of all kinds of evil. This is evidently not to be understood as literally true, for there are evils which cannot, be traced to the love of money - the evils growing out of ambition, and intemperance, and debasing lusts, and of the hatred of God and of goodness. The expression here is evidently a popular saying - "all sorts of evils grow out of the love of money." Similar expressions often occur in the classic writers; see Wetstein, in loc, and numerous examples quoted by Priceaus. Of the truth of this, no one can doubt. No small part of the crimes of the world can be traced to the love of gold. But it deserves to be remarked here, that the apostle does not say that "money is the root of all evil," or that it is an evil at all. It is the "love" of it which is the source of evil.<p>Which while some coveted after - That is, some who were professing Christians. The apostle is doubtless referring to persons whose history was known to Timothy, and warning him, and teaching him to warn others, by their example.<p>They have erred from the faith - Margin, "been seduced." The Greek is, they have been led astray from; that is, they have been so deceived as to depart from the faith. The notion of deception or delusion is in the word, and the sense is, that, deceived by the promises held out by the prospect of wealth, they have apostatized from the faith. It is not implied of necessity that they were ever real Christians. They have been led off from truth and duty, and from all the hopes and joys which religion would have imparted.<p>And pierced themselves through with many sorrows - With such sorrows as remorse, and painful reflections on their folly, and the apprehension of future wrath. Too late they see that they have thrown away the hopes of religion for that which is at best unworthy the pursuit of an immortal mind; which leads them on to a life of wickedness; which fails of imparting what it promised when its pursuit is successful, and which, in the great majority of instances, disappoints its votaries in respect to its attainment. The word rendered "pierced themselves through" - &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  periepeiran - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and is a word whose force and emphasis cannot be well expressed in a translation. It is from &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;  peiro&#772;, and is made more emphatic by the addition of the preposition &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;  peri. The word &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;  peiro&#772;, means, properly, "to pierce through from one end to another," and is applied to meat that is "pierced through" by the spit when it is to be roasted (Passow); then it means to pierce through and through. The addition of the preposition &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;  peri to the word, conveys the idea of doing this "all round;" of piercing everywhere. It was not a single thrust which was made, but they are gashed all round with penetrating wounds. Such is the effect on those who cast off religion for the sake of gold. None can avoid these consequences who do this. Every man is in the hands of a holy and just God, and sooner or later he must feel the effects of his sin and folly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the love of money&#8212;not the money itself, but the love of it&#8212;the wishing to be rich (1Ti 6:9)&#8212;"is a root (Ellicott and Middleton: not as English Version, 'the root') of all evils." (So the Greek plural). The wealthiest may be rich not in a bad sense; the poorest may covet to be so (Ps 62:10). Love of money is not the sole root of evils, but it is a leading "root of bitterness" (Heb 12:15), for "it destroys faith, the root of all that is good" [Bengel]; its offshoots are "temptation, a snare, lusts, destruction, perdition."<p>coveted after&#8212;lusted after.<p>erred from&#8212;literally, "have been made to err from the faith" (1Ti 1:19; 4:1).<p>pierced&#8212;(Lu 2:35).<p>with &#8230; sorrows&#8212;"pains": "thorns" of the parable (Mt 13:22) which choke the word of "faith."

Of all the evils before mentioned, and of others; not money itself, as silver and gold, which are God's creatures, and his gifts, and may be used to, and answer many good purposes; but the love of it, and not any love of it; for there may be a lawful love of it, and desire after it, so far as it is requisite to the necessaries of life, to answer the calls of Providence, the duties we owe to God and men, to serve the interest of Christ, and do good to fellow creatures and fellow Christians: but it is an immoderate insatiable desire after it, and an inordinate love of it, which is here meant, such as is properly idolatry: as when a man loves it, not only besides, but above God; serves it as if it was God, and places his trust and confidence in it, independent of God, and his providence; such love of it is the source and spring of all iniquity, as above; it was the sin of Judas, and the root of all his iniquity. The phrase is Jewish. So idolatry is said to be  , "the root of all iniquities" (q); see <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a><p>which while some coveted after; in a greedy and insatiable way: <p>they have erred from the faith; the doctrine of faith. Observing that the professors of it are generally poor, they have declined that path, and have not so much as heard the word; and if they have heard and embraced it, yet when persecution arises because of it, they drop their profession of it; or else their minds are so filled with worldly cares, and deceitful riches, that the word is choked, and becomes unprofitable, and by and by, Demas like, they forsake it, having loved this present world. <p>And pierced themselves through with many sorrows; riches are therefore fitly compared to thorns, which give great trouble and uneasiness, both in getting and keeping them; and oftentimes the reflection upon the unlawful ways and means made use of to obtain them, gives very pungent pain and distress; see <a href="/job/20-15.htm">Job 20:15</a>. The apostle seem to allude to the Hebrew word  used for a covetous man, which signifies one that pierces, cuts, and wounds, as such an one does both himself and others. <p>(q) R.

Hofmann’s interpretation is artificial. He makes <span class="greekheb">ὀρέγεσθαι</span> denote here “the grasping of a man after something out of his way,” and “the thing after which he reaches sideways is said to be the plant which afterwards proves to be to him a root of all evils,” so that <span class="greekheb">ἧς</span> does not refer to <span class="greekheb">φιλαργυρία</span>, but to <span class="greekheb">ῥίζα πάντων τῶν κακῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπεπλανήθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς πίστεως</span>] The reason of this is the inner connection between faith and blessedness.

The force of <span class="greekheb">περί</span> in this compound is intensive, as in <span class="greekheb">περιάπτω</span>, <span class="greekheb">περικαλύπτω</span>, <span class="greekheb">περικρατής</span>, <span class="greekheb">περικρύπτω</span>, <span class="greekheb">περίλυπος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὀδύναις πολλαῖς</span>: There is a touch of pity in this clause, so poignantly descriptive of a worldling’s disillusionment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_timothy/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">the love of money</span>] One word in the original, occurring only here and belonging to the later Greek; the adjective in <a href="/luke/16-14.htm" title="And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.">Luke 16:14</a>, ‘the Pharisees, who were covetous,’ R.V. ‘lovers of money,’ and so <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2 Timothy 3:2</a>. ‘It differs from the ordinary word for covetousness (e.g. <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>) (which does not occur in these Epistles) in denoting rather avarice, a love of money already gained, than an active grasping after more.’ Trench’s <span class="ital">N. T. Synonyms</span>, § 24.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the root of all evil</span>] It has been much questioned whether we are to translate this admitted predicate ‘a root’ or ‘the root.’ On the general grammatical question, such passages as <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, ‘the head of the woman is (the) man,’ make ‘the root,’ quite correct; if with R.V. we render ‘a root,’ it <span class="ital">lays a stress</span> on there being other roots, which is beside the point: the stress surely is on the ‘all,’ interpreted however in that <span class="ital">rhetorical</span> sense, if it may be so called, which is common in N. T. as elsewhere (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;">1 Timothy 6:17</a></span>), and is well given in R.V. We may translate <span class="bld">the root of all kinds of evil</span>. For this use of the plural we may compare ‘supplies of food,’ <span class="ital"><a href="/1_timothy/6-8.htm" title="And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.">1 Timothy 6:8</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which while some coveted after</span>] ‘Which (love-of-money) some reaching after,’ R.V. keeping to the root-notion of the participle. The verb (and its noun) occur four times in N. T. and in each place the Revisers give a different version, <a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1 Timothy 3:1</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm" title="But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.">Hebrews 11:16</a> in a good sense; here and <a href="/romans/1-27.htm" title="And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.">Romans 1:27</a> in a bad sense. ‘Desire,’ a colourless word, would fit everywhere, but is weak. Bp Wordsworth ingeniously explains the seemingly incongruous desire for the love-of-money thus: ‘riches were a proof of divine approbation: love of wealth was a love of God’s favour: thus they sanctified <span class="ital">avarice</span>.’ But the relative is only <span class="ital">formally, logically</span>, in agreement with the abstract. ‘love-of-money:’ all readers of A.V. or R.V. would refer the ‘which’ to the real antecedent in sense, ‘money,’ and would be virtually right.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have erred from the faith</span>] R.V. is justified in rendering <span class="bld">have been led astray</span>. The Greek aorist ‘merely represents the action of having occurred, as filling a point of past time’ (Winer, iii., xl. 45, a). When it stands by itself, as here, with no qualifying word, this force is represented by the English perfect, as giving just in our idiom the past verbal idea merely, with no further stress or point, cf. Ellicott on <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>. The word occurs in N.T. again only in <a href="/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>, ‘that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect.’ ‘The faith’ as in <a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm" title="Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:">1 Timothy 1:19</a>, where see note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pierced themselves through</span>] Lat. <span class="ital">transfigo</span>; only here in N.T.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm" title="For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.">1 Timothy 6:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πάντων τῶν κακῶν</span>, <span class="ital">of all evils</span>) For it destroys faith, the root of all that is good: at first sight, the love of money seems to take away the nutriment or food that supports many crimes, as luxury, wantonness, etc.; but it is in reality the root of all evils. All evils in <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1 Timothy 6:9</a> are comprehended under <span class="ital">temptation, a snare, lusts, destruction, perdition;</span> although the article <span class="greekheb">τῶν</span> does not precisely relate to those evils, but is added to <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>, according to custom, for the purpose of amplifying or heightening the effect, without its relative power.—<span class="greekheb">φιλαργυρία</span>, <span class="ital">the love of money</span>) When money is loved for itself, it is not used for procuring “food and raiment.”—<span class="greekheb">ἧς</span>) <span class="greekheb">φιλαργυρίας</span>, viz. <span class="greekheb">ἀργύρου</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τινὲς</span>) <span class="ital">some:</span> the Ephesians, ch. <a href="/1_timothy/5-15.htm" title="For some are already turned aside after Satan.">1 Timothy 5:15</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὀρεγόμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">having coveted</span>) ch. <a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1 Timothy 3:1</a>, note [having <span class="ital">grasped</span> at].—<span class="greekheb">ὀδύναις πολλαῖς</span>, <span class="ital">with many sorrows</span>) of the conscience, producing remorse for property badly acquired; also of the mind, urging to the laying up of more.

Alford also quotes a striking passage from Diog. Laert., in which he mentions a saying of the philosopher Diogenes that "the love of money (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the metropolis, or home, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>." <span class="cmt_word">Reaching after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). It has been justly remarked that the phrase is slightly inaccurate. What some reach after is not "the love of money," but the money itself. To avoid this, Hofmann (quoted by Luther) makes <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;</span> the antecedent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;</span>, and the metaphor to be of a person turning out of his path to grasp a plant which turns out to he not desirable, but a root of bitterness. This is ingenious, but hardly to be accepted as the true interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Pierced themselves through</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and rare in classical Greek. But the simple verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>, to "pierce through," "transfix," applied 'especially to "spitting" meat, is very common in Homer, who also applies it metaphorically exactly as St. Paul does here, to grief or pain. <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "pierced with pain" ('Il.,' 5:399). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Love of money (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>N.T.o.
