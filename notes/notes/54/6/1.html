It entered into all grades and ranks. It was common to all peoples and nations. The very fabric of society seemed knit and bound together by this miserable institution. War and commerce were equally responsible for slavery in the Old World. To attempt to uproot it—to preach against it—to represent it in public teaching as hateful to God, shameful to man—would have been to preach and to teach rebellion and revolution in its darkest and most violent form. It was indeed the curse of the world; but the Master and His chosen servants took their own course and their own time to clear it away. Jesus Christ and His disciples, such as St. Paul and St. John, left society as they found it, uprooting no ancient landmarks, alarming no ancient prejudices, content to live in the world as it was, and to do its work as they found it—trusting, by a new and lovely example, slowly and surely to raise men to a higher level, knowing well that at last, by force of unselfishness, loving self-denial, brave patience, the old curses—such as slavery—would be driven from the world. Surely the result, so far, has not disappointed the hopes of the first teachers of Christianity.<p>This curse at least is disappearing fast from the face of the globe. St. Paul here is addressing, in the first place, Christian slaves of a Pagan master. Let these, if they love the Lord and would do honour to His holy teaching, in their relations to their earthly masters not presume upon their new knowledge, that with the Master in Heaven “there was no respect of persons;” that “in Jesus Christ there was neither bond nor free, for all were one in Christ.” Let these not dream for an instant that Christianity was to interfere with the existing social relations, and to put master and slave on an equality on earth. Let these, by their conduct to unbelieving masters, paying them all loving respect and honour, show how the new religion was teaching them to live.<p><span class= "bld">That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</span>—There would indeed be a grave danger of this, if the many Christian slaves, instead of showing increased zeal for their masters’ service, should, as the result of the teaching of the new society they had joined, become morose, impatient of servitude, rebellious. Very soon in Pagan society would the name of that Redeemer they professed to love, and the beautiful doctrines He had preached, be evil spoken of, if the teaching were for one moment suspected of inculcating discontent or suggesting rebellion. An act, or course of acting, on the part of professed servants of God which gives occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, is ever reckoned in Holy Scripture as a sin of the deepest dye. Compare Nathan’s words to King David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm" title="However,, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.">2Samuel 12:14</a>) and St. Paul’s reproach to the Jews (<a href="/romans/2-24.htm" title="For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.">Romans 2:24</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed....">1 Timothy 6:1-2</a></span>. Because the law of Moses (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2</a>) did not allow Israelites to be made slaves for life, without their own consent, it seems the Judaizing teachers, with a view to allure slaves to their party, encouraged them in disobeying the commands, of their masters. This doctrine the apostle condemns here, as in his other epistles, (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-20.htm" title="Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called....">1 Corinthians 7:20-22</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>,) by enjoining Christian slaves to obey their masters, whether believers or unbelievers. <span class="ital">Let servants </span>— Or <span class="ital">slaves, </span>rather; (see on <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>, and <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>;) <span class="ital">under the yoke </span>— Of heathen masters; <span class="ital">count them worthy of all honour </span>— All the honour due from a servant to a master, and show it by their obedience and respectful behaviour. <span class="ital">That the name of God </span>— God himself; <span class="ital">and his doctrine </span>— The doctrine of the gospel; <span class="ital">be not blasphemed </span>— That is, evil spoken of, as tending to destroy the political rights of mankind. <span class="ital">And they that have believing masters </span>— Which for any to have is a great privilege; <span class="ital">let them not despise them </span>— Pay them the less honour or obedience; <span class="ital">because they are brethren </span>— In Christ, believers; and in that respect on a level with them.

And by sweetening the temper of masters, and inspiring them with benevolence, it renders the condition of slaves more tolerable than formerly. For, in proportion as masters imbibe the true spirit of the gospel, they will treat their slaves with humanity, and even give them their freedom, when their services merit such a favour.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">These things teach and exhort </span>— Thus Paul the aged gives young Timothy a charge to dwell upon practical holiness. Less experienced teachers are apt to neglect the superstructure, while they lay the foundation. But of so great importance did St. Paul see it to enforce <span class="ital">obedience </span>to Christ, as well as to preach <span class="ital">faith </span>in his blood, that after urging the life of faith on professors, (<a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>,) he even adds another charge for the strict observance of it, <a href="/1_timothy/6-13.htm" title="I give you charge in the sight of God, who vivifies all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;">1 Timothy 6:13</a>, &c.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 Christians were not to suppose that religious knowledge, or Christian privileges, gave them any right to despise heathen masters, or to disobey lawful commands, or to expose their faults to others. And such as enjoyed the privilege of living with believing masters, were not to withhold due respect and reverence, because they were equal in respect to religious privileges, but were to serve with double diligence and cheerfulness, because of their faith in Christ, and as partakers of his free salvation. We are not to consent to any words as wholesome, except the words of our Lord Jesus Christ; to these we must give unfeigned consent. Commonly those are most proud who know least; for they do not know themselves. Hence come envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings, disputes that are all subtlety, and of no solidity, between men of corrupt and carnal minds, ignorant of the truth and its sanctifying power, and seeking their worldly advantage.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let as many servants - On the word here rendered "servants" - &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  douloi - see the notes on <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>. The word is that which was commonly applied to a slave, but it is so extensive in its signification as to be applicable to any species of servitude, whether voluntary or involuntary. If slavery existed in Ephesus at the time when this Epistle was written, it would be applicable to slaves; if any other kind of servitude existed, the word would be equally applicable to that. There is nothing in the word itself which essentially limits it to slavery; examine <a href="/matthew/13-27.htm">Matthew 13:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27</a>; <a href="/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44</a>; <a href="/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29</a>; <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>; <a href="/acts/2-18.htm">Acts 2:18</a>; <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>; <a href="/acts/16-17.htm">Acts 16:17</a>; <a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; Jde 1:1; <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>. The addition of the phrase "under the yoke," however, shows undoubtedly that it is to be understood here of slavery.<p>As are under the yoke - On the word yoke, see the notes on <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. The phrase here properly denotes slavery, as it would not be applied to any other species of servitude; see <a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>; Dem. 322, 12. &#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  zeugos doulosune&#772;s. Robinson's Lexicon. It sometimes denotes the bondage of the Mosaic law as being a severe and oppressive burden; <a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>. It may be remarked here that the apostle did not regard slavery as a light or desirable thing. He would not have applied this term to the condition of a wife or of a child.<p>Count their own masters worthy of all honour - Treat them with all proper respect. They were to manifest the right spirit themselves, whatever their masters did; they were not to do anything that would dishonor religion. The injunction here would seem to have particular reference to those whose masters were not Christians. In the following verse, the apostle gives particular instructions to those who had pious masters. The meaning here is, that the slave ought to show the Christian spirit toward his master who was not a Christian; he ought to conduct himself so that religion would not be dishonored; he ought not to give his master occasion to say that the only effect of the Christian religion on the mind of a servant was to make him restless, discontented, dissatisfied, and disobedient. In the humble and trying situation in which he confessedly was - under the yoke of bondage - he ought to evince patience, kindness, and respect for his master, and as long as the relation continued he was to be obedient. This command, however, was by no means inconsistent with his desiring his freedom, and securing it, if the opportunity presented itself; see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>; compare, on the passage before us, the <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a> notes, and <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a> note.<p>That the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed - That religion be not dishonored and reproached, and that there may be no occasion to say that Christianity tends to produce discontent and to lead to insurrection. If the effect of religion had been to teach all who were servants that they should no longer obey their masters, or that they should rise upon them and assert their freedom by violence, or that their masters were to be treated with indignity on account of their usurped rights over others, the effect would have been obvious. There would have been a loud and united outcry against the new religion, and it could have made no progress in the world. Instead of this, Christianity taught the necessity of patience, and meekness, and forbearance in the endurance of all wrong - whether from private individuals <a href="//biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-41</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>, or under the oppressions and exactions of Nero <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>, or amidst the hardships and cruelties of slavery. These peaceful injunctions, however, did not demonstrate that Christ approved the act of him "that smote on the one cheek," or that Paul regarded the government of Nero as a good government, - and as little do they prove that Paul or the Saviour approved of slavery. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>1Ti 6:1-21.

If this be the case, away with their God and their doctrine too. Wherefore the apostle exhorts, that if believing servants have any regard to that name they are called by, and call upon, and to the doctrine of the Gospel they have embraced and professed; that they would be obedient and respectful to their masters; that they may have no occasion to speak reproachfully of God, and of the Gospel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> that the name of God and <i>his</i> doctrine be not blasphemed.</span><p>(1) He adds also rules for the servant's duty towards their masters: upon which matter there were no doubt many questions asked by those who took occasion by the Gospel to trouble the normal manner of life.

The only possible construction is this, that <span class="greekheb">οἱ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι</span> forms the subject, <span class="greekheb">πιστοὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπητοί</span> the predicate; for the article shows that the words <span class="greekheb">οἱ τῆς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. do not give a more precise definition of what precedes. Most recent expositors (de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Plitt, also hitherto in this commentary) understand by <span class="greekheb">ἡ εὐεργεσία</span> the kindness which the slaves show to their masters by faithful service, and explain <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλαμβάνεσθαι</span> as equivalent to “receive, accept;” but this explanation cannot be justified by usage.[198] In the N. T. the word occurs only in <a href="/luke/1-54.htm" title="He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;">Luke 1:54</a> and <a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>, in the sense of “accept of some one.” This sense it has also in classic Greek, when it refers to persons; in reference to things, it means: “carry on something eagerly,” also: “make oneself master of a thing.” Hofmann accordingly is not incorrect in translating: “devote themselves to kindness, making it their business.” If we keep strictly to this meaning, as indeed we must, then the words <span class="greekheb">οἱ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εὐεργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι</span> apply to the Christian masters in regard to their conduct towards their slaves, so that the meaning of the exhortation is: “<span class="ital">Serve</span> (your masters) <span class="ital">all the more, that they, devoting themselves to kindness towards you, are believers and beloved</span> (of God).” So rightly Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">οἱ τῆς εὐεργεσίας ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστι</span>: <span class="greekheb">οἱ δεσπόται οἱ φροντίζοντες τοῦ εὐεργετεῖν τοὺς δούλους</span>; so, too, Chrysostom, Grotius, Wegscheider, Leo, and others. De Wette, against this explanation, maintains that “it makes the predicate ‘believing, somewhat superfluous, because the masters, being kindly towards their slaves, are already showing their Christian faith in action.” He is wrong; for, on the one hand, <span class="greekheb">εὐεργεσία</span> towards slaves might be true even of heathen; and, on the other, Paul wishes to insist on the Christian belief of the masters as a motive for careful and faithful service. Hofmann is wrong in thinking that <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλαμβ</span>. does not depend on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, but forms an independent clause in this sense, that the slaves who serve their masters willingly in distributing their alms, are beloved (viz. by their fellow-Christians). This view is opposed not only by the <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (for to what previous sentence is it to be attached?), but also by this, that whereas the <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι</span> are the slaves, <span class="greekheb">τῶν δεσπότων</span> is arbitrarily supplied with <span class="greekheb">εὐεργεσίας</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The apostle concludes the exhortations given in regard to the slaves with the words: <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα δίδασκε καὶ παρακάλει</span>, which Lachm. Buttm. and Tisch. wrongly refer to what follows; comp. <a href="/1_timothy/4-11.htm" title="These things command and teach.">1 Timothy 4:11</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/5-7.htm" title="And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.">1 Timothy 5:7</a>; the right construction is given by de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[198] De Wette wrongly seeks to justify this meaning by saying that <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλαμβάνεσθαι</span> also means: “perceive with the senses,” and that in Porphyrias, <span class="ital">De Abstin.</span> i. 46, it means: <span class="greekheb">μήτε ἐσθίων πλειόνων ἡδονῶν ἀντιλήψεται</span>. Though the Vulg. translates it: “qui beneficii participes sunt,” and Luther: “and are partakers of the benefit,” the word is taken in a sense foreign to it. The same is true of Heydenreich’s explanation: “<span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνοὶ τῆς χάριτος</span>” (<a href="/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>), wherein he also arbitrarily takes <span class="greekheb">εὐεργεσία</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed....">1 Timothy 6:1-2</a>.

The use of the word is derived from the old custom of making prisoners of war pass under a ‘yoke’ formed of a spear laid crosswise on two upright spears, to denote the yoke of slavery being laid upon them. The reference in Christ’s words, <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm" title="Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.">Matthew 11:29</a>, ‘take my yoke’ is rather to the yoke coupling cattle for drawing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">their own masters</span>] The adjective here rendered ‘their own’ is in N.T. ‘used instead of a personal pronoun by the same kind of misuse as when in later Latin <span class="ital">proprius</span> takes the place of <span class="ital">eius</span> or <span class="ital">suus</span>;’ Winer, § 22, 7. As Alford on <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:22</a> says, it serves ‘to intensify the relationship and enforce its duties.’ We have sixteen instances of the use in these Epistles, e.g. <a href="/titus/2-9.htm" title="Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;">Titus 2:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>his <span class="ital">doctrine</span>] Again the special <span class="bld">teaching</span> of the Christian religion, which would be ‘evil spoken of’ by being supposed to teach a subversive socialism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1, 2</span>. Timothy’s duties in regard to slaves<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The last of the four sections of special charge (commenced in the previous chapter) is Timothy’s attitude towards Christian slaves. The position taken by Christ and His apostles in regard to slavery and the whole ‘social order’ of the world is well known. The existing basis of society with its relationships was recognised; while the eternal principles of Christian equality and love were boldly proclaimed, and trusted, as the true solvents of all that was amiss between man and man in God’s own time and His own patient way of working both for the material and spiritual world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The present teaching of St Paul, an echo of similar exhortations (<a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>), is in entire harmony with the Divine wisdom of the Master’s oracle ‘Render unto Cæsar the things which be Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.’ Nothing is more wonderful in the life of Christianity than the slow gradual establishment of women’s position in the family, and of social and civil freedom in the state, in accordance with the seed-principles of Christ’s law; unless it be watching the same growth (hardly yet more than infantile), in the wider sphere of international brotherhood and the signs of a ‘Christian conscience’ stirring in the intercourse of state with state.
