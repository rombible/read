Those who exposed themselves to the winning temptations and deadly sins he was about to speak of were not “the rich,” but those who longingly plan to be rich.<p><span class= "bld">Fall into temptation.</span>—Those longing to be rich will fall into the temptation to increase their worldly goods, even at the sacrifice of principle.

This premature breaking up of the earthly tabernacle is the herald and precursor of the final perdition of the immortal soul.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:6-10 Those that make a trade of Christianity to serve their turn for this world, will be disappointed; but those who mind it as their calling, will find it has the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. He that is godly, is sure to be happy in another world; and if contented with his condition in this world, he has enough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into this world; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries of life bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavour to be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said, they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness in wealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that are such, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them to use dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains. Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business, as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading to connexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men be drawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet not love it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Every sort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the love of money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this, especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and loose profession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But they that will be rich - Further to enforce the duty of contentment, the apostle refers to some of the evils which necessarily attend a desire to be rich. Those evils have been so great and uniform in all ages, and are so necessary accompaniments of that desire, that, even amidst many inconveniences which may attend the opposite condition, we should he contented with our lot. Indeed, if we could see all, it would only be necessary to see the evils which the desire of wealth produces in the world, to make us contented with a most lowly condition of life. Perhaps nothing more would be necessary to make a poor man satisfied with his lot, and grateful for it, than to be acquainted with the perplexities and cares of a rich man. There is more emphasis to be placed on the word will, here, in the phrase, "will be rich," than might be supposed from our translation. It is not the sign of the future tense, but implies an actual "purpose" or "design" to become rich - &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  hoi boulomenoi. The reference is to those in whom this becomes the object of earnest desire, and who lay their plans for it.<p>Fall into temptation - That is, they are tempted to do wicked things in order to accomplish their purposes. It is extremely difficult to cherish the desire to be rich, as the leading purpose of the soul, and to he an honest man.<p>And a snare - Birds are taken in a snare, and wild beasts were formerly; see the notes on <a href="//biblehub.com/job/18-8.htm">Job 18:8-9</a>. The net was sprung suddenly upon them, and they could not escape. The idea here is, that they who have this desire become so entangled, that they cannot easily escape. They become involved in the meshes of worldliness and sin; their movements are so fettered by cares, and inordinate desires, and by artificial needs, that they are no longer freemen. They become so involved in these things, that they cannot well break away from them if they would; compare <a href="/proverbs/28-20.htm">Proverbs 28:20</a>.<p>And into many foolish and hurtful lusts - Desires, such as the love of wealth creates. They are foolish - as being not such as an intelligent and immortal being should pursue; and they are hurtful - as being injurious to morals, to health, and to the soul. Among those desires, are the fondness for display; for a magnificent dwelling, a train of menials, and a splendid equipage; for sumptuous living, feasting, the social glass, company, and riotous dissipation.<p>Which drown men in destruction and perdition - The word which is here rendered, "drown" - &#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  buthizo&#772; - means, to "sink in the" deep, or, "to cause to sink;" and the meaning here is, that they become submerged as a ship that sinks. The idea of drowning is not properly that of the apostle, but the image is that of a wreck, where a ship and all that is in it go down together. The destruction is complete. There is a total ruin of happiness, of virtue, of reputation, and of the soul. The ruling desire to be rich leads on a train of follies which ruins everything here, and hereafter. How many of the human family have thus been destroyed! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. will be rich&#8212;have more than "food and raiment." Greek, "wish to be rich"; not merely are willing, but are resolved, and earnestly desire to have riches at any cost (Pr 28:20, 22). This wishing (not the riches themselves) is fatal to "contentment" (1Ti 6:6). Rich men are not told to cast away their riches, but not to "trust" in them, and to "do good" with them (1Ti 6:17, 18; Ps 62:10).<p>fall into temptation&#8212;not merely "are exposed to temptation," but actually "fall into" it. The falling into it is what we are to pray against, "Lead us not into temptation" (Jas 1:14); such a one is already in a sinful state, even before any overt act of sin.

Not they that are rich; for some rich men are good men; and do much good with their riches; and are as free from temptations and snares, and foolish and hurtful lusts, as other persons, as Abraham, Joseph of Arimathea, Gaius, and others were; but such that would be rich, who labour after, make haste for it, and are resolved upon it, at any rate, right or wrong, as there be thousands, who never attain to it; so that the apostle does not point at rich men particularly, but at such who are determined to be rich, whether they ever are so or not: these <p>fall into temptation; not in such sense in which the phrase is used in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a> but in such sense as Christ uses it, <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a> namely, a falling into temptation to sin, so as to be drawn away by it, and overcome with it: <p>and a snare; the Vulgate Latin version reads, "the snare of the devil", and so Beza's Claromontane copy; which perhaps is taken from <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>, and though this seems not to be the genuine reading, yet it may give the true sense: Satan may be compared to a fowler; his temptations to sin are his nets and snares; and they that will be rich, are the birds that are caught and entangled therein, out of which sometimes it is impracticable to extricate themselves: <p>and into many foolish and hurtful lusts; carnal and worldly lusts, the lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, which are the things that are in the world and draw the affections to them; yea, what sin is there but such persons may, and do fall into; as defrauding of the neighbour, oppressing the poor, lying, perjury, theft, murder, rapine, violence, and injustice of every kind? so that they may be said to be "many", and some of them are "foolish". All sin is folly, and every wicked man is a foolish one, and acts a part quite contrary to reason; but some evil ways are notoriously silly, weak and foolish, and which they that will be rich make use of to get money; though others of them are sly and artful enough, and all of them are "hurtful" to their credit and reputation, or to the health of their bodies, and especially to the welfare of their immortal souls. So the phrase , "their foolish lust", is used by the Targumist in <a href="/ezekiel/20-25.htm">Ezekiel 20:25</a> and the corruption of nature in general is by the Jews called the old and foolish king, in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:13</a>.

We are also to note that what is here condemned is not an ambition to excel in some lawful department of human activity, which though it may bring an increase in riches, develops character, but the having a single eye to the accumulation of money by any means. This distinction is drawn in <a href="/proverbs/28-20.htm" title="A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.">Proverbs 28:20</a> : “A faithful man shall abound with blessings: But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐμπίπτουσιν</span>.

There would be the <span class="ital">genius loci</span> to whisper ‘si possis, recte; si non, quocunque modo, rem;’ ‘ye know that by this business we have our wealth.’ Hence the specially appropriate warning now addressed to <span class="bld">those that are desiring to be rich</span>, as we must render exactly.

Herbert’s words are still better (<span class="ital">Priest to the Temple</span>, c. 3), ‘The country parson is very circumspect in avoiding all covetousness, neither being greedy to get, nor niggardly to keep, nor troubled to lose any worldly wealth; but in all his words and actions slighting and disesteeming it, even to a wondering that the world should so much value wealth, which in the day of wrath hath not one dram of comfort for us.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">temptation and a snare</span>] There seems no reason to depart from the usual rendering elsewhere of the phrase ‘into temptation’ as R.V. does ‘into a temptation,’ because of the words coupled with it; ‘a snare’ naturally follows, just as ‘deliver us from the evil one’ follows ‘bring us not into temptation,’ <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>; it is the thought present to the Apostle’s mind at this time; see above <a href="/1_timothy/3-7.htm" title="Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.">1 Timothy 3:7</a>, ‘lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil’ where the conjunction of words is very similar, and from whence some mss. have even added here ‘of the devil;’ and <a href="/2_timothy/2-26.htm" title="And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.">2 Timothy 2:26</a>, ‘that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil.’ See Appendix, K.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lusts, which drown men</span>] The lengthened generalised relative here is properly ‘of a kind which,’ ‘which indeed naturally,’ so R.V. <span class="bld">such as</span>. Cf. <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1 Timothy 3:15</a>. The simple use of the passive of ‘drown’ in <a href="/luke/5-7.htm" title="And they beckoned to their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.">Luke 5:7</a>, ‘they were being sunk,’ is the only other N. T. use of the verb; the noun from which it comes is used by St Paul of his (unrecorded) shipwreck, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>, ‘a night and a day I have been in <span class="ital">the deep</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">destruction and perdition</span>] The two words give solemnity to the idea of the ruin to be incurred, though it is too much to assign ‘ruin of body’ to the one and ‘ruin of soul’ to the other. The compound word is instinctively chosen (see <span class="ital"><a href="/1_timothy/6-8.htm" title="And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.">1 Timothy 6:8</a></span>) to complete the terrible picture.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chrysostom gives many instances of these ‘snares and lusts’ in his day leading to ‘destruction and perdition.’ To the example (almost forced upon the memory by the word) from Holy Scripture itself of ‘the son of perdition’ (<a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>), may well be added G. Herbert’s searching words to his brethren; ‘they, who, for the hope of promotion, neglect any necessary admonition or reproof sell (with Judas) their Lord and Master.’ <span class="ital">The Priest to the Temple</span>, ch. 2.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1 Timothy 6:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Βουλόμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">wishing</span>) This <span class="ital">wish</span> is the enemy of <span class="ital">a mind contented with its lot;</span> it is not the wealth itself (that is the enemy of contentment): rich men are not therefore commanded to cast away their wealth, <a href="/context/1_timothy/6-17.htm" title="Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;...">1 Timothy 6:17-18</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πλουτεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to be rich</span>) to have more than food and clothing.—<span class="greekheb">ἐμπίπτουσι</span>—<span class="greekheb">βυθίζουσι</span>, <span class="ital">fall into—drown</span>) A sad gradation.—<span class="greekheb">πειρασμὸν</span>) There is a Paronomasia [the signification of a word changed by a slight change of the letters]: <span class="greekheb">πορισμὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">πειρασμὸς</span>. <span class="ital">Temptation</span> is opposed to ‘food,’ likewise to faith: <span class="ital">a snare</span> is opposed to ‘clothing’ and to righteousness: ‘<span class="ital">lusts</span>’ are opposed to “a contented mind.”—<span class="greekheb">παγίδα</span>, <span class="ital">a snare</span>) Therefore they do not find <span class="greekheb">πόρον</span>, true <span class="ital">gain</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὄλεθρον</span>, <span class="ital">destruction</span>) of the body.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπώλειαν</span>, <span class="ital">perdition</span>) also of the soul: comp. <span class="ital">of all</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm" title="For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.">1 Timothy 6:10</a>.
