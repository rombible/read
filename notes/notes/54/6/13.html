So he charges him as in the tremendous presence of God.<p><span class= "bld">Who quickeneth all things.</span>—The older authorities adopt here a reading which implies, <span class= "ital">who keepest</span> <span class= "ital">alive, </span>or <span class= "ital">preservest, all things.</span> The Preserver rather than the Creator is here brought into prominence. Timothy is exhorted to fight his good fight, ever mindful that he is in the presence of that great Being who could and would—even if Timothy’s faithfulness should lead him to danger and to death—still preserve him, on earth or in Paradise.<p><span class= "bld">And before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession.</span>—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">who before Pontius Pilate bore witness to</span> <span class= "ital">the good confession.</span> The good confession which (<a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1Timothy 6:12</a>) Timothy confessed before many witnesses, Jesus Christ, in the presence of Pilate, had already borne witness to. In other words, Jesus Christ, before Pontius Pilate, bore witness by His own solemn words, that He was the Messiah—the long-looked-for King of Israel. If the preposition which we have, with the majority of expositors, construed “before” (Pontius Pilate) have here its local meaning, the “<span class= "ital">witness</span>” must be limited to the scene in the Judgment Hall—to the interview between the prisoner Jesus and the Roman governor.<p>Although this meaning here seems the most accurate, it is possible to understand this preposition in a <span class= "ital">temporal, </span>not in a local, signification—<span class= "ital">under</span> (that is, <span class= "ital">in the days of</span>) Pontius Pilate—then the “witness” was borne by the Redeemer to the fact of His being “Messiah:” first, by His own solemn words; secondly, by His voluntary death. The confession was that “He, Jesus, was a King, though not of this world.” (See <a href="/matthew/27-11.htm" title="And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say.">Matthew 27:11</a>; <a href="/context/john/18-36.htm" title="Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.">John 18:36-37</a>, where the noble confession is detailed.) He bore His witness with a terrible death awaiting Him. It was, in some respects, a model confession for all martyrs, in so far as it was a bold confession of the truth with the sentence of death before His eyes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/6-13.htm" title="I give you charge in the sight of God, who vivifies all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;...">1 Timothy 6:13-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">I give thee charge, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1 Timothy 5:21</a>; <span class="ital">in the sight </span>— In the presence; <span class="ital">of God </span>— Whose eye is upon us both; and <span class="ital">who quickeneth all things </span>— Who is the source of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal, and therefore is able to raise those from the dead that suffer for him: a suitable, though oblique intimation, that should Timothy, after the example of his great Lord, sacrifice his life to the honour of his profession, God, who raised Christ from the dead, would raise him. See <a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2 Timothy 2:3</a>; <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory....">2 Timothy 2:10-12</a>. The earnestness and solemnity with which the apostle addresses Timothy on this occasion, did not proceed from any suspicion of his fidelity as a minister, but from his own deep sense of the importance of the truths which Timothy was to confess and maintain. Hence the ministers of the gospel may learn that these truths ought to be often and earnestly insisted on by them in their public discourses. <span class="ital">And before </span>— In the presence of; <span class="ital">Jesus Christ, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession </span>— This was made by our Lord most explicitly before Caiaphas and the Jewish council, when, being asked whether he was <span class="ital">Christ, the Son of the Blessed, </span>he acknowledged that he was; and added, <span class="ital">Ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, </span>&c, <a href="/context/mark/14-61.htm" title="But he held his peace, and answered nothing.

There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I give thee charge in the sight God - see the notes on <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>.<p>Who quickeneth all things - Who gives life to all; notes on <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>. It is not quite clear why the apostle refers to this attribute of God as enforcing the charge which he here makes. Perhaps he means to say that God is the source of life, and that as he had given life to Timothy - natural and spiritual - he had a right to require that it should be employed in his service; and that, if, in obedience to this charge and in the performance of his duties, he should be required to lay down his life, he should bear in remembrance that God had power to raise him up again. This is more distinctly urged in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8-10</a>.<p>And before Christ Jesus - As in the presence of Christ, and stimulated by his example.<p>Who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession - Margin, "profession." The same Greek word is used which in <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a> is translated "profession." The reference is to the fact that the Lord Jesus, when standing at the bar of Pilate who claimed to have power over his life, did not shrink from an open avowal of the truth; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36-37</a>. Nothing can be better fitted to preserve our minds steadfast in the faith, and to enable us to maintain our sacred vows in this world when allured by temptation, or when ridiculed for our religion, than to remember the example of the Lord Jesus; Let us place him before us as he stood at the bar of Pilate - threatened with death in its most appalling form, and ridiculed for the principles which he maintained; let us look on him, friendless and alone, and see with what seriousness, and sincerity, and boldness he stated the simple truth about himself, and we shall have one of the best securities that we can have, that we shall not dishonor our profession. A clear view of the example of Christ our Saviour, in those circumstances, and a deep conviction that his eye is upon us to discern whether we are steadfast as he was, will do more than all abstract precepts to make us faithful to our christian calling. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. quickeneth all things&#8212;that is, "maketh alive." But the oldest manuscripts read, "preserveth alive"; as the same Greek means in Ac 7:19; compare Ne 9:6. He urges Timothy to faithfulness here by the present manifestation of God's power in preserving all things, as in 1Ti 6:14, by the future manifestation of God's power at the appearing of Christ. The assurance that "eternal life," 1Ti 6:12, will be the result of "fighting the good fight," rests on the fulness and power of Him who is the God of all life, present and to come.<p>witnessed&#8212;It was the Lord's part to witness, Timothy's part to confess (or "profess," 1Ti 6:12) "the good confession" [Bengel]. The confession was His testimony that He was King, and His kingdom that of the truth (see on [2485]1Ti 6:12; 1Ti 6:15; Mt 27:11). Christ, in attesting, or bearing witness to this truth, attested the truth of the whole of Christianity. Timothy's profession, or confession, included therefore the whole of the Christian truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle’s care of the church showeth itself in these severe charges laid upon Timothy; though one whom he knew to be a faithful minister, he chargeth him, calling God to witness that he had fulfilled his part in laying this charge upon him. The name he here giveth unto God may possibly have a particular reference to the state of the gospel at that time, the doctrine and profession of which had many enemies, and so it is made use of here to comfort and encourage Timothy.

This seems to be mentioned to strengthen Timothy against the fears of death, that should he die in fighting the Lord's battles, he was able to raise him from the dead, and would do it. <p>And before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; or rather "under Pontius Pilate"; or, as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions render it, "in the time of Pontius Pilate"; for this may refer not only to the confession Christ made in his presence, at his examination by him, when he owned himself to be a King, declared the nature of his kingdom, and signified that the end of his incarnation was to bear a testimony to the truth; but it may also refer to the faithful, plain, and open witness Christ bore to truth throughout the whole of his ministry, under Pontius Pilate, by his doctrine and miracles, and at last by his sufferings and death, which he endured under him; and this is mentioned for Timothy's imitation, and to encourage him, and all other saints, to hold fast the profession of their faith to the end. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and <i>before</i> Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</span><p>(10) A most earnest request and charge, to observe and keep all the things faithfully, with our eyes set upon the coming of Jesus Christ, whose glory we have to contrast with the vain glittering of this world, and his power with all the terrors of the wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/context/1_timothy/6-13.htm" title="I give you charge in the sight of God, who vivifies all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;...">1 Timothy 6:13-14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παραγγέλλω σοι</span>] Matthies regards <span class="greekheb">τὴν καλὴν ὁμολογίαν</span> as the subject belonging to this; but against this construction there is both the meaning of the verb and the <span class="greekheb">τηρῆσαί σε</span> following.[204] Leo justly says: quo magis ad finem vergit epistola, eo gravior existit apostoli oratio.

Wiesinger asserts that <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρεῖν</span> never has the latter meaning, but unjustly; because in <a href="/john/5-32.htm" title="There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.">John 5:32</a> we have <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρίαν μαρτυρεῖν</span>, and in <a href="/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.">John 3:11</a> we have <span class="greekheb">ὃ οἴδαμεν λαλοῦμεν καὶ ὃ ἑωράκαμεν μαρτυροῦμεν</span> (<a href="/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-2.htm" title="Who bore record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.">Revelation 1:2</a>). On the contrary, there is no passage to be found where <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρεῖν</span> with the accus. means so much as “confirm the truth of an utterance by a testimony in regard to it.”[205] The first view, therefore, is to be rejected as contrary to usage. Besides, the confession made by Jesus, and Timothy’s confession mentioned in <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>, are not in contents different from one another. De Wette thinks that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΑΡΤΥΡΕῖΝ</span></span></span> “is used here in the well-known ecclesiastical signification, consequently that Christ is represented as the first martyr,” and that the meaning is: “Christ confirmed the confession of the truth by His suffering and death.” This is not only against the usage of the N.

The word has here a special appropriateness. Timothy is stimulated to exhibit moral courage by an assurance that he is in the hands of One whose protective power is universal, and by the example of One who, as Man, put that protective power to a successful test, and was “saved out of death” (<a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν καλὴν ὁμολογίαν</span> must have the same reference here as in the preceding verse. We have seen that in the case of Timothy, it means his baptismal profession of faith in God as revealed by Jesus Christ. In the case of Jesus Himself it is best understood of His habitual sense of His heavenly Father’s presence and protection, which found its supreme expression on the Cross (<a href="/luke/24-46.htm" title="And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:">Luke 24:46</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μαρτυρήσαντος</span>: Although Jesus, as Man, and His followers make the same <span class="greekheb">ὁμολογία</span>, yet their respective relations to it are different. <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρέω</span> indicates a power of origination and authentication which <span class="greekheb">ὁμολογέω</span> does not. The utterances and acts of Jesus, as Man, are human; yet He spoke and acted as no other man ever did. <a href="/matthew/17-27.htm" title="Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go you to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a piece of money: that take, and give to them for me and you.">Matthew 17:27</a> (“That take, and give unto them for <span class="ital">me and thee</span>,” not “for <span class="ital">us</span>”) and <a href="/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a> (“I ascend unto <span class="ital">my</span> Father <span class="ital">and your</span> Father,” etc. not <span class="ital">our</span> Father or <span class="ital">our</span> God) illustrate very well this difference between Jesus and His brethren in relations which they share alike. This is why St. Paul does not here use <span class="greekheb">ὁμολογέω ὁμολογίαν</span> of Christ, but employs instead the unusual <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρέω ὁμολογίαν</span>. Jesus is <span class="greekheb">ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός</span>, <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

Bengel suggests that the two verbs indicate the attitudes of the bystanders in each case: “<span class="ital">confessus est</span>, cum assensione testium: <span class="ital">testatus est</span>, non assentiente Pilato”. The Vulg. treats <span class="greekheb">τὴν καλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁμολ</span>. as an acc. of closer specification, <span class="ital">qui testimonium reddidit sub Pontio Pilato, bonam confessionem</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ Ποντίου Πειλάτου</span>: With the explanation of the <span class="greekheb">ὁμολογία</span> of Jesus which has just been given, it would be natural to render this, with the Vulg., <span class="ital">under Pontius Pilate</span>; and this view is favoured by the change from <span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον</span>, <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>, to <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, and by the likelihood that this is a fragment of a creed. Yet the rendering <span class="ital">before Pontius Pilate</span> (Chrys., etc.), is not inconsistent with the notion that the <span class="greekheb">ὁμολογία</span> in one sense was made all during our Lord’s ministry; for undoubtedly from one point of view it was when Jesus’ life was hanging in the balance, depending on the decision of Pontius Pilate, that His trust in the protective love of His Father was most tried. His calm repose of soul on the assurance of God’s wise and good disposition of events is well illustrated by His words as recorded in <a href="/john/19-11.htm" title="Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.">John 19:11</a>, “Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above”.

As an epithet of "<span class="accented">God</span>," it sets before us the highest creative act of the Almighty as "the Lord, and the Giver of life;" and is equivalent to "the living God" (<a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>), "the God of the spirits of all flesh" (<a href="/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>). The existence of "life" is the one thing which baffles the ingenuity of science in its attempts to dispense with a Creator. <span class="cmt_word">The good confession</span> refers to our Lord's confession of himself as "<span class="accented">the</span> Christ, the Son of <span class="accented">God</span>," in <a href="/matthew/27-11.htm">Matthew 27:11</a>; <a href="/luke/23-3.htm">Luke 23:3</a>; <a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36, 37</a>, which is analogous to the baptismal confession (<a href="/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a> (T.R.); 16:31; 19:4, 5).

The phrase is unique. The good confession is the historical confession of Jesus before Pilate, which is the warrant for the truthfulness of Timothy's confession.
