Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who gave himself a ransom for all - This also is stated as a reason why prayer should be offered for all, and a proof that God desires the salvation of all. The argument is, that as Christ died for all, it is proper to pray for all, and that the fact that he died for all is proof that God desired the salvation of all. Whatever proof of his desire for their salvation can be derived from this in relation to any of the race, is proof in relation to all. On the meaning of the phrase "he gave himself a ransom," see the <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> note; <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a> note; on the fact that it was for "all," see the notes on <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>.<p>See also the Supp. note on the same passage.<p>To be testified in due time - Margin, "a testimony." The Greek is, "the testimony in its own times," or in proper times - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  to marturion kairois idiois. There have been very different explanations of this phrase. The common interpretation, and that which seems to me to be correct, is, that "the testimony of this will be furnished in the proper time; that is, in the proper time it shall be made known through all the world;" see Rosenmuller. Paul affirms it as a great and important truth that Christ gave himself a ransom for all mankind - for Jews and Gentiles; for all classes and conditions of people alike. This truth had not always been understood. The Jews had supposed that salvation was designed exclusively for their nation, and denied that it could be extended to others, unless they became Jews. According to them, salvation was not provided for, or offered to pagans as such, but only on condition that they became Jews. In opposition to this, Paul says that it was a doctrine of revelation that redemption was to be provided for all people, and that it was intended that the testimony to this should be afforded at the proper time. It was not fully made known under the ancient dispensation, but now the period had come when it should be communicated to all; compare <a href="/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a> note, and <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. gave himself&#8212;(Tit 2:14). Not only the Father gave Him for us (Joh 3:16); but the Son gave Himself (Php 2:5-8).<p>ransom&#8212;properly of a captive slave. Man was the captive slave of Satan, sold under sin. He was unable to ransom himself, because absolute obedience is due to God, and therefore no act of ours can satisfy for the least offense. Le 25:48 allowed one sold captive to be redeemed by one of his brethren. The Son of God, therefore, became man in order that, being made like unto us in all things, sin only excepted, as our elder brother He should redeem us (Mt 20:28; Eph 1:7; 1Pe 1:18, 19). The Greek implies not merely ransom, but a substituted or equivalent ransom: the Greek preposition, "anti," implying reciprocity and vicarious substitution.<p>for all&#8212;Greek, "in behalf of all": not merely for a privileged few; compare 1Ti 2:1: the argument for praying in behalf of all is given here.<p>to be testified&#8212;Greek, "the testimony (that which was to be testified of, 1Jo 5:8-11) in its own due times," or seasons, that is, in the times appointed by God for its being testified of (1Ti 6:15; Tit 1:3). The oneness of the Mediator, involving the universality of redemption (which faith, however, alone appropriates), was the great subject of Christian testimony [Alford] (1Co 1:6; 2:1; 2Th 1:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> ’ Antilutron, the word here translated <span class="bld">ransom, </span> is very emphatical; it signifies the exchanging of condition with another, the laying down of one’s life to save another’s. This our Saviour has done for us. The Scripture discovers to us, that <span class="ital">by nature we are the children of wrath, </span> and guilty of many rebellious sins, and devoted to eternal death: being in this deplorable state, the Son of God, moved by his Divine love, undertook our restoring to the favour of God; and voluntarily endured the punishment due to our sins, and gave his most precious blood and life the price of our redemption, <span class="bld"><a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a></span>. If it be objected: How is it consistent with Christ giving <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">himself a ransom for all, </span> that so many perish in their sins? The answer is clear: We must distinguish between the sufficiency of his ransom and the efficacy of it; he paid a ransom worthy to obtain the salvation of all men, and has done whatever was requisite to reconcile God, and make men capable of salvation; but only those who by a lively faith depend upon him, and obey him, are actual partakers of salvation: that is, no person but may be saved in believing; and if men perish, it is not from a defect of righteousness in the Mediator, but from the love of their lusts, and their obstinate rejecting their own mercies. And it is unjust that the glory of his Divine compassion and love should be obscured or lessened for their ungrateful neglect of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who gave himself a ransom for all,.... What the Mediator gave as a ransom for men is "himself", his body and his soul, which were both made an offering for sin; and his life, which is the result of union between soul and body; his whole human nature as in union with his divine person, and so might be truly said to be himself: this he gave into the hands of men, of justice and of death; and that voluntarily, which shows his great love to his people; and also as a "ransom", or a ransom price for them,  in their room and stead; to ransom them from the slavery of sin, and damnation by it, from the captivity of Satan, and the bondage of the law, and from the grave, death, hell, ruin, and destruction: and this ransom was given for "all"; not for every individual of mankind, for then all would be delivered, freed, and saved, whereas they are not; or else the ransom price is paid in vain, or God is unjust to receive a sufficient ransom price from Christ, and yet not free the captive, but punish the person for whom he has received satisfaction; neither of which can be said. But the meaning is, either that he gave himself a ransom for many, as in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> for the Hebrew word  to which this answers, signifies sometimes many, a multitude, and sometimes only a part of a multitude, as Kimchi observes (y): or rather it intends that Christ gave himself a ransom for all sorts of men, for men of every rank and quality, of every state and condition, of every age and sex, and for all sorts of sinners, and for some out of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation, for both Jews and Gentiles; which latter may more especially be designed by all, as they are sometimes by the world, and the whole world; and so contains another argument why all sorts of men are to be prayed for, since the same ransom price is given for them; as that for the children of Israel was the same, for the rich as for the poor. We (z) read, that when the people of Israel comforted the high priest upon the death of his wife, or any relation, they used to say to him, , "we are thy atonement", expiation, or ransom; that is, as the commentators (a) explain it, by us thou shalt be atoned, for we will be in thy room and stead, with respect to all things that shall come upon thee; but here the High priest and Mediator is the atonement and ransom for the people: <p>to be testified in due time; or "a testimony in his own times"; that is, the sum and substance of what is before said is the Gospel, which is a testimony concerning the person, office, and grace of Christ, exhibited in the times of the Messiah, or the Gospel dispensation. Some copies read, "the mystery", which is another word often used for the Gospel; for that that is intended, appears by what follows. <p>(y) Sepher Shorash. rad.

This does not mean, however, that <span class="greekheb">τὸ μαρτύριον</span> denotes Christ’s gift of Himself as a ransom (or “Christ’s sacrifice”), to be “the witness of salvation set forth at the appointed time, the historical fact that the divine purpose of salvation is realized” (Matthies);[93] for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΑΡΤΎΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span> is not the deed itself, but the attestation, the proclamation of the deed; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-6.htm" title="Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:">1 Corinthians 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>.
