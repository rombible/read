So averse was St. Paul to anything which might mar the quiet solemnity of these meetings for prayer and praise and authoritative instruction.<p>This prohibition to speak publicly in assemblies for prayer and praise in the case of Christian women, was renewed in the North African Church, at the Council of Carthage, held A.D. 398. The same Council, however, specially permitted women to teach those of their own sex in private; indeed, the power to teach “ignorant and rustic women” was required as one qualification in deaconesses. The employment of deaconesses as private instructors seems to have been the custom generally in the Eastern Churches.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection....">1 Timothy 2:11-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let the women learn in silence </span>— Let every woman receive instruction in religious matters from the men in silence, in your public assemblies; <span class="ital">with all subjection </span>— With becoming submission to the other sex, neither teaching nor asking questions there. <span class="ital">I suffer not a woman to teach </span>— Namely, publicly; <span class="ital">nor to usurp authority over the man — </span>Which she might seem to do if she officiated under the character of a public teacher.

She is more easily deceived, and more easily deceives. Let it be observed here, however, that the apostle’s doctrine concerning the inferiority of the woman to the man, in point of understanding, is to be interpreted of the sex in general, and not of every individual; it being well known that some women, in understanding, are superior to most men. <span class="ital">The woman being deceived, was </span>first <span class="ital">in the transgression </span>— And prevailed upon Adam, by her solicitations, to transgress also. “The behaviour of Eve, who may be supposed to have been created by God with as high a degree of understanding as any of her daughters ever possessed, ought to be remembered by them all, as a proof of their natural weakness, and as a warning to them to be on their guard against temptation. Perhaps also the apostle mentioned Eve’s transgression on this occasion, because the subjection of women to their husbands was increased at the fall on account of Eve’s transgression, <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-15 Under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particular house of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the woman learn in silence - Listen attentively to instruction, without attempting to teach in public; see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/14-35.htm">1 Corinthians 14:35</a>.<p>With all subjection - With due subjection to those who are in authority, and who are appointed to minister in holy things; notes, <a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. learn&#8212;not "teach" (1Ti 2:12; 1Co 14:34).

Luther has rightly: “that she be master of her husband;” whereas in the translation: “to assume to herself respect or mastery” (Heydenreich, de Wette, van Oosterzee), the notion of assumption is imported. Hofmann, too, is wrong when he says that <span class="greekheb">αὐθεντεῖν</span> in conjunction with the genitive of the person should mean: “to act independently of this person, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as one’s own master” (!).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Many expositors (Matthies, and earlier, Estius, Calovius, and others) assume in this word a reference to domestic relations; whereas Heydenreich, de Wette, Wiesinger, and others, limit even this command to behaviour in the assemblies for divine worship.[105] This last is correct, as is shown by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ ΕἾΝΑΙ ἘΝ ἩΣΥΧΊᾼ</span></span></span>, corresponding to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἩΣΥΧΊᾼ</span></span></span> in <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.">1 Timothy 2:11</a>.

Nor can it be denied that women are not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΘΕΝΤΕῖΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΝΔΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> in the assemblies, because in the apostle’s opinion that does not beseem them at any time. The reason why not, is given in the verses that follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is to be observed, further, that <a href="/1_timothy/2-12.htm" title="But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.">1 Timothy 2:12</a> corresponds exactly with <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.">1 Timothy 2:11</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΥΝῊ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΓΥΝΑΙΚΊ</span>; <span class="greekheb">ΜΑΝΘΑΝΈΤΩ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΔΙΔΆΣΚΕΙΝ ΟὐΚ ἘΠΙΤΡΈΠΩ</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἘΝ ΠΆΣῌ ὙΠΟΤΑΓῇ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΔῈ ΑὐΘΕΝΤΕῖΝ ΤΟῦ ἈΝΔΡ</span>.; <span class="greekheb">ἘΝ ἩΣΥΧΊᾼ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛʼ ΕἾΝΑΙ ἘΝ ἩΣΥΧΊᾼ</span></span></span>.

Still <a href="/1_timothy/2-12.htm" title="But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.">1 Timothy 2:12</a> is not therefore superfluous, since it both emphasizes and more precisely defines the particular ideas in <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.">1 Timothy 2:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ ΕἾΝΑΙ ἘΝ ἩΣΥΧΊᾼ</span></span></span>] The same construction is found in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>. The infinitive is dependent on a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΟΎΛΟΜΑΙ</span></span></span> to be supplied from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἘΠΙΤΡΈΠΩ</span></span></span>—an abbreviated construction which occurs also in classic Greek.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>De Wette rightly directs attention to these points, that we must not by arbitrary interpretations take away the clear definite meaning from the commands here laid down, in order to make them universal in application; and, on the other hand, that they are not to be considered as local and temporal ordinances: they are rather injunctions to be still held valid as applying to public assemblies.[106]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[104] Otto quotes the agreement of these passages with one another as a proof that the letters are contemporaneous. It is, however, to be observed that Paul himself, in the words: <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τῶς ἁγίων</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-33.htm" title="Why, my brothers, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another.">1 Corinthians 11:33</a>), describes the maxim as one which he was seeking to establish in all the churches. Hence there is nothing strange in his urging it on Timothy’s attention at a later period, just as he had urged it before on the Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[105] Hofmann, in opposition to these two views, maintains that the apostle here speaks of the “Christian life in general,” “of all action for which there was occasion in ordinary life;” but the context gives no ground for his assertion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[106] Compare with this apostolic expression, <span class="ital">Const. Apost.</span> iii. 6 : <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐπιτρέπομεν γυναῖκας διδάσκειν ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μόνον προσεύχεσθαι καὶ τῶν διδασκάλων ἐπακούειν</span>.

But, on the one hand, <span class="greekheb">προσεύχεσθαι</span> in the <span class="ital">Constitutions</span> does not mean exactly prayer <span class="ital">aloud</span>; and, on the other hand, this passage here does not plainly and directly forbid <span class="greekheb">προσεύχεσθαι</span> to women; it only forbids distinctly <span class="greekheb">διδάσκειν</span> on their part.—There is the same apparent contradiction between <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-34.htm" title="Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law....">1 Corinthians 14:34-35</a>, and <a href="/1_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered?">1 Corinthians 11:13</a>.
