The detailed injunctions <span class= "ital">how</span> the charge was to be carried out are introduced by the Greek particle <span class= "ital">oun, </span>translated in our version by “therefore;” it may be paraphrased thus: “In pursuance of my great charge, I proceed by special details; in the first place, let prayers <span class= "ital">for all</span> be offered by the congregation.”<p><span class= "bld">Supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks.</span>—Many attempts, some of them not very happy ones, have been made by grammarians and commentators to distinguish between these terms, each of which denotes prayer. On the whole, it may be assumed that the Greek word translated “supplications” signifies a request for particular benefits, and is a special form of the more general word rendered “prayers.” The third expression in the English version translated “intercessions” suggests a closer and more intimate communion with God on the part of the one praying. It speaks of drawing near God, of entering into free, familiar speech with Him. The Greek word suggests prayer in its most individual, urgent form. The fourth term, “giving of thanks,” expresses that which ought never to be absent from any of our devotions, gratitude for past mercies. Archbishop Trench remarks how this peculiar form of prayer will subsist in heaven when, in the very nature of things, all other forms of prayer will have ceased in the entire fruition of the things prayed for, for then only will the redeemed know how much they owe to their Lord. The word <span class= "ital">eucharist</span> is derived from the Greek word used in this place—<span class= "ital">eucharistia</span>—for in the Holy Communion the Church embodies its highest act of thanksgiving for the highest benefits received.<p><span class= "bld">For all men.</span>—Professor Reynolds well comments on the hardness of the task set us here—“It is difficult for us always to love all men, to think of all men as equally dear to God, or to regard all men as equally capable of being blessed. Timothy, after reading this letter, probably walked along the marble colonnade of the great temple of Artemis, or heard the hum of some twenty thousand Asiatic Greeks crowded in the vast theatre to witness the gladiatorial fight, or encountered a procession of Bacchantes, or turned into the synagogue on the side of the Coresias and saw the averted looks, and felt the bitter hatred of some old friends. We, with some knowledge of the modern world, have to look into the ‘hells’ upon earth; to survey the gold-fields and battle-fields; the African slave-hunts; the throngs and saloons of Pekin, Calcutta, and Paris; the monasteries of Tibet; and make prayers, petitions, intercessions, and thanksgivings, too, on behalf of all men. In the beginning of the Gospel, Timothy received this quiet injunction from the Apostle Paul. Now the once whispered word peals like the voice of many waters and mighty thunderings over the whole Church of God.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">I exhort therefore </span>— Seeing God is so gracious, and thou art intrusted with the office of the ministry, I give thee this in charge among other things. He proceeds to give directions, 1st, With regard to public prayers; and, 2d, With regard to doctrine. That <span class="ital">supplications </span>— To prevent evil; <span class="ital">prayers </span>— To procure good; <span class="ital">intercessions </span>— On behalf of others; <span class="ital">and giving of thanks </span>— For mercies received; <span class="ital">be made for all men</span> — Chiefly in public. <span class="ital">“Supplications, </span><span class="greekheb">δεησεις</span>,” says Whitby, “are deprecations for the pardon of sin, and averting divine judgments; <span class="greekheb">προσευχαι</span>, <span class="ital">prayers, </span>for the obtaining of all spiritual and temporal blessings; <span class="greekheb">εντευξεις</span>, <span class="ital">intercessions, </span>addresses presented to God for the salvation of others. And by this rule were the devotions of the church continually directed. For, saith the author of the book <span class="ital">De Vocatione Gentium, </span>‘there is no part of the world in which the Christian people do not put up such prayers as these, praying not only for the saints, but for infidels, idolaters, the enemies of the cross, and the persecutors of Christ’s members; for Jews, heretics, and schismatics.’” Of <span class="ital">prayer </span>in general we may observe, it is any kind of offering up of our desires to God. But the true, effectual, fervent prayer, which St. James speaks of as availing much, implies the vehemency of holy zeal, the ardour of divine love, arising from a calm, undisturbed soul, moved upon by the Spirit of God. “By this exhortation,” says Macknight, “we are taught, while men live, not to despair of their conversion, however wicked they may be, but to use the means necessary thereto, and to beg of God to accompany these means with his blessing.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The disciples of Christ must be praying people; all, without distinction of nation, sect, rank, or party. Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I exhort, therefore - Margin, "desire." The word exhort, however, better expresses the sense of the original. The exhortation here is not addressed particularly to Timothy, but relates to all who were called to lead in public prayer; <a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>. This exhortation, it may be observed, is inconsistent with the supposition that a liturgy was then in use, or with the supposition that there ever would be a liturgy - since, in that case, the objects to be prayed for would be prescribed. How singular would it be now for an Episcopal bishop to "exhort" his presbyters to pray "for the President of the United States and for all who are in authority." When the prayer is prescribed, do they not do this as a matter of course?<p>First of all - That is, as the first duty to be enjoined; the thing that is to be regarded with primary concern; compare <a href="/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a>. It does not mean that this was to be the first thing in public worship in the order of time, but that it was to be regarded as a duty of primary importance. The duty of praying for the salvation of the whole world was not to be regarded as a subordinate and secondary thing.<p>Supplications - It is not entirely easy to mark the difference in the meaning of the words used here, and it is not essential. They all relate to prayer, and refer only to the different parts of prayer, or to distinct classes of thought and desire which come before the mind in pleading for others. On the difference between the words supplications and prayers, see notes on <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>.<p>Intercessions - The noun used occurs only in this place and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>, of this Epistle. The verb, however &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  entungchano&#772;, occurs in <a href="/acts/25-4.htm">Acts 25:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>, <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>. See the meaning explained in the  <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a> note; <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a> note. There is one great Intercessor between God and man, who pleads for our salvation on the ground of what he himself has done, but we are permitted to intercede for others, not on the ground of any merit which they or we possess, but on the ground of the merit of the great Advocate and Intercessor. It is an inestimable privilege to be permitted to plead for the salvation of our fellow-men.<p>Giving of thanks - That is, in behalf of others. We ought to give thanks for the mercy of God to ourselves; it is right and proper also that we should give thanks for the goodness of God to others. We should render praise that there is a way of salvation provided; that no one is excluded from the offer of mercy; and that God is using so many means to call lost sinners to himself.<p>For all men - Prayers should be made for all people - for all need the grace and mercy of God; thanks should be rendered for all, for all may be saved. Does not this direction imply that Christ died for all mankind? How could we give thanks in their behalf if there were no mercy for them, and no way had been provided by which they could be saved? It may be observed here, that the direction to pray and to give thanks for all people, showed the large and catholic nature of Christianity. It was opposed entirely to the narrow and bigoted feelings of the Jews, who regarded the whole Gentile world as excluded from covenant mercies, and as having no offer of life. Christianity threw down all these barriers, and all people are on a level; and since Christ has died for all, there is ample ground for thanksgiving and praise in behalf of the whole human race.<p>See Supplementary note, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>1Ti 2:1-15.

Hence Paul, in opposition, gives prominence to the injunction that prayer be made for all men, especially for magistrates and kings (Tit 3:1-3) [Olshausen]. Some professing Christians looked down on all not Christians, as doomed to perdition; but Paul says all men are to be prayed for, as Christ died for all (1Ti 2:4-6).<p>supplications&#8212;a term implying the suppliant's sense of need, and of his own insufficiency.<p>prayers&#8212;implying devotion.<p>intercessions&#8212;properly the coming near to God with childlike confidence, generally in behalf of another.

The two principal parts of public worship, being the ministry of the word and prayer; and the apostle having insisted on the former, in the preceding chapter, in which he orders Timothy to charge some that they teach no other doctrine than that of the Gospel, gives an account of his own ministry, and call to it, and of the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to his trust, and stirs up Timothy to the faithful and diligent discharge of his work and office; now proceeds to the latter, to prayer, and exhorts unto it; either Timothy in particular, for so read the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, "I exhort thee", or "desire thee"; or else the church in general; unless it should rather be thought to be a charge to Timothy to exhort, and so Beza's Claromontane copy reads, "exhort thou therefore": but it is commonly considered as an exhortation of the apostle's, which he was very urgent in: it was what lay much upon his mind, and he was greatly desirous that it should be attended unto; for so the words may be read, "I exhort first of all", or before all things; of all things he had to say, this was the chief, or it was what he would have principally and chiefly done by others: for this does not so much regard the order of time, that prayer should be made early in the morning, in the first place, before anything else is done, and particularly before preaching, which seems to have been the custom of the primitive saints, <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a> but the pre-eminence and superior excellency of it; though the words may be rendered, "I exhort, that first, the supplications of all be made": and so may regard public prayer, the prayer of the whole church, in distinction from private prayer, or the prayer of a single person; which is expressed by different words, <p>supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks: the first of these, "supplications", signifies such petitions for things that are wanted by men, either by themselves or others; and that either for their bodies or souls, as food and raiment for the one, and discoveries of pardoning love, supplies of grace, spiritual peace, comfort, &amp;c. for the other: and the second word, "prayers", signifies good wishes and desires, directed and expressed to God for things that are in themselves to be wished for, and desired of God, either for ourselves or others: and the next word, "intercessions", intends either complaints exhibited in prayer against others that have done injuries; or prayers put up for others, either for the averting of evil from them, or for the bestowing some good thing on them: and the last word, "thanksgivings", with which requests should always be made known to God, designs that branch of prayer in which thanks are given to God for mercies received, whether temporal or spiritual: and these are to <p>be made for all men; not only for all the saints, for all the churches of Christ, and, ministers of the Gospel; nor only for near relations and friends, according to the flesh; but for all the inhabitants of the country and city in which men dwell, the peace and prosperity of which are to be prayed for; yea, for enemies, and such as reproach, persecute, and despitefully use the saints, even for all sorts of men, Jews and Gentiles, rich and poor, high and low, bond and free, good men and bad men: for it cannot be understood of every individual that has been, is, or shall be in the world; millions of men are dead and gone, for whom prayer is not to be made; many in hell, to whom it would be of no service; and many in heaven, who stand in no need of it; nor is prayer to be made for such who have sinned the sin unto death, <a href="/1_john/5-16.htm">1 John 5:16</a> besides, giving of thanks, as well as prayers, are to be made for all men; but certainly the meaning is not, that thanks should be given for wicked men, for persecutors, and particularly for a persecuting Nero, or for heretics, and false teachers, such as Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom the apostle had delivered to Satan. But the words must be understood of men of all sorts, of every rank and quality, as the following verse shows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <i>and</i> giving of thanks, be made for all men;</span><p>(1) Having dispatched those things which pertain to doctrine, he speaks now in the second place of the other part of the ministry of the word, that is, of public prayers.

Not less general in meaning is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΝΤΕΥΞΙς</span></span></span>, from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΤΥΓΧΆΝΕΙΝ ΤΙΝΊ</span></span></span> incidere in aliquem, adire aliquem, and in reference to God: <span class="ital">pray</span> (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-21.htm" title="Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,">Wis 8:21</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/16-28.htm" title="That it might be known, that we must prevent the sun to give thee thanks, and at the dayspring pray unto thee.">Wis 16:28</a>). The reference to another is not contained in the word itself, but in the preposition connected with it, as in <a href="/romans/11-2.htm" title="God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture said of Elias? how he makes intercession to God against Israel saying,">Romans 11:2</a> : <span class="greekheb">κατά τινος</span>; and <a href="/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΈΡ ΤΙΝΟς</span></span></span>. Accordingly, the substantive <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΝΤΕΥΞΙς</span></span></span>, which occurs only here and in chap. <a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm" title="For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.">1 Timothy 4:5</a>, does not in itself possess the meaning of intercession for others, but denotes simply prayer as an address to God (Wiesinger); comp. Plutarch, <span class="ital">Vita Numae</span>, chap. 14: <span class="greekheb">μὴ ποιεῖσθαι τὰς πρὸς τὸ θεῖον ἐντεύξεις ἐν ἀσχολίᾳ καὶ παρέργως</span>. The three words, accordingly, are thus distinguished: in the first, the element of insufficiency is prominent; in the second, that of devotion; and in the third, that of child-like confidence (prayer—the heart’s converse with God). Calvin is right in his remark, that Paul joined these three words together here “ut precandi studium et assiduitatem magis commendet ac vehementius urgeat.”[83]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστίας</span>] “prayers of thanksgiving,” the apostle adds, because in Christian prayer the giving of thanks should never be wanting; comp. <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Php 4:6</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν παντὶ τῇ προσευχῇ καὶ τῇ δεήσει μετὰ εὐχαριστίας τὰ αἰτήματα ὑμῶν γνωρίζεσθαι πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ πάντων ἀνθρώπων</span>] is not to be referred merely to <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστία</span>, but also to the preceding words (Wiesinger). The prayer of the Christian community (for this and not private prayer is here spoken of) is—in petition and thanksgiving—to embrace all mankind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[82] Hofmann’s reference of <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> to <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a> and the conclusion of ver. 16 is far-fetched: “If Christ came into the world to save sinners, and if the long-suffering of God towards the man whom He made His apostle from being a reviler, was to be a prophecy regarding the conversion of those who were afterwards made to believe on Him, it becomes Christians not, in sectarian fashion, to limit its command to its sphere at that time, but to extend it to all men.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[83] In regard to the more precise definition of the word, there is much that is arbitrary in expositors older and more recent. Thus <span class="greekheb">δέησις</span> is understood to be prayer for averting the punishment of sin; <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span>, prayer for the bestowal of benefits; <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις</span>, prayer for the punishment of the unrighteous (Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">δέησίς ἐστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἀπαλλαγῆς τινῶν λυπηρῶν ἱκετεία προσφερομένη</span>· <span class="greekheb">προσευχή ἐστιν αἴτησις ἀγαθῶν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἔντευξίς ἐστι κατηγορία τῶν ἀδικούντων</span>; so, too, Theophylact and Oecumenius). Photius (<span class="ital">ad Amphil.</span> qu. 193) explains <span class="greekheb">ἐντυχία</span> in the same way: <span class="greekheb">ἐντυχία</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὅταν τὶς κατὰ τῶν ἀδικούτων ἐντυγχάνῃ τῷ Θεῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">προσκαλούμενος αὐτὸν εἰς ἐκδίκησιν</span>); but the other two words differently: <span class="greekheb">δέησις μὲν λέγεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅταν τὶς Θεὸν ἀξεοῖ εἰς πρᾶγμα</span>· <span class="greekheb">προσευχὴ δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅταν ὑμνῇ τὸν Θεόν</span>. Origen (<span class="greekheb">περὶ εὐχῆς</span>, § 44) finds a climax in the succession of the words, and distinguishes <span class="greekheb">προσευχαί</span> from <span class="greekheb">δεήσεις</span> in this way, that the former are prayers joined with a <span class="greekheb">δοξολογία</span>, made for greater things and <span class="greekheb">μεγαλοφυέστερον</span>, while <span class="greekheb">ἐντεύξεις</span> are the prayers of one who has <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησίαν τινὰ πλείονα</span>.—Still more arbitrary is Kling’s explanation, that <span class="greekheb">δεήσεις</span> are prayers in reference to the circumstances of all mankind; <span class="greekheb">προσευχαί</span>, prayers for some benefit; <span class="greekheb">ἐντεύξεις</span>, prayers for the aversion of evil. Matthies is partly right, partly wrong when he says: <span class="greekheb">δέησις</span> is the prayer made with a feeling of the need of God, so that the inner side of the need <span class="ital">and of uprightness</span> (?) is particularly prominent; <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span>, prayer, in the act of devotional address to the Godhead, <span class="ital">therefore with reference to the outward exercise</span> (?); <span class="greekheb">ἐντεύξεις</span>, intercession, made not so much for ourselves as on behalf of others (?).—There is no ground whatever for the opinion of Heydenreich, that the first two expressions are used of prayer (<span class="greekheb">δέησις</span> = petition; <span class="greekheb">προσευχή</span> = thanksgiving) for the whole Christian community, while the other two (<span class="greekheb">ἔντευξις</span> = petition; <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστία</span> = thanksgiving) are used of prayer for the whole of mankind. Lastly, we may note the peculiar view of Augustine (<span class="ital">Ep.</span> 59), according to which the four expressions are to be understood of prayers used at the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, <span class="greekheb">δεήσεις</span> being the <span class="ital">precationes</span> before consecration; <span class="greekheb">προσευχαί</span>, the <span class="ital">orationes</span> at the benediction, consecration, and breaking of bread; <span class="greekheb">ἐντεύξεις</span>, the <span class="ital">interpellationes</span> at the benediction of the congregation; and <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστία</span>, the <span class="ital">gratiarum actio</span> at the close of the communion. Plitt so far agrees with this view of Augustine, that he thinks the apostle’s various expressions denote the various liturgical prayers, as they were defined even in ancient times at the celebration of the Eucharist (?).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;...">1 Timothy 2:1-7</a>. In the first place, let me remind you that the Church’s public prayers must be made expressly for all men, from the Emperor downwards. This care for all becomes those who know that they are children of a Father who wishes the best for all His children. He is one and the same to all, and the salvation He has provided in the Atonement is available for all. My own work among the Gentiles is one instance of God’s fetching home again His banished ones.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_timothy/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1–7</span>. Directions for Common Prayer and Intercession for all, since the Gospel is for all<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">I exhort therefore that, first of all</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">I exhort therefore first of all</span>; as my first special injunction after my general charge and commission, ch. 1 <span class="ital">1Tim 1:</span>3–5, 18, 19; the verb itself partly suggests the taking up of the subject in new form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that … supplications … be made</span>] The position of the Greek verb suggests its being middle voice rather than passive. So R.V. margin and Alford following Chrysostom: ‘I exhort to make supplications.’ The present tense implies the habitual making; and the absence of a subject leaves it unemphatic. In a modern rendering it might run exactly “I recommend therefore first of all the practice of common supplication and prayer, of common intercession and thanksgiving, in behalf of all men.” The middle is found in 17 places at least in N. T., in two of these governing the same word ‘supplications,’ <a href="/luke/5-33.htm" title="And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but your eat and drink?">Luke 5:33</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-4.htm" title="Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,">Php 1:4</a>. So Chrysostom in his comment here uses as the natural phrase ‘for all the world … we make our supplication.’ The only place where the passive occurs is in the perfect participle, <a href="/hebrews/12-27.htm" title="And this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.">Hebrews 12:27</a>, ‘as of things that have been made.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">supplications, prayers, intercessions</span>] In the first word there is, from its derivation, the idea of a felt ‘want’ and petition for its supply; cf. esp. <a href="/philippians/1-4.htm" title="Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,">Php 1:4</a>; <a href="/luke/1-13.htm" title="But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elisabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.">Luke 1:13</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2 Timothy 1:3</a>. Notice how in English, in the prayer of St Chrysostom, ‘our common supplications’ is explained by “requests” and by “desires and petitions.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the second, the idea of vow and ‘worship towards’ God, cf. <a href="/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.">Matthew 21:13</a>, ‘<span class="ital">my house</span> shall be called the house <span class="ital">of prayer</span>,’ <a href="/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>, ‘they continued stedfastly … in the breaking of bread and the prayers.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the third, the idea of a personal interview and solicitation, such as Abraham’s for Sodom: either (1) against, or (2) for some one: for (1) cf. <a href="/acts/25-24.htm" title="And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.">Acts 25:24</a>, ‘made suit to me, crying that he ought not to live,’ <a href="/romans/11-2.htm" title="God has not cast away his people which he foreknew.

Augustine says that the four words refer to the liturgical form of administration of Holy Communion: we may certainly say the converse that our ‘Divine Liturgy’ is modelled on this authorised rule, taking e.g. the modern ‘Prayer for the Church Militant’ with its express embodiment of this passage, or the ancient Gloria in Excelsis—(1) “In earth peace, goodwill towards men: (2) we bless thee, we worship Thee, O Lord, (3) Thou that takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us; (4) we give thanks to Thee, God the Father Almighty”: or taking the service as a whole, we get (1) the <span class="ital">supplication</span> for mercy and grace in the Kyrie after each Commandment, in the collects for the Queen and that for the day and the Church Militant, (2) the <span class="ital">prayer of worship</span> in the prayers of humble access and consecration, (3) the intercession in the Lord’s Prayer and following prayers, (4) the thanksgiving of the Gloria in Excelsis summarising all before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παρακαλῶ</span>, <span class="ital">I exhort</span>) In this chapter he describes public worship: I.

The question naturally arises whether the first words here used - <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - have any distinctive meaning, or are merely accumulated, like synonyms m legal documents, or various phrases in rhetorical addresses, to ensure completeness and to add force. It is against the notion of any distinctive meaning attaching to them that no such distinction can be supported by actual use. In <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a> two of the words (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are used in conjunction as here with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, with no apparent difference, both being the way of making known their requests to God (so also <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a>). Again, in the ancient Liturgies, the words <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are constantly used of the same praying. It may, however, perhaps be said that every <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, though every <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is not a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a "petition" - a distinct asking something of God, which a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> need not necessarily be. It may be merely an act of adoration, of confession, of recital of God's mercies, and so on. So as regards <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, here rendered "intercessions." There is nothing in the etymology/ or in the use of this word, which only occurs elsewhere in the New Testament in <a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>, to limit the meaning of it to "intercession." Nor has it this meaning in the passage where it occurs in the Liturgy of St. Clement, near the close, where God is addressed as <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "Who understandest the petitions even of those who are silent." In 2 Macc. 4:8 and Diod. Sic., 16:55 it seems to mean "a request preferred in a personal interview," which is an extension of its common meaning in classical Greek of "access," "an interview," "social intercourse," or the like. But when we turn to the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> in the New Testament, we seem to get the idea of "intercession."  <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is to go to someone to ask him to take action <span class="accented">against</span> or <span class="accented">in favor of</span> some third party (see <a href="/acts/25-24.htm">Acts 25:24</a>; <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27, 28, 34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>); and so Chrysostom (quoted in Steph., 'Thesaur.') explains <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to be the action of one who applies to God to avenge him of those who have done him wrong. So that perhaps "intercessions" is, on the whole, the best rendering here, though an imperfect one; and would comprise the prayers for the emperor, for the Church, for the sick, travelers, slaves, captives, etc., for the bishops, clergy, and laity, etc., and such prayers as "Turn away from us every plot (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) of wicked men" (Liturgy of St. Mark). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I exhort (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;)<p>See on consolation, <a href="/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24</a>.<p>First of all (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Connect with I exhort.

The two are associated, <a href="/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a> : the inverse order, <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>.<p>Intercessions (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here and <a href="/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>. lxx, 2 Macc. 4:8. The verb &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, commonly rendered to make intercession, <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>, <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>; and &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to intercede in behalf of, <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>. The verb signifies to fall in with a person; to draw near so as to converse familiarly. Hence, &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is not properly intercession in the accepted sense of that term, but rather approach to God in free and familiar prayer. &#x395;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; in the passages cited is not to make intercession, but to intervene, interfere. Thus in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>, it is not that the Spirit pleads in our behalf, but that he throws himself into our case; takes part in it. So <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a> : not that Jesus is ever interceding for us, but that he is eternally meeting us at every point, and intervening in al our affairs for our benefit. In &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; here the idea of interposition is prominent: making prayers a factor in relations with secular rulers. </body></html>
