The order clearly sprang out of the needs of the rapidly increasing church. Some two years after the Ascension (A.D. 34-35) the seven deacons were appointed to assist the Apostles as almoners of the brethren; as the Church’s life developed, the functions of these primitive subordinate ecclesiastical officers were enlarged. The history of the career of Stephen and Philip supply ample evidence of this. Out of his first apostolic appointment in the year 34-35, no doubt, was developed that great inferior order in the Church, respecting which these definite rules and authoritative regulations were laid down by the Apostle Paul in his instructions to Timothy in the matter of church government and order. These primitive deacons were evidently assistants to and probably in many cases supplied the place of the presbyters. The great similarity of the directions of St. Paul respecting the qualifications to be looked for in both, implies this; still their original employment as administrators of the Church’s funds and distribution of her alms remained to them. We can trace the existence of the order through and beyond the Apostle’s time:—<p>Jerusalem<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>34-35.<p>Original foundation of order by the Apostles at Jerusalem. <a href="/context/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1-6</a>.<p>Corinth<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>55.<p><a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>.<p>Rome<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>58-9.<p><a href="/romans/12-7.htm" title="Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;">Romans 12:7</a>.<p>Philippi<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>63.<p><a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>.<p>Ephesus<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>66.<p><a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-13.htm" title="For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.">1Timothy 3:13</a>.<p>Asia Minor<p>. . .<p>A.D.<p>63-69<p><a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

Amen.">1Peter 4:11</a>).<p>Thus in the first half of the second century we find the order regularly and apparently universally established, constituting an acknowledged part of the Christian system of ecclesiastical government. The scattered notices of the diaconate in the New Testament, dating almost from the Ascension—over a period exceeding thirty years—show us how, out of the needs of the Church, arose this subordinate order, which was rapidly developed as the Catholic Church increased. The differences between the deacon of the Pastoral Epistles, and the deacon of the writings of Justin Martyr, are exactly what we should expect would result from the seventy years of gradual but progressive organisation under men like St. John and his disciples and the immediate successors of the Apostles.<p><span class= "bld">Be grave.</span>—St. Paul again repeats the need for this feature of character being found in the lower order of ecclesiastical officers. The reverent decorum, the quiet gravity, which never interferes with the innocent, childlike happiness (see Note on <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;">1Timothy 3:4</a>), is especially to be looked for in a deacon, who ought to show an example of every-day Christian life.<p><span class= "bld">Not doubletongued.</span>—Bengel well paraphrases it, <span class= "ital">ad alios alia loquentes.</span> The deacon would have in his duties connected with the administration of the Church’s alms, and also in his more directly spiritual work, much opportunity of meeting with and talking to the various families of the flock of his Master. He must be watchful, in these visits, of his words, not suiting them to the occasion, and then unsaying in one house what he had affirmed in another. Such a grave fault—not an uncommon one—would, in the long run, deeply injure his influence abroad, and would inflict a deadly wound on his own spiritual life.<p><span class= "bld">Not given to much wine.</span>—The professed minister—the advocate for the cause of the poor and needy—must show an example of the strictest sobriety, must be pointed at as one caring little for the pleasures of the table. How well and nobly the young lieutenant of St. Paul aimed at showing in himself a self-denying example to the flock, we see from <a href="/1_timothy/5-23.htm" title="Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.">1Timothy 5:23</a>, when the old master deemed it requisite to warn his earnest, brave disciple from an asceticism which was positively weakening his power of work and endurance.<p><span class= "bld">Not greedy of filthy lucre.</span>—Those entrusted with the care of the Church’s alms surely must be especially careful of their reputation in the matter of covetousness—among the “chosen” of Timothy there must be no Judas.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;...">1 Timothy 3:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Likewise the deacons </span>— Of whom see on <a href="/context/acts/6-3.htm" title="Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business....">Acts 6:3-4</a>, and <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Php 1:1</a>; <span class="ital">must be grave — </span>Or <span class="ital">serious, </span>as some render <span class="greekheb">σεμνους</span>: men of a steady, decent, and venerable behaviour.

Although the apostle did not mention it, Timothy would readily infer from this direction concerning deacons, that it was equally necessary in bishops as in them to be sound in the faith, and holy in life. As <span class="ital">soundness in the faith </span>was required in deacons, it is probable they were sometimes, if not generally, employed in teaching; but whether by preaching or catechising is not certain. They likewise acted as readers in the congregations. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Likewise must the deacons - On the meaning of the word "deacons," see the notes on <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>. On their appointment, see the notes, <a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a>. The word here evidently denotes those who had charge of the temporal affairs of the church, the poor, etc. No qualifications are mentioned, implying that they were to be preachers of the gospel. In most respects, except in regard to preaching, their qualifications were to be the same as those of the "bishops."<p>Be grave - Serious, sober-minded men. In <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>, it is said that they should be men "of honest report." On the meaning of the word "grave," see the notes on <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>. They should be men who by their serious deportment will inspire respect.<p>Not double-tongued - The word here used &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  dilogos - does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It means, properly, uttering the same thing twice (from &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;  dis and &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;  lego&#772;), and then deceitful, or speaking one thing and meaning another. They should be men who can be relied on for the exact truth of what they say, and for the exact fulfillment of their promises.<p>Not given to much wine - see <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>. The word "much" is added here to what is said <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a> of the qualification of a bishop. It is not affirmed that it would be proper for the deacon, anymore than the bishop, to indulge in the use of wine in small quantities, but it "is" affirmed that a man who is much given to the use of wine ought not, on any consideration, to be a deacon. It may be remarked here, that this qualification was everywhere regarded as necessary for a minister of religion. Even the pagan priests, on entering a temple, did not drink wine. "Bloomfield." The use of wine, and of strong drinks of all kinds, was absolutely prohibited to the Jewish ministers of every rank when they were about to engage in the service of God; <a href="/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>. Why should it then be anymore proper for a Christian minister to drink wine than for a Jewish or a pagan priest? Shall a minister of the gospel be less holy than they? Shall he have a feebler sense of the purity of his vocation? Shall he be less careful lest he expose himself to the possibility of conducting the services of religion in an irreverent and silly manner? Shall he venture to approach the altar of God under the influence of intoxicating drinks, when a sense of propriety restrained the pagan priest, and a solemn statue of Yahweh restrained the Jewish priest from doing it?<p>Not greedy of filthy lucre - notes, <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>. The special reason why this qualification was important in the deacon was, that he would be entrusted with the funds of the church, and might be tempted to appropriate them to his own use instead of the charitable purposes for which they were designed; see this illustrated in the case of Judas, <a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. The deacons were chosen by the voice of the people. Cyprian [Epistle, 2.5] says that good bishops never departed from the old custom of consulting the people. The deacons answer to the chazzan of the synagogue: the attendant ministers, or subordinate coadjutors of the presbyter (as Timothy himself was to Paul, 1Ti 4:6; Phm 13; and John Mark, Ac 13:5). Their duty was to read the Scriptures in the Church, to instruct the catechumens in Christian truths, to assist the presbyters at the sacraments, to receive oblations, and to preach and instruct. As the "chazzan" covered and uncovered the ark in the synagogue, containing the law, so the deacon in the ancient Church put the covering on the communion table. (See Chrysostom [19], Homily on Acts; Theophylact on Luke 19; and Balsaman on Canon 22, Council of Laodicea). The appointing of "the seven" in Ac 6:1-7 is perhaps not meant to describe the first appointment of the deacons of the Church. At least the chazzan previously suggested the similar order of deacons.<p>double-tongued&#8212;literally, "of double speech"; saying one thing to this person, and another to that person [Theodoret]. The extensive personal intercourse that deacons would have with the members of the Church might prove a temptation to such a fault. Others explain it, "Saying one thing, thinking another" (Pr 20:19; Ga 2:13). I prefer the former.<p>not greedy of filthy lucre&#8212;All gain is filthy (literally, "base") which is set before a man as a by-end in his work for God [Alford] (1Pe 5:2). The deacon's office of collecting and distributing alms would render this a necessary qualification.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Likewise must the deacons be grave:</span> the term <span class="ital">deacon</span> signifies the same with one that ministereth, and is applicable to any that have any service in the church.

Indeed both Stephen and Philip did preach, but the latter was an evangelist, and it was a time of persecution, when even the more private brethren went every where preaching the gospel.

The apostle proceeds to give the qualifications, and so the rules for choosing another sort of officers in the church, deacons; whose work and business is, not to preach the Gospel, and administer ordinances; but to take care of the secular affairs of the church, and particularly to serve tables; to provide the bread and wine for the Lord's table, to attend at it, and distribute the elements from the minister to the people, to collect for it, defray the charges of it, and divide what remains among the poor; and they are to take care of the minister's table, that he is provided for in a comfortable way, and to stir up the members to their duty in this respect; and to take care of the poor's table, and distribute what the church collects for them, with simplicity and cheerfulness; and are to be helps to the pastor, in observing the walk of members, in composing differences between them, in visiting the sick and poor, and in preparing matters for church meetings. Their characters are, that they be "grave"; in their speech, gesture, and dress; honest, and of good report among men; and chaste in their words and actions; all which may be signified by the word here used; and the latter may be rather hinted at, because of Nicholas, one of the first deacons, who was charged with uncleanness: <p>not doubletongued; whose hearts and tongues do not agree together; and who, being a sort of middle persons between the pastor and the members of the church, say one thing to one, and another to the other; which to do is of bad consequence: or who speak well to the poor when they apply to them, and promise them to do them all the service they can, and when it comes to the upshot speak against them: <p>not given to much wine; which impairs the health, stupefies the mind, and so renders unfit for any such office, as well as wastes the temporal estate; and may lead them to embezzle and consume the church's stock: <p>not greedy of filthy lucre; for such would withhold from the poor that which is meet for them, and make use of money in their hands, to their own advantage. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Likewise <i>must</i> the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> deacons <i>be</i> grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</span><p>(3) Likewise the deacons must first be proved, that there may be a good trial of their honesty, truth, sobriety, mind void of covetousness, that they are well instructed in the doctrine of faith, and to be short, of their good conscience and integrity.<p>(e) These are those that had to look after the poor.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>.
