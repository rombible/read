The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men.

In the case of the deacons, as in that of the bishops, he mentions the first condition of receiving office, rather than the special qualifications for its discharge. The practical side of Christianity is the one most dwelt on in the Pastoral Epistles, in opposition to the heretical teachers; moreover, as the miraculous gifts began to be withdrawn, the safest criterion of efficiency would be the previous moral character of the candidate, the disposition and talent for the office being presupposed. So in Ac 6:3, a similar criterion was applied, "Look ye out among you seven men of honest report." Less stress is laid on personal dignity in the case of the deacon than in that of the bishop (compare Notes, see on [2472]1Ti 3:2,3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See the sense of these words, <span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>,4</span>, being the qualifications also of a bishop. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife,....
