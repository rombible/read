but, as Doddridge observes, it can by no means be concluded from hence that Paul wrote this epistle to Timothy after his imprisonment at Rome. <span class="ital">But if I tarry long </span>— If I am hindered from coming, I give thee these instructions in the mean time; <span class="ital">that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself </span>— That is, how to discharge thy office properly; (which is the scope of the whole epistle;) <span class="ital">in the house of God </span>— In which thou hast the honour to bear so high an office, even in that house, or family, <span class="ital">which is the church of the living God </span>— Where he is worshipped in spirit and in truth by his believing people, manifests his special presence, and bestows peculiar blessings. The tabernacle first, and afterward the temple, obtained the name of the house or habitation of God, because there the symbol of the divine presence resided, <a href="/1_samuel/1-7.htm" title="And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.">1 Samuel 1:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.">Matthew 21:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-38.htm" title="Behold, your house is left to you desolate.">Matthew 23:38</a>. But under the gospel dispensation no material building or temple is called the <span class="ital">house of God. </span>That appellation is given only to the church of God, or to those societies of men who profess to believe in Christ, and join together in worshipping God according to the gospel form. <span class="ital">The pillar and ground </span>— Or <span class="ital">support, </span>as <span class="greekheb">εδραιωμα </span>signifies; <span class="ital">of the truth </span>— That is, of the whole system of gospel truth. “Some commentators think Timothy is called, in this passage, <span class="ital">the pillar and support of the truth, </span>for the same reason that Peter, James, and John are called <span class="ital">pillars, </span>(<a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>,) and that the particle <span class="greekheb">ως</span>, as, should be supplied before these words, and the clause translated thus: <span class="ital">That thou mayest know how thou ought to behave thyself, as the pillar and support of the truth in the church, of the living God. </span>But, not to insist on the harshness and irregularity of this construction, it must be observed, that seeing the interpretation of the passage hath been much contested, a word, which entirely changes the apostle’s meaning, should by no means be inserted in the text on mere conjecture, because in that manner the Scriptures may be made to speak any thing which bold critics please.” — Macknight. According to the common reading, the church of God is evidently here called the pillar and support of truth. And since the apostle must be understood as speaking, not of any particular falsely pretended, fallen, or corrupt church, but of the true, genuine, catholic church, or, as he expresses himself, <span class="ital">the church of the living God, </span>consisting of all the true churches of Christ throughout the world, and comprehending all true believers and lovers of God, all who <span class="ital">hold the mystery of faith in a pure conscience; </span>(<a href="/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>;) this church, so constituted, may with perfect propriety be termed <span class="ital">the pillar and support of the truth, </span>as preserving, from age to age, the Holy Scriptures, which attest the truth, and as always believing and maintaining the great fundamental articles of the Christian faith. Bengelius, however, and many others, adopt a different reading, so far as to end the sentence with <span class="ital">the church of the living God, </span>and to begin the next with the words following, thus: <span class="ital">The mystery of godliness is the pillar and ground of truth, and confessedly a great thing. </span>And this reading is approved by Witsius, Whitby, Doddridge, Wesley, and many other eminent commentators. According to this interpretation, by the <span class="ital">mystery of godliness </span>we are to understand that wonderful and sublime doctrine which is revealed in the gospel, and immediately specified in six articles, which sum up the whole economy of Christ upon earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God was manifest in the flesh </span>— Namely, the Word that was in the beginning with God, and was God, was incarnated, (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>,) in the human nature of Jesus, conceived by a miracle in the womb of the virgin, and born of her, to whom, therefore, the divine names of <span class="ital">God, Lord, </span>and <span class="ital">Jehovah, </span>are repeatedly given in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments; as also the divine titles of <span class="ital">the true God, </span><a href="/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.

And to him, as we have very often seen in the course of these notes, divine worship was frequently paid by those divinely-inspired persons, who could not be mistaken, particularly in a matter so momentous.

The church holds forth the Scripture and the doctrine of Christ, as a pillar holds forth a proclamation. When a church ceases to be the pillar and ground of truth, we may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth should be first and greatest. The mystery of godliness is Christ. He is God, who was made flesh, and was manifest in the flesh. God was pleased to manifest himself to man, by his own Son taking the nature of man. Though reproached as a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, Christ was raised again by the Spirit, and so was justified from all the false charges with which he was loaded. Angels ministered to him, for he is the Lord of angels. The Gentiles welcomed the gospel which the Jews rejected. Let us remember that God was manifest in the flesh, to take away our sins, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These doctrines must be shown forth by the fruits of the Spirit in our lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly - That is, he hoped to come there to give instructions personally, or to finish, himself, the work which he had commenced in Ephesus, and which had been interrupted by his being driven so unexpectedly away. This verse proves that the apostle Paul did not regard Timothy as the permanent diocesan bishop of Ephesus. Would any Episcopal bishop write this to another bishop? If Timothy were the permanent prelate of Ephesus, would Paul have intimated that he expected soon to come and take the work of completing the arrangements there into his own hands?

T. p. 304]), though in the background, has not wholly disappeared: “sooner” (not “than the arrival of this letter,” or “than thou wilt have need of these instructions,” Winer) “than is or was to be expected.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In spite of this hope, the apostle’s arrival might possibly be longer delayed, and this possibility had induced him to impart his instructions by writing, lest Timothy should be without them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘᾺΝ ΔῈ ΒΡΑΔΎΝΩ</span></span></span> (the verb only here and at <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm" title="The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.">2 Peter 3:9</a>), <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ΕἸΔῇς Πῶς ΔΕῖ ἘΝ ΟἼΚῼ ΘΕΟῦ ἈΝΑΣΤΡΈΦΕΣΘΑΙ</span>] <span class="greekheb">Πῶς ΔΕῖ ἈΝΑΣΤΡΈΦΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> refers not so much to the Christian life in general, as to behaviour in church life, viz. in divine service and in church arrangements. This limitation is clearly indicated by the connection with what precedes, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑῦΤΑ</span></span></span> referring us back (in opposition to Hofmann). Its subject is either Timothy, in which case <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΈ</span></span></span> is to be supplied (Luther: “how thou shouldst walk;” so, too, Wiesinger), or no definite subject should be supplied: “how one should walk.”[137] Both explanations are possible in language and in fact; but the second may be preferred, because Paul in the preceding part (to which <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> refers) did not say what Timothy was to do, but what arrangements were to prevail in the church; Hofmann thinks differently, as he understands <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> of the whole epistle. The expression <span class="greekheb">οἶκος Θεοῦ</span> denotes properly the temple at Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21-13.htm" title="And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.">Matthew 21:13</a>), then also the O. T. people as the church in which God had His dwelling (<a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;">Hebrews 3:5</a>); in Christian usage it is the N. T. people in whom the dwelling of God has been fully realized; <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm" title="But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.">Hebrews 3:6</a> (<a href="/hebrews/10-21.htm" title="And having an high priest over the house of God;">Hebrews 10:21</a>); <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm" title="For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?">1 Peter 4:17</a>; synonymous with it are the expressions: <span class="greekheb">κατοικητήριον Θεοῦ</span>, <a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>; <span class="greekheb">ναὸς Θεοῦ</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To elucidate the symbolic expression, Paul adds: <span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ ζῶντος</span>] The pronoun <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> (= “seeing it”) makes the explanatory sentence emphatic, by indicating why there should be such behaviour in the house of God as Paul had prescribed (which Hofmann denies); and the reason is not simply that it is an <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> a church, and as such has necessarily certain definite ordinances, but still more definitely because it is a church of God, of the <span class="ital">living</span> God, who as such esteems highly His ordinances in His church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There follow in simple apposition the words: <span class="greekheb">στύλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα τῆς ἀληθείας</span>] These words are in apposition to <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία Θ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζ</span>., and as such are rightly explained by the older[138] and most of recent commentators (Luther, Melanchthon, Calvin, Beza, Mack, Matthies, de Wette, Wiesinger, Hofmann; now, too, by van Oosterzee, 3d ed.[139]). Some Protestant commentators, however, influenced by their polemic against the Catholic idea of the church, have taken these words as the beginning of the following sentence (first, in the edition of the N. T. at Basel, 1540, 1545; later, Bengel, Mosheim, Heydenreich, Matt; formerly also van Oosterzee). The reasons against this construction are—(1) That the new thought would be taken up in a very abrupt and sudden manner, while by connecting it with the previous words, the train of thought is suitable and natural; (2) That “grammatically the third defining term, simply adjectival, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὉΜΟΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΜΈΛΑ</span></span></span>, cannot well be placed in co-ordination with two predicates like <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΎΛΟς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΔΡΑΊΩΜΑ</span></span></span>” (Wiesinger, following Schleiermacher); and (3) That, whereas <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ Τῆς ΕὐΣΕΒΕΊΑς ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span> is nothing else than the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑ</span></span></span>, this construction would make the former designate the latter as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΎΛΟς ΚΑῚ ἙΔΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, which would clearly be unsuitable. There is manifestly nothing to be said for the opinion of some commentators,[140] that by <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑδρ</span>. we are to understand Timothy.[141]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΎΛΟς</span></span></span> in the figurative sense occurs only here and at <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm" title="Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.">Revelation 3:12</a>. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἾΚΟς ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> is called <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΤΎΛΟς Τῆς ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς</span></span></span>, inasmuch as the pillar supports and bears the roof resting on it (see Meyer on <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>), but not “inasmuch as it serves to elevate something and make it manifest” (Hofmann). The same idea is expressed by the second word: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΔΡΑΊΩΜΑ</span></span></span>, the base, foundation (similarly <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕΜΈΛΙΟς</span></span></span>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2 Timothy 2:19</a>), a word which is only used here in the N. T. The thought that the divine truth is supported and borne by the church, has nothing startling when we remember that the church, as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἾΚΟς ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, has the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of truth; the Spirit of truth, therefore, is its indwelling, all-penetrating principle of life, by which it stands in closest communion with its head.[142] But if the church is set up to be the preserver of divine truth, it is all the more important that all should be well-ordered in it. These words stand, therefore, in close connection with what precedes; but, at the same time, they make the transition to what follows, where the apostle in a few brief characteristics gives the nature of the truth, that he may from this point return to his polemic against the heretics, and continue it further.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[136] Hofmann’s assertion, that the reference of <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> to what precedes is forbidden by the present <span class="greekheb">γράφω</span> (for which we should have had <span class="greekheb">ἔγραφα</span>), is contradicted by <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-37.htm" title="If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.">1 Corinthians 14:37</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-20.htm" title="Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.">Galatians 1:20</a>; also by <a href="/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[137] The impersonal <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> is usually joined with the accusative and infinitive, the infinitive denoting the thing, the accusative the person who must do the action expressed by the verb. More frequently the person is not named, but is easily supplied from the context, as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> in <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>, where <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, in <a href="/luke/12-12.htm" title="For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.">Luke 12:12</a>, where again <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, and in <a href="/luke/15-32.htm" title="It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.">Luke 15:32</a>, where <span class="greekheb">σέ</span> is to be supplied. Hofmann is therefore wrong in asserting that there is no linguistic justification for supplying <span class="greekheb">σέ</span> here, where <span class="greekheb">εἰδῇς</span> precedes. Sometimes, however, <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> refers to no particular person; so <a href="/john/4-20.htm" title="Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.">John 4:20</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὅπου προσκυνεῖν δεῖ</span>; <a href="/acts/5-29.htm" title="Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.">Acts 5:29</a> : <span class="greekheb">πειθαρχεῖν δεῖ Θεῷ</span>; <a href="/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">δεῖ περιτέμνειν αὐτούς</span>; <a href="/titus/1-11.htm" title="Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.">Titus 1:11</a> : <span class="greekheb">οὓς δεῖ ἐπιστομέζειν</span>; the <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> in that case corresponds to the English “one must.” It is arbitrary, with Hofmann, to supply <span class="greekheb">τινά</span> here, and understand by it one who “has to govern a house of God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[138] Theodore of M. rightly says: <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησίας οὐ τοὺς οἴκους λέγει τοὺς εὐκτηρίους κατὰ τὴν τῶν πολλῶν συνήθειαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ τῶν πιστῶν τὸν σύλλογον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅθεν καὶ στύλον αὐτὴν καὶ ἑδραίωμα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκάλεσεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἂν ἐν αὐτῇ τῆς ἀληθείας τὴν σύστασιν ἐχούσης</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[139] Van Oosterzee is, however, inclined to conjecture that “there is here a corruption of the text which cannot now be restored with certainty.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[140] Gregory of Nyssa (<span class="ital">de Vita Mosis</span>): <span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον Πέτρος καὶ Ἰάκωβος καὶ Ἰωάννης στῦλοι τῆς ἐκκλησίας εἰσι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεῖος ἀπόστολος καὶ τὸν Τιμόθεον στύλον καλὸν ἐτεκτήνατο</span>, <span class="greekheb">ποιήσας αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καθὼς φησὶ τῇ ἰδίᾳ φωνῇ</span>, <span class="greekheb">στύλον καὶ ἑδραίωμα τῆς ἐκκλησίας</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[141] Though Chrysostom construes rightly, he yet inverts the meaning of the sentence: <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὡς ἐκεῖνος ὁ Ἰουδαικὸς οἶκος θ</span>., <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο γάρ ἐστι τὸ συνέχον τὴν πίστιν καὶ τὸ κήρυγμα</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἡ γὰρ ἀλήθειά ἐστι τῆς ἐκκλησίας καὶ στύλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[142] Wiesinger rightly calls attention to the distinction which should be made between “the truth as it is in itself, and the truth as it is acknowledged in the world,” and then says: “in the former respect it needs no support, but bears itself; in the latter, it needs the church as its support, as its bearer and preserver.” If the Catholic Church has drawn wrong conclusions from the apostle’s words, it has itself to blame, and not the apostle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_timothy/3-14.htm" title="These things write I to you, hoping to come to you shortly:...">1 Timothy 3:14-16</a>.
