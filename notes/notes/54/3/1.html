The “faithful saying” here refers to the wish for high and arduous work in the Church of Christ, and declares such a wish to be a noble one; for the office in question was a beautiful one, and honourable, and in those days meant stern and ceaseless work, grave and constant danger. It was no doubt one of the well-known sayings among the brethren of the first days, and not improbably, with the other “faithful sayings” of this group of Epistles, formed a part of their liturgy, and was woven into some of their special prayers offered in public. Perhaps this “faithful saying” was a portion of a prayer offered not unfrequently in the public assembly, asking that volunteers might be moved by the Holy Ghost to present themselves for the then dangerous office of ordained ministers of the Word.<p>“Well might a man desire the office of chief pastor; it was indeed a good work;” but, in the first place, such a dignity could only be held by one possessing many qualities, then and there enumerated.<p><span class= "bld">If a man desire the office of a bishop.</span>—More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">If a man seeketh.</span> In the . . Pastoral Epistles the Greek words rendered “bishop” and “presbyter” or elder (<span class= "ital">episcopos, presbuteros</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>are applied indifferently to the same person, for up to this period (A.D. 65-6) no necessity had arisen in the constitution of the Church for the appointment of a <span class= "ital">special order</span> of superintending presbyters. The numbers of the members of the brotherhood, though every year showing a vast increase, were still, comparatively speaking, small. St. Peter, St. Paul, St. James and St. John, and certainly the majority of the apostolic college, were still living; while, till A.D. 70, the Jerusalem congregation still acted as the central authority of the Church, and grave questions continued to be referred to the Fathers resident there.<p>Early in the second century, however, there is not a shadow of doubt that the episcopal office, as we understand it, was widely established. During the last thirty years, then, of the first century, this great change in Church organisation must have been effected—that is, <span class= "ital">during the life-time of St. John.</span> How this was brought about is admirably stated by Professor Rothe, of Heidelberg, as quoted by Canon Lightfoot in his dissertation on the Christian ministry (<span class= "ital">Commentary</span> <span class= "ital">on the Epistle to the Philippians</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>who, without accepting all the details suggested, still in the main agrees with the famous Heidelberg professor in his theory respecting the very early establishment of episcopacy in the Catholic Church. After painting the distractions and growing dissensions of the Church, occasioned by the jealousies between the Jewish and Gentile brethren, and the menacing apparition of the Gnostic heresy, Rothe states how, in the face of this great emergency, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. James were carried away by death almost at the same time; while, with the overthrow of Jerusalem very shortly after, the visible centre of the Church was removed, the keystone of the fabric was withdrawn, and the whole edifice was threatened with ruin. There was a crying need for some organisation which should cement together the diverse elements of Christian society, and preserve it from disintegration. Out of this need the Catholic Church in its episcopal character arose. From notices in Eusebius, Irenæus, and Clement of Rome, Rothe (quoted by Lightfoot) concludes “that, immediately after the fall of Jerusalem, a council of the surviving Apostles and first teachers of the gospel was held to deliberate on the crisis, and to frame measures for the well-being of the Church. The centre of the system thus organised was episcopacy, which at once secured the compact and harmonious working of each individual congregation, and, as the link of communication between the separate brotherhoods, formed the whole into one undivided Catholic Church. Recommended by this high authority, the new constitution was immediately and generally adopted.”<p><span class= "bld">He desireth a good work.</span>—The office of a presbyter of the Church in the days of St. Paul was a difficult and dangerous post. It involved much labour; it was full of risk; it meant a hard and severe life; yet, from the Christian’s standpoint, it was a work, if faithfully performed, of all toils the most beautiful, the most honourable, the most noble. “<span class= "ital">Negotium non otium</span>” comments Bengel, in his usual pithy, untranslatable way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1 Timothy 3:1</a></span>. Because some false teachers were now spreading their erroneous doctrines with assiduity among the believers at Ephesus, and it was necessary that Timothy (to whom the care of the church there was committed) should be assisted by some bishops, or elders, and deacons, well qualified to teach the people, the apostle, after observing what an honourable office that of a Christian bishop is, here describes the qualities and virtues necessary in one who desires to attain it. <span class="ital">This is a true saying</span> — Most certain in itself, and worthy of being always acknowledged and attended to; <span class="ital">if a man desire, </span>(or earnestly seek, as <span class="greekheb">ορεγεται </span>signifies,) <span class="ital">the office of a bishop </span>— Overseer, or <span class="ital">pastor </span>of Christ’s flock, frequently termed presbyters, or elders, in the New Testament.

A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is a trite saying - Greek, "Faithful is the word" - the very phrase which is used in <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; see the notes on that verse. The idea here is, that it was worthy of credence; it was not to be doubted.<p>If a man desire - Implying that there would be those who would wish to be put into the ministry. The Lord, undoubtedly, by his Spirit, often excites an earnest and irrepressible desire to preach the gospel - a desire so strong, that he in whom it exists can be satisfied in no other calling. In such a case, it should be regarded as one evidence of a call to this work. The apostle, however, by the statements which follow, intimates that wherever this desire exists, it is of the utmost importance to have just views of the nature of the office, and that there should be other qualifications for the ministry than a mere desire to preach the gospel. He proceeds, therefore, to state those qualifications, and no one who "desires" the office of the ministry should conclude that he is called to it, unless these qualifications substantially are found in him. The word rendered "desire" here (&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;  orego&#772;), denotes properly, "to reach" or "stretch out" - and hence to reach after anything, to long after, to try to obtain; <a href="/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>.<p>The office of a bishop - The Greek here is a single word - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;  episkope&#772;s. The word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;  episkope&#772; - "Episcope" - whence the word "Episcopal" is derived - occurs but four times in the New Testament. It is translated "visitation" in <a href="//biblehub.com/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>, and in <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>; "bishoprick," Acts . <a href="/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>; and in this place "office of a bishop." The verb from which it is derived (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  episkopeo&#772;), occurs but twice, In <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>, it is rendered "looking diligently," and in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>, "taking the oversight." The noun rendered bishop occurs in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>. The verb means, properly, to look upon, behold; to inspect, to look after, see to, take care of; and the noun denotes the office of overseeing, inspecting, or looking to. It is used to denote the care of the sick, Xeno. Oec. 15, 9; compare "Passow;" and is of so general a character that it may denote any office of overseeing, or attending to. There is nothing in the word itself which would limit it to any class or grade of the ministry, and it is, in fact, applied to nearly all the officers of the church in the New Testament, and, indeed, to Christians who did not sustain "any" office. Thus it is applied:<p>(a) to believers in general, directing them to "look diligently, lest anyone should fail of the grace of God," <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>;<p>(b) to the elders of the church at Ephesus, "over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers," <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>;<p>(c) to the elders or presbyters of the church in <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>, "Feed the flock of God, taking the oversight thereof;<p>(d) to the officers of the church in Philippi, mentioned in connection with deacons as the only officers of the church there, "to the saints at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons," <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>;<p>(e) to Judas, the apostate. <a href="/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>; and,<p>(f) to the great Head of the church, the Lord Jesus Christ, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>, "the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."<p>From this use of the term it follows:<p>(1) That the word is never used to designate the "uniqueness" of the apostolic office, or so as to have any special applicability to the apostles. Indeed, the term "bishop" is "never" applied to any of them in the New Testament; nor is the word in any of its forms ever used with reference to them, except in the single case of "Judas," <a href="/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>.<p>(2) it is never employed in the New Testament to designate an order of men superior to presbyters, regarded as having any other functions than presbyters, or being in any sense "successors" to the apostles. It is so used now by the advocates of prelacy; but this is a use wholly unknown to the New Testament. It is so undeniable that the name is never given in the New Testament to those who are now called "bishops," that even Episcopalians concede it. Thus, Dr. Onderdonk (Tract on Episcopacy, p. 12) says, "All that we read in the New Testament concerning 'bishops' is to be regarded as pertaining to the 'middle grade;' that is, to those who are now regarded as 'priests.'" This is not strictly correct, as is clear from the remarks above respecting what is called the "middle grade;" but it is strictly correct, so far as it affirms that it is "never" applied to prelates.<p>(3) it is used in the New Testament to denote ministers of the gospel who had the care or oversight of the churches, without any regard to grade or rank.<p>(4) it has now, as used by Episcopalians, a sense which is wholly unauthorized by the New Testament, and which, indeed, is entirely at variance with the usage there. To apply the term to a pretended superior order of clergy, as designating their special office, is wholly to depart from the use of the word as it occurs in the Bible.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>1Ti 3:1-16.

Some think this clause belongs to the last verse of the preceding chapter; and then the sense is, this is a doctrine that is true, and to be believed, that there is salvation through the birth of a Son, or through the incarnate Son of God, for men and women that believe in him, and continue in the faith of him, and love to him, joined with works of righteousness and holiness.

Though it regards what follows in <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a> and so it seems that it should be considered here; and is used to excite attention, and suggests that what was about to be said was of moment and importance, and what was without controversy, and unquestionably true. The apostle, having denied to women the work and office of teaching, proceeds to observe, that though this belonged to men, yet not to every man; and therefore he gives the qualifications of such; which might serve as a direction to churches, in the choice of them; as well as be a means of stirring up persons in such an office, to a proper regard to themselves and their work: <p>if a man desire the office of a bishop; which is the same with that of a pastor or elder; and so here the Syriac version renders it, "if a man desires presbytery, or eldership"; and it lies in preaching the word, administering the ordinances of the Gospel, and taking care of the discipline of the church, and in the visiting, inspection, and oversight of it; as the word  "episcopacy", here used, signifies; and this work and office may be lawfully and laudably desired, with a view to the glory of God, and the good of immortal souls.

He begins with the office of the episcopus, or presbyter, because that is of the very essence of Church order. On the question as to the terms presbyter and episcopus, it is sufficient here to state my own conclusion, that they represent slightly different aspects of the same office, pastoral and official; aspects which came naturally into prominence in the Jewish and Greek societies respectively which gave birth to the names. This seems the obvious conclusion from a comparison of <a href="/acts/20-17.htm" title="And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.">Acts 20:17</a>; <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Php 1:1</a>; <a href="/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a>; <a href="/titus/1-7.htm" title="For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;">Titus 1:7</a>; <a href="/context/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work....">1 Timothy 3:1-2</a>; <a href="/context/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;...">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:...">1 Peter 5:1-2</a>; Clem.

Field (in loc.) notes that “it has a special application to such objects as a man is commonly said to <span class="ital">aspire to</span>”. The sanity of St. Paul’s judgment is nowhere better seen than in his commendation of lawful ambition. A man may be actuated by a variety of motives; yet it is not inevitable that those that are lower should impair the quality of the higher; they need not interpenetrate each other. In any case, St. Paul credits the aspirant with the noblest ideal: <span class="ital">He who aspires to be an episcopus desires to perform a good work</span>, “<span class="ital">Esther opus; negotium, non otium</span>. <a href="/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Php 2:30</a>” (Bengel).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[263] <span class="ital">Speculum</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καλοῦ ἔργου</span>: <span class="greekheb">καλὸν ἔργον</span> and <span class="greekheb">καλὰ ἔργα</span> (see reff.) are not peculiar to the Pastorals (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-10.htm" title="When Jesus understood it, he said to them, Why trouble you the woman? for she has worked a good work on me.">Matthew 26:10</a> = <a href="/mark/14-6.htm" title="And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble you her? she has worked a good work on me.">Mark 14:6</a>; <a href="/context/john/10-32.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?...">John 10:32-33</a>); but, as the references show, the phrase is found in them only of the Pauline Epistles.

So A.V. and R.V., though the margin of R.V. mentions that ‘Some connect the words … with the preceding paragraph’; and Westcott and Hort in their text by the mode of printing so connect it. The early Greek Fathers are divided; Chrysostom, e.g. is for reference to the preceding, Theod. Mops, to the following, quoting our Lord’s ‘Verily, verily.’ The various reading of D <span class="ital">anthrôpinos</span> (some Latin Versions have <span class="ital">humanus</span>) ‘this is a <span class="ital">human</span> saying,’ read also in <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a>, cannot very well be explained as by Ellicott, an equivalent of <span class="ital">benignus</span>, for how could <span class="ital">benignus</span> at all fairly represent <span class="ital">pistos</span>, faithful, trusty? Nor can it have arisen from the spread of the <span class="ital">nolo episcopari</span> feeling, causing this place to give offence, so that ‘human,’ ‘carnal’ was substituted; for when substituted it turns the context upside down, and the explanation could not hold in <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a>.

It was not till the sub-apostolic age that the name of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1fbf;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was confined to the chief overseer who had "<span class="accented">priests</span> and deacons" under him, as Timothy and Titus had. Possibly this application of the word arose from the visits of the apostles, and afterwards of men sent by the apostles, as Timothy and Titus, Tychicus and <span class="accented">Artemas</span>, were, to visit the Churches, being occasional and temporary only, as those of Visitors. For such occasional visitation is implied in the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36, 43</a>; <a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68, 78</a>; <a href="/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>; <a href="/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Afterwards, when the wants of the Churches required permanent oversight, the name <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - <span class="accented">vescovo</span> (It.), <span class="accented">eueque</span> (Fr.), <span class="accented">bischof</span> (Get.), <span class="accented">bisceop</span> (A.S.), <span class="accented">aipiskaupus</span> (Moeso-Goth.), etc. - became universal for the chief overseer of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">A good work</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, as ver. 10). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> means "honourable," "becoming," "beneficial," and the like. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>This is a true saying (&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Better, faithful is the saying.

The word implies eagerness, but not of an immoderate or unchristian character.

The fundamental idea of the sword is overseeing. The term &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; was not furnished by the gospel tradition: it did not come from the Jewish synagogue, and it does not appear in Paul's lists of those whom God has set in the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). Its adoption came about in a natural way. Just as senatus, &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; passed into official designations through the natural association of authority with age, so &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; would be, almost inevitably, the designation of a superintendent. This process of natural selection was probably aided by the familiar use of the title In the clubs and guilds to designate functions analogous to those of the ecclesiastical administrator. The title can hardly be traced to the O.T. There are but two passages in lxx where the word has any connection with religious worship, <a href="/numbers/4-16.htm">Numbers 4:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>. It is applied to God (<a href="/job/20-29.htm">Job 20:29</a>), and in N.T. to Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-25.htm">1 Peter 2:25</a>). It is used of officers in the army and of overseers of workmen. The prevailing O.T. sense of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#768; is visitation for punishment, inquisition, or numbering.<p>He desireth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>See on <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>. </body></html>
