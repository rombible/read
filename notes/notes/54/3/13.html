The old translation perhaps is best. Alford writes strikingly on the change of tense: “They that <span class= "ital">have</span> used <span class= "ital">are</span> acquiring or purchasing.” The Apostle having begun by placing himself at the great day of retribution, now shifts the scene and deals with their present conduct. “Those who shall then be found to have served well, &c. . . . are now, &c.”<p>The “good degree” they are now purchasing by earnest, patient work may refer to advancement to the higher ministries of the Church, but, more probably, has reference to their future position in the blessed life to come. This is one of the passages not unfrequent in St. Paul’s Epistles, where degrees of glory among the redeemed are clearly spoken of. The plain words of St. Paul and his Master teach the people of God that although the great act of redemption alone belongs to Christ, that through His merits only men obtain salvation, still His own, will in a great measure determine, by their works and days on earth, the position they will occupy in His kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">And great boldness.</span>—The true and faithful deacons not only will in the life to come win the great reward, but <span class= "ital">here</span> the result of their loyal, earnest service would be, that before <span class= "ital">men</span> they would do their work with serene, fearless confidence, and would at the same time be encouraged to approach that <span class= "ital">heavenly Father</span> at all times with the loving trustfulness of children.<p><span class= "bld">In the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span>—Faith was the foundation of the “great boldness,” and <span class= "ital">the faith</span> rested on Jesus Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For they that have used the office of a deacon well - Margin, "ministered." The Greek word is the same as deacon, meaning ministering, or serving in this office. The sense would be well expressed by the phrase, "deaconizing well." The "word" implies nothing as to the exact nature of the office.<p>Purchase to themselves - Procure for themselves; see this word explained in the notes on <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>.<p>A good degree - The word here used (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  bathmos) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, "a step," as of a stair; and the fair meaning is that of going up higher, or taking an additional step of dignity, honor, or standing. So far as the "word" is concerned, it may mean either an advance in office, in dignity, in respectability, or in influence. It cannot certainly be inferred that the apostle referred to a higher grade of "office;" for all that the word essentially conveys is, that, by exercising this office well, a deacon would secure additional respectability and influence in the church. Still, it is possible that those who had performed the duties of this office well were appointed to be preachers. They may have shown so much piety, prudence, good sense, and ability to preside over the church, that it was judged proper that they should be advanced to the office of bishops or pastors of the churches. Such a course would not be unnatural. This is, however, far from teaching that the office of a deacon is a subordinate office, "with a view" to an ascent to a higher grade.<p>And great boldness in the faith - The word here rendered "boldness" properly refers to boldness "in speaking;" see it explained in the <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a> note; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12</a> note; <a href="/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a> note. But the word is commonly used to denote boldness of any kind - openness, frankness, confidence, assurance; <a href="//biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm">John 8:13</a>, <a href="/john/8-26.htm">John 8:26</a>; <a href="/mark/8-32.htm">Mark 8:32</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a>. As it is here connected with "faith" - "boldness in the faith" - it means, evidently, not so much public speaking, as a manly and independent exercise of faith in Christ. The sense is, that by the faithful performance of the duties of the office of a deacon, and by the kind of experience which a man would have in that office, he would establish a character of firmness in the faith, which would show that he was a decided Christian. This passage, therefore, cannot be fairly used to prove that the deacon was "a preacher," or that he belonged to a grade of ministerial office from which he was regularly to rise to that of a presbyter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. purchase to themselves a good degree&#8212;literally, "are acquiring &#8230; a &#8230; step." Understood by many as "a higher step," that is, promotion to the higher office of presbyter. But ambition of rising seems hardly the motive to faithfulness which the apostle would urge; besides, it would require the comparative, "a better degree." Then the past aorist participle, "they that used the office of deacon well," implies that the present verb, "are acquiring to themselves boldness," is the result of the completed action of using the diaconate well. Also, Paul would not probably hold out to every deacon the prospect of promotion to the presbytery in reward of his service. The idea of moving upwards in Church offices was as yet unknown (compare Ro 12:7, &c.; 1Co 12:4-11). Moreover, there seems little connection between reference to a higher Church rank and the words "great boldness." Therefore, what those who have faithfully discharged the diaconate acquire for themselves is "a good standing-place" [Alford] (a well-grounded hope of salvation) against the day of judgment, 1Ti 6:19; 1Co 3:13, 14 (the figurative meaning of "degree" or "step," being the degree of worth which one has obtained in the eye of God [Wiesinger]); and boldness (resting on that standing-place"), as well for preaching and admonishing others now (Eph 6:19; a firm standing forth for the truth against error), as also especially in relation to God their coming Judge, before whom they may be boldly confident (Ac 24:16; 1Jo 2:28; 3:21; 4:17; Heb 4:16).<p>in the faith&#8212;rather as Greek, "in faith," that is, boldness resting on their own faith.<p>which is in Christ Jesus&#8212;resting in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Purchase to themselves a good degree; </span> a good degree of honour, so that none hath reason to decline or to despise that office. This seems rather to be the sense, than what pleaseth some better, viz. that they purchase to themselves a higher degree in the ministry of the church; for though it be very probably true, and but rational, that the primitive church did out of their deacons choose their higher officers for the church, yet neither was this done universally as to all persons chosen into those high employments, nor as to all those that used the office of a deacon well, there doubtless being many who had done so, who yet were not didaktikoi, fitted with an ability sufficient to be preachers, without which fitness the primitive church would not choose any to such employment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus; </span> by the well performance also of the office of a deacon, many obtained a great liberty, or freedom of speech, parrhsian, as to the doctrine of the faith of Christ. For by the exercise of the deacon’s office, they had much converse both with the pastors and members of the church; which converse did not only improve their knowledge in the doctrine of faith, but took off that excessive bashfulness which possesseth many till they come to be fully acquainted with the thing of which, and the persons before which, they are to speak, which we see by daily experience. Or, the apostle intends that courage that arises from a good conscience. Those that are careless and unfaithful in the discharge of their duty, guilt makes them timorous; but the good and faithful servant of God enjoys that liberty and courage which faith in the Lord Jesus gives, and without fear discharges all the parts of his office. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For they that have used the office of a deacon well,....

To these instructions he adds in this verse a reason: <span class="greekheb">οἱ γὰρ καλῶς διακονήσαντες</span> (<span class="greekheb">διακονεῖν</span> is here and in <a href="/1_timothy/3-10.htm" title="And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.">1 Timothy 3:10</a> used in the official sense) <span class="greekheb">βαθμὸν ἑαυτοῖς καλὸν περιποιοῦνται</span>.[130] The word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΘΜΌς</span></span></span>, which occurs only here, denotes, like <span class="ital">gradus</span>, in the figurative sense, a degree of honour. As to what is to be understood by this, expositors are not agreed; but we may reject at once all explanations in which a comparative is put in place of the positive <span class="greekheb">καλόν</span>. This objection applies to the view that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΘΜΌς</span></span></span> denotes here the higher ecclesiastical office, the office of bishop (Jerome: “bonum hic pro gradu majori posuit; sunt enim minores [diaconi];” Bengel: “gradum ab humilitate diaconiae ad majora munera, in ecclesia. Qui in minore gradu fidelis est, ad majora promovetur;” so, too, Theophylact, Erasmus, Beza, Grotius, Heumann, Heydenreich, Baur, Plitt, and others), which view, moreover, presupposes a regulation of rank altogether foreign to the apostolic age. The same objection applies to the view that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΘΜῸς ΚΑΛΌς</span></span></span> is a higher stage of the life of faith, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> an increase in Christian perfection. The expositors who hold by the positive <span class="greekheb">καλός</span>, interpret the idea, some of the future, others of the present life. The <span class="ital">former</span> understand by it “a higher stage of blessedness;” so Theodoret (<span class="greekheb">τὸν τίμιον τοῦτον βαθμὸν ἐν τῷ μέλλοντι λήψονται βίῳ</span>), Flatt, and others; the <span class="ital">latter</span> explain the expression as applying to “respect in the church;” so Calvin, Planck, Wegscheider, Leo, Matthies, and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Heinrich, de “Wette, and Wiesinger agree with the view of the former, only modifying it to mean not a stage of holiness, but “the expectancy of it.” This modification is, however, unwarrantable, since the idea of “expectancy or claim” is imported. <span class="greekheb">βαθμός</span> means a stage; it cannot at the same time mean the claim to a stage; and if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΘΜΌς</span></span></span> must mean the claim to something, then there is nothing to indicate what the claim refers to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The decision between the two interpretations depends on the explanation of the words that follow: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΠΟΛΛῊΝ ΠΑῤῬΗΣΊΑΝ ἘΝ ΠΊΣΤΕΙ Τῇ ἘΝ ΧΡΙΣΤῷ ἸΗΣΟῦ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΠΑῤῬΗΣΊΑ</span></span></span> means, in the first place, candour in speech; then more generally, bold courage in action, synonymous with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΔΕΙΑ</span></span></span> (Hesychius); and lastly, firm confidence in something; thus in reference to men, <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm" title="Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.">2 Corinthians 7:4</a> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΛΛΉ ΜΟΙ ΠΑῤῬΗΣΊΑ ΠΡῸς ὙΜᾶς</span></span></span>), or to God, viz. the confidence which the Christian in faith has in the saving grace of God; so in the Epistle to the Hebrews and in the First Epistle of John.[131] If <span class="greekheb">βαθμός</span> is to be referred to future blessedness, then <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span> here, as in <a href="/1_john/3-21.htm" title="Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.">1 John 3:21</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>, is confidence toward God. But in <a href="/1_john/3-21.htm" title="Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.">1 John 3:21</a> we have <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span> along with <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span>, and in <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a> <span class="greekheb">μετὰ παῤῥησίας</span> is added to define more precisely the clause: <span class="greekheb">προσερχώμεθα τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος</span>; as to the parallel passage in <a href="/1_timothy/6-19.htm" title="Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.">1 Timothy 6:19</a>, to which de Wette likewise appeals, the reference to the future life is distinctly expressed by the words <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ μέλλον</span>. Of all this there is nothing here; there is nothing, either here or with <span class="greekheb">καλὸν βαθμόν</span>, to direct us to the future life, nothing to indicate that with <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span> we should supply <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span>, or the like. Hence it is more natural to refer these ideas to the sphere in which the <span class="greekheb">διακονεῖν</span> takes place, and to understand by <span class="greekheb">βαθμός</span>, respect in the church;[132] by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑῤῬΗΣΊΑ</span></span></span>, confidence in their official labours. These two things stand in closest relation to one another, since only <span class="ital">he</span> can possess right confidence in his office who is open to no just reproach, who is honoured for conducting himself well in the matters with which his office is concerned. Wiesinger, against this view, maintains that “the aorist (<span class="greekheb">διακονήσαντες</span>) makes the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΑΘΜῸΝ ἙΑΥΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΛ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΕΡΙΠ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> appear to be the <span class="ital">final result</span> of the official labour;”[133] but if that were the case, the present <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΠΟΙΟῦΝΤΑΙ</span></span></span> should not have been used, but the perfect; for the acquisition does not take place <span class="ital">after</span> the official labour, but during it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Certainly the aorist is somewhat strange; but it may mean that the <span class="greekheb">βαθμὸς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is always the result of good service.[134]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb <span class="greekheb">περιποιεῖσθαι</span>, in the N.

The construction of <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> following it, is found also in <a href="/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a> (only that in these passages there is no article before <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>, while there is one before <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>; on the other hand, comp. <a href="/acts/20-21.htm" title="Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.">Acts 20:21</a>; <a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>).

But that is not the case. Those qualities, not less than the one given in ver. 12, are the necessary conditions for filling the office of deacon well.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[131] Regarding Luther’s translation of <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span> by “joyfulness,” see my <span class="ital">Comment. on the Epistles of John , 3</span> d ed., on <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[132] Van Oosterzee’s opinion is manifestly wrong, that <span class="greekheb">βαθμός</span> is “a beautiful stage of the spiritual life, and also of eternal blessedness.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[133] The other grounds apply only to the exposition of Matthies, who understands by <span class="greekheb">βαθμὸς καλός</span> “the influential post;” by <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span>, “the free play of thought and speech, a wide open field of spiritual activity.” In this he certainly exceeds the meaning which may be assigned to these words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[134] Hofmann’s explanation of <span class="greekheb">βαθμός</span> and <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span> agrees in substance with that given here. He is wrong, however, in asserting that the deacons do not acquire both <span class="ital">during</span>, but only after their tenure of office. If the latter were the case, the means by which it takes place would not be given.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[135] Hofmann, indeed, holds even this connection of ideas to be unsuitable; but we do not see why the <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span> may not be marked as Christian, as rooted in faith in Christ. To connect it with what follows, would be to suppose that the apostle lays emphasis on a point, which to Timothy would be self-evident.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/3-13.htm" title="For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.">1 Timothy 3:13</a>. From what has been noted above on St. Paul’s teaching in relation to men’s lawful aspirations, it will appear that it is not necessary to explain away the obvious meaning of this clause in accordance with a false spirituality which affects to depreciate the inducements of earthly rewards. The parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:21</a>), implies Christ’s approval of reasonable ambition. Nor is this to be answered by a statement that “the recompense of reward” to which we are permitted to look is heavenly and spiritual. For the Christian, there can be no gulf fixed between the earthly and the heavenly; at least in the category of things which are open to him, as a Christian, to desire. The drawing of such distinctions is akin to the Manichaean disparagement of matter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">βαθμὸν καλόν</span> which the man may acquire who has served well as a deacon is <span class="ital">advancement</span> to the presbyterate or episcopate. So Chrys. The R.V., <span class="ital">gain to themselves a good standing</span>, does not necessarily imply an advance in rank, but an assured position in the esteem of their fellow-Christians. We know that among the many who possess the same rank, whether in church or state, some from their character and abilities gain a standing that others do not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some modern commentators follow Theodoret in giving a purely spiritual force to <span class="greekheb">βαθμόν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ μέλλοντι βίῳ</span>, “a good standing place, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, at the Great Day” (Alf.); “the step or degree which a faithful discharge of the <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> would gain in the eyes of God” (Ell.). Alf. lays emphasis on the aor. part. as viewing the <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> from the standpoint of the Day of Judgment; but it is equally suitable if the standpoint be that of the day on which they receive their advancement. There is more force in his emphasis on the present, <span class="greekheb">περιποιοῦνται</span>, <span class="ital">they are acquiring</span>. This interpretation does not seem to be in harmony with the context. The qualifications that are noted in <a href="/1_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.">1 Timothy 3:12</a> have relation to the effectual administration of the Church on earth. It would be harsh to affirm that one who was a digamist and who could not keep his household in order would suffer for it in the Day of Judgment, however unsuitable he might be for office in the church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πολλὴν παρρησίαν</span>: a Pauline phrase. See reff. In these passages <span class="greekheb">παρρ</span>. means <span class="ital">confidence</span>, without reference to <span class="ital">speech</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Although Ell. renders the clause “great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus,” he explains the boldness as resting on faith in Christ Jesus, and as descriptive of the believer’s attitude in regard to, and at, the Day of Judgment. See <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>. If we reject his explanation of <span class="greekheb">βαθμόν</span>, it would be natural to interpret <span class="greekheb">παρρ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., of a confident public expression of the faith, such as would belong to an experienced Christian who had gained a good standing, and had, in consequence, no temptation to be <span class="greekheb">δίλογος</span>.

In <a href="/1_timothy/6-19.htm" title="Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.">1 Timothy 6:19</a> the right use of wealth by the wealthy is the best <span class="ital">basis</span> for the whole of the life ‘which is life indeed’ to be gradually built up on, in the days yet to come on earth, and the unending day after: no spiritual life can be <span class="ital">sound</span> that is not built in and upon the faithful doing of our duty in that state of life to which it may please God to call us. An illustration of the metaphor may be taken from the building of Smeaton’s Eddystone Lighthouse and all lighthouses of the kind since. ‘All the lower courses of stone were joggled and <span class="ital">morticed into the rock</span>, hewn for that purpose into a series of <span class="ital">six steplike courses</span>. The lower portion of the building was solid throughout, and from its peculiar dovetailing practically <span class="ital">but one stone with the rock upon which it was raised</span>.’ So we may translate here with R.V. <span class="bld">they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing</span>, and interpret ‘good standing’ not to mean a higher post but good solid work done by them as deacons, leading (<span class="ital">a</span>) to ‘boldness of speech in the faith,’ the acceptable performance of functions such as St Stephen and St Philip, though deacons, were privileged to perform. We then gain a force for ‘to themselves’ in accordance with (<span class="ital">b</span>), adopting Theodore’s comment ‘though second in rank to presbyters, they will themselves have an esteem second to none,’ and (we may add) real ‘freedom in speaking’ too, from the consciousness of their people’s sympathy and support. Finally the life now is part only of the whole life; and ‘life is the use of the gifts of God according to the will of God’; hence good deacon’s work now is the basis (<span class="ital">c</span>) for a joyous expectation of the Master’s smile of approval, ‘ye have done it unto Me,’ a joyous acceptance of His seal of approval, ‘Be thou ruler over many things.’ See Appendix, K.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the faith which is in Christ Jesus</span>] Here, like ‘the faith of the Gospel’ in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-23.htm" title="But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.">Galatians 3:23</a> (see Bp Lightfoot), <span class="ital">objective</span>; the doctrine and scheme of ‘Christianity.’ Compare <a href="/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1</a>, ‘the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ’; Judges 3, ‘the faith once for all delivered unto the saints.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/3-13.htm" title="For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.">1 Timothy 3:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Βαθμὸν</span>) <span class="ital">a degree</span>, from the humble deaconship to the higher offices in the church.

It does not follow that St. Paul had in his mind their advancement from the "<span class="accented">inferior</span> office" to "<span class="accented">the</span> higher ministries in the Church" (Ordination Service); he may merely have meant to say that the discharge of the duties of a deacon in an efficient and exemplary manner raised a man to high estimation in the Church, and so gave him confidence in confessing the faith of Jesus Christ both by word and deed. <span class="accented">Gain to themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); acquire by purchase or otherwise.

Purchase is unfortunate from the point of modern usage; but it is employed in its original sense of to win, acquire, without any idea of a bargain. So Bacon, Ess. iv. 14: "There is no man doth a wrong for the wrong's sake; but thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or honor, or the like." And Shakespeare:<p>"Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition<p>Worthily purchased, take my daughter."<p>Temp iv. 1, 14<p>Rend. acquire or obtain for themselves.<p>A good degree (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, N.T.o.

In ecclesiastical writers, order, grade, rank: see, for instance, Eusebius, H. E. vii. 15. Also degree of relationship or affinity. Here the word apparently means a position of trust and influence in the church; possibly a promotion from the diaconate to the episcopate. Others (as De Wette, Ellicott, Pfleiderer) refer it to a high grade in the future life, which Holtzmann sarcastically describes as a ladder-round in heaven (eine Staffel im Himmel). John the Scholar, known as Climacus, a monk of the latter half of the sixth century, and Abbot of the Sinai Convent, wrote a mystical work entitled &#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; the Ladder of Paradise.

Its dominant idea is boldness, confidence, as opposed to fear, ambiguity, or reserve. The idea of publicity is sometimes attached to it, but as secondary. Only here in the Pastorals: several times in Paul, as <a href="/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>.

An assured position and blameless reputation in the church, with a pure conscience, would assure boldness of speech and of attitude in the Christian community and elsewhere.<p>In faith<p>Connect with boldness only.
