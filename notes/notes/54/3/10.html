Some, however, think that the apostle required, in this direction, that no one should be made either a bishop or a deacon, till he had given proof both of his steadfastness in the faith, and of his genuine piety and good conduct during a reasonable space of time after his conversion: or, that the persons admitted to these offices should be under trial for a while, how they conducted themselves therein, and then afterward, if they gave satisfaction, they should be confirmed in them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them.

It should be ascertained that they were grave, serious, temperate, trustworthy men; men who were sound in the faith, and who would not dishonor the office. It is not said here that there should be a "formal" trial, as if they were candidates for this office; but the meaning is, that they should have had an opportunity of making their character known, and should have gained such respect for their piety, and their other qualifications, that there would be reason to believe that they would perform the functions of the office well.

It is true that nothing has been said hitherto about an examination in regard to the office of presbyter; but, of course, such an examination must have preceded the election. The examination for the office of deacon would certainly refer to the life and stedfastness in the faith. He does not say who was to undertake the examination, but it is natural to suppose that it was to be undertaken by those who elected. At the first institution of the diaconate the <span class="ital">election</span> was made by the church, the installation to the office by the apostles. It is not known how it was managed later in the apostolic age. Heydenreich makes the examination too formal when he says: “They are to be examined first by Timothy, with the aid of the presbytery; the votes of the members of the church are to be taken concerning his worthiness,” etc. On the other hand, the force of <span class="greekheb">δοκιμαζέσθωσαν</span> must not be weakened by such explanations as: “Paul wishes only those to be made <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΆΚΟΝΟΙ</span></span></span> regarding whom a definite opinion had already been formed in the church” (so in the second edition of this commentary); or: “it is the moral testing which naturally took place when they lived for some time under the eyes of the church and its leader;” or: “it is in substance the same thing as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΝΕΌΦΥΤΟΝ</span></span></span>, used regarding the choice of presbyters” (Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is quite wrong, with Luther (“and these are first to be tried”) and others, to understand the words as if they meant that candidates were first to be tried in the affairs of the diaconate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἾΤΑ ΔΙΑΚΟΝΕΊΤΩΣΑΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΝΈΓΚΛΗΤΟΙ ὌΝΤΕς</span></span></span>] The participle expresses the condition under which they are to be admitted to the office of deacon. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΑΚΟΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, as applied definitely to the office of deacon, occurs only here, at <a href="/1_timothy/3-14.htm" title="These things write I to you, hoping to come to you shortly:">1 Timothy 3:14</a>, and in <a href="/1_peter/4-11.htm" title="If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

Yet Alford quotes the note while saying ‘there is no connexion by means of the conjunctions with the former requirements concerning presbyters.’ The test or proof here too is the judgment of the general community.
