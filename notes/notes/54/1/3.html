The false teachers who are disturbing the Church at Ephesus are not named. There is, perhaps, a ring of contempt in the expression “some,” but it seems more probable that the names were designedly omitted in this letter, which was intended to be a public document.

When the Apostle and his disciple Timothy re-visited Ephesus, after the long Cæsarean and Roman imprisonment, they found the Church there distracted with questions raised by Jewish teachers. The curious and hair-splitting interpretation of the Mosaic law, the teaching concerning the tithing of mint and anise and cummin, which in the days of Jesus of Nazareth had paralysed all real spiritual life in Jerusalem, had found its way during the Apostle’s long enforced absence into the restless, ever-changing congregations at Ephesus.<p>Dangerous controversies, disputings concerning old prophecies, mingled with modern traditions, occupied the attention of many of the Christian teachers. They preferred to talk about theology rather than try to live the life which men like St. Paul had told them that followers of Jesus must live if they would be His servants indeed.<p>Unless these deadening influences were removed, the faith of the Ephesian Church threatened to become utterly impractical. The <span class= "ital">doctrine</span> these restless men were teaching, and which St. Paul so bitterly condemns, seems to have been no settled form of heresy, but a profitless teaching, arising mainly, if not entirely, from Jewish sources.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,...">1 Timothy 1:3-4</a>. </span><span class="ital">As I besought thee </span>— <span class="greekheb">Παρεκαλεσα σε</span>, <span class="ital">I entreated thee. </span>It is observed by Beza, that by using this soft expression the apostle hath left a singular example of modesty, to be imitated by superiors in their behaviour toward their inferiors in the church. <span class="ital">When I went into Macedonia, </span>(<a href="/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.">Acts 20:1</a>,) <span class="ital">that thou mightest charge some </span>— Who appeared to be inclined to introduce their own corrupt notions into the church; <span class="ital">that they teach no other doctrine </span>— Than I have taught.

The apostle seems to have been the means of Timothy's conversion; who served with him in his ministry, as a dutiful son with a loving father. That which raises questions, is not for edifying; that which gives occasion for doubtful disputes, pulls down the church rather than builds it up. Godliness of heart and life can only be kept up and increased, by the exercise of faith in the truths and promises of God, through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus - It is clear from this, that Paul and Timothy had been laboring together at Ephesus, and the language accords with the supposition that Paul had been compelled to leave before he had completed what he had designed to do there.

If it had been a single direction or command, it might have been given by Paul himself before he left, but it seems rather to refer to that continuous instruction which would convince these various errorists and lead them to inculcate only the true doctrine. As they may have been numerous - as they may have embraced various forms of error, and as they might have had plausible grounds for their belief, this was evidently a work requiring time, and hence Timothy was left to effect this at leisure. It would seem that the wrath which had been excited against Paul had not affected Timothy, but that he was permitted to remain and labor without molestation. It is not certainly known who these teachers were, but they appear to have been of Jewish origin, and to have inculcated the special sentiments of the Jews respecting the law.<p>That they teach no other doctrine - That is, no other doctrine than that taught by the apostles. The Greek word here used is not found in the classic writers, and does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament, except in <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a> of this Epistle, where it is rendered "teach otherwise." We may learn here what was the design for which Timothy was left at Ephesus.<p>(1) it was for a temporary purpose, and not as a permanent arrangement. It was to correct certain errors prevailing there which Paul would have been able himself soon to correct if he had been suffered to remain. Paul expected soon to return to him again, and then they would proceed unitedly with their work; <a href="/1_timothy/4-13.htm">1 Timothy 4:13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>.<p>(2) it was not that he might be the "Bishop" of Ephesus. There is no evidence that he was "ordained" there at all, as the subscription to the Second Epistle declares (see the  notes on that subscription), nor were the functions which he was to perform, those of a prelatical bishop. He was not to take the charge of a "diocese," or to ordain ministers of the "second rank," or to administer the rite of confirmation, or to perform acts of discipline. He was left there for a purpose which is specified, and that is as far as possible from what are now regarded as the appropriate functions of a prelatical bishop. Perhaps no claim which has ever been set up has had less semblance of argument than that which asserts that Timothy was the "Bishop of Ephesus." See this clause examined in my "Inquiry into the Organization and Government of the Apostolic Church," pp. 84-107. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Timothy's superintendence of the Church at Ephesus was as locum tenens for the apostle, and so was temporary. Thus, the office of superintending overseer, needed for a time at Ephesus or Crete, in the absence of the presiding apostle, subsequently became a permanent institution on the removal, by death, of the apostles who heretofore superintended the churches. The first title of these overseers seems to have been "angels" (Re 1:20).<p>As I besought thee to abide still&#8212;He meant to have added, "so I still beseech thee," but does not complete the sentence until he does so virtually, not formally, at 1Ti 1:18.<p>at Ephesus&#8212;Paul, in Ac 20:25, declared to the Ephesian elders, "I know that ye all shall see my face no more." If, then, as the balance of arguments seems to favor (see [2462]Introduction), this Epistle was written subsequently to Paul's first imprisonment, the apparent discrepancy between his prophecy and the event may be reconciled by considering that the terms of the former were not that he should never visit Ephesus again (which this verse implies he did), but that they all should "see his face no more." I cannot think with Birks, that this verse is compatible with his theory, that Paul did not actually visit Ephesus, though in its immediate neighborhood (compare 1Ti 3:14; 4:13). The corresponding conjunction to "as" is not given, the sentence not being completed till it is virtually so at 1Ti 1:18.<p>I besought&#8212;a mild word, instead of authoritative command, to Timothy, as a fellow helper.<p>some&#8212;The indefinite pronoun is slightly contemptuous as to them (Ga 2:12; Jude 4), [Ellicott].<p>teach no other doctrine&#8212;than what I have taught (Ga 1:6-9). His prophetic bodings some years before (Ac 20:29, 30) were now being realized (compare 1Ti 6:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ephesus</span> was a great city in Asia the Less, whither Paul came, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1</a></span>; where Demetrius raised a tumult against him, which the town clerk appeased, as we read there.

Upon this his motion into Macedonia (as divines judge) he left Timothy at Ephesus. The end of leaving him at Ephesus was, that he might <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">charge some that they</span> preached <span class="bld">no other doctrine, </span> that is, none contrary to what he had preached, none contrary to the doctrine of the gospel, <span class="bld"><a href="/galatians/1-8.htm" title="But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:8</a>,9</span>. What power was here committed to Timothy is by some questioned; supposing (which is very probable) there were a greater number of disciples than could meet in one assembly, his power was more than pastoral, for he had a power over the teachers. Whether this power was extraordinary, or ordinary, and what God intended ever to continue in the chnrch, is the question. Those who make it to be such, make it to be episcopal; those that make it extraordinary, say it was the work of an evangelist, <span class="bld"><a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2 Timothy 4:5</a></span>. That there was such an officer in the primitive church appears from <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a> <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a></span>. That this was Timothy’s work appears from <span class="bld"><a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2 Timothy 4:5</a></span>. Nor is it a new thing, but very common in the settlement of all new governments, to authorize some special commissioners, and to give them an extraordinary power for a time, till the government can be settled and things brought into a fixed order. If we consider the words without prejudice: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, </span> they seem to signify that Timothy was not the established bishop of Ephesus; for to what end should the apostle desire a bishop to reside in his own diocess, which he could not forsake without neglecting his duty, and the offence of God? This were a tacit reflection, as if he were careless of his duty. And the word <span class="ital">abide, </span> prosmeinai, does not necessarily import his constant residence there; for it is used to signify continuance for some time only; as it is said of the apostle, that he remained many days at Corinth, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a></span>, when his stay there was only for some months. The intention of the apostle seems to be that Timothy should continue for a while at Ephesus, and not accompany him in his voyage to Macedonia, as he was wont to do upon other occasions. And it is evident by the sacred history, that about six months after Timothy was with the apostle in Greece, that he went with him to Macedonia, and Troas, and Miletus, <span class="bld"><a href="/acts/20-1.htm" title="And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.">Acts 20:1</a>,4</span>, where the apostle sent for the elders or bishops of Ephesus, to leave his last solemn charge with them. In short, if Timothy had been appointed the bishop of Ephesus, the apostle would probably have given this title of honour to him in the inscription of his Epistle. Upon the impartial considering of the whole matter, though the passion of prelacy is so ingenious as to discover so many mysteries and mitres in a few plain words, (viz. that Timothy was bishop of that city, metropolitan of the province, and primate of all Asia), yet it is most likely that Timothy was left only for some time with a kind of apostolical power in the church of Ephesus; of which power this was one branch, authoritatively to command seducers not to teach another doctrine than what was taught by the apostles, who were Divinely illuminated: a Divine rule, and most worthy of perpetual observation by all in the office of the ministry. And this showeth the mighty proneness of men, as to deviate in their conversations, from the right ways, so in their judgments from the truths of God, otherwise Paul had no need to have left Timothy for that end in this church so newly planted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As I besought thee to abide, still at Ephesus,.... Where it seems he now was, being left here by the apostle, and where he was desired by him to continue: <p>when I went into Macedonia; not when he went his first journey there, for Timothy was then along with him, <a href="/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a> and so he seems to be in his journey through it, in <a href="/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>. It may be this may refer to a journey which Luke has given no account of: <p>that thou mightest charge some, that they teach no other doctrine; than the doctrine of Christ and his apostles; than what had been preached by the apostle at Ephesus, and the saints there had received; than what was agreeably to the Scriptures of truth, and was according to godliness; for all other doctrines must be divers and strange ones: nor would he have them teach in another way, in new words, but hold fast the form of sound words; for new words often produce new doctrines: the apostle perhaps by other doctrine chiefly respects the doctrine of justification by the works of the law. It seems as if there were some teachers in this place the apostle was suspicious of, or he had heard that they began to innovate in the doctrine of faith; wherefore he desires Timothy to continue a while, in order to be a check on these persons, and to charge them not to introduce any new doctrine; for it was only "some", and not all that taught there, he was so to charge. Some refer this to hearers; and render, the words, "that they follow no other doctrine"; but it seems best to understand it of teachers; the Syriac and Arabic versions render the words as we do. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</span><p>(2) This whole epistle consists in admonitions, in which all the duties of a faithful pastor are plainly set out.

The apostle reminds Timothy, in the first place, of a previous exhortation, obviously for the purpose of impressing it more deeply on him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The most natural construction of the sentence appears to be, to take it as an anacolouthon, to connect <span class="greekheb">ἐν Ἐφέσῳ</span> with <span class="greekheb">προσμεῖναι</span>, to refer <span class="greekheb">πορευόμενος</span> to the subject of <span class="greekheb">παρεκάλεσα</span>, and to make <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> dependent on <span class="greekheb">παρεκαλεσά σε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. This construction is held by most expositors to be the only admissible one. The missing apodosis cannot, however, be supplied before <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, because <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is closely connected with what precedes; we may insert with Erasmus “ita facito,” or with Beza “vide,” or with most expositors “<span class="greekheb">οὕτω καὶ νῦν παρακαλῶ</span>” (Winer, p. 530 [E. T. p. 592]). The peculiarity in such an involuntary (Buttm. p. 331) anacolouthon is, that the grammatical connection is not established by inserting the omitted apodosis. The most simple course is to suppose that the apostle had “<span class="greekheb">οὕτω καὶ νῦν παρακαλῶ</span>” or “<span class="greekheb">οὕτω ποίει</span>,” in mind, but the place for it was lost in the abundance of the thoughts that streamed in on him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Several expositors depart from the construction commonly accepted. Matthies takes <span class="greekheb">προσμεῖναι</span> as “stay,” not as “remain behind,” refers <span class="greekheb">πορευόμενος</span> not to the subject of <span class="greekheb">παρεκάλεσα</span>, but to <span class="greekheb">σε</span> (making an unjustifiable appeal to <a href="/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,...">Ephesians 3:17-18</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,...">Ephesians 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>[40]), and explains the whole thus: When Timothy was intending to travel to Macedonia, Paul had charged him to stop at Ephesus and remain there. Schneckenburger (see his <span class="ital">Beiträge z. Einl.</span> pp. 182 ff.) arbitrarily changes the infin. <span class="greekheb">προσμεῖναι</span> into the partic. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΕΊΝΑς</span></span></span>, and refers <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΕΥΌΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span> to the following clause: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ΠΑΡΑΓΓΕΊΛῌς</span></span></span>. Otto treats <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΕΥΌΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span> in the same way, at the same time connecting <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΦΈΣῼ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΕΚΆΛΕΣΑ</span></span></span>, taking <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΕῖΝΑΙ</span></span></span> in an absolute sense, making the apodosis begin with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span>, and translating: “Just as I exhorted you to stand firm in Ephesus, so shalt thou on the journey to Macedonia command the people not to give attention to strange teachers, nor to hold them in esteem,” etc. This construction is, however, so artificial, that it is obviously incorrect to every one who is not blinded by the desire of placing the date of the composition of the epistle in a period of the apostle’s life known to us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[40] In the passages quoted, Paul adds the participles to the previous clauses in the nom., and these participial clauses thus acquire the independence due to them according to the context. But in these passages the relation of the participial clause to the preceding main clause is quite different from what it is here, where there is no reason whatever for departing from the regular construction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In order to justify his view of the sentence, Otto tries to prove the incorrectness of the usual construction, and to get rid of the objections to his own. The hypothesis of an ellipsis he rejects on account of the rule that the emphatic word can never be omitted, and that if we supply the apodosis by “<span class="greekheb">οὕτω καὶ νῦν παρακαλῶ</span>,” the emphatic words are <span class="greekheb">καὶ νῦν</span>. But these words are not by any means the most emphatic. The apostle might be using them not specially of the contrast between past and present, but only to give point to his former exhortation; hence he might easily omit the apodosis. Otto further maintains, that in the usual construction <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>, which always denotes a material, actual correspondence, even to identity of motives, and further, of material contents, does not get its full force. On this point we indeed grant that the peculiar meaning of <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> (as distinguished from <span class="greekheb">ὠς</span>) is not distinctly marked by the expositors; but it is not at all necessary in the usual interpretation to weaken arbitrarily the force of <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>, since the apostle’s former exhortation could not but be his guide in the present one. Still less difficulty, however, is presented by <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>, if we choose to supply <span class="greekheb">οὕτω ποίει</span> (as Hofmann does), since the meaning then is, that Timothy’s conduct is to be conformed to the exhortation already given by the apostle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Otto tries further to show that in the usual explanation the participle <span class="greekheb">πορευόμενος</span> is not in its proper place. The rules which Otto lays down on the subject of participial clauses in order to support his assertion are, on the whole, not incorrect. The passages he quotes from the N. T. certainly show that the participle following a finite verb mostly defines it more precisely; that it either explains more precisely the verbal notion, or gives the accompanying circumstances of the verb. But Otto has overlooked the departures from this rule which occur in the N. T.; comp. <a href="/luke/4-40.htm" title="Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.">Luke 4:40</a> with <a href="/mark/1-31.htm" title="And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.">Mark 1:31</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-49.htm" title="And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!">Matthew 12:49</a> with <a href="/acts/26-1.htm" title="Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:">Acts 26:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-15.htm" title="Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.">Matthew 22:15</a> with <a href="/matthew/12-14.htm" title="Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.">Matthew 12:14</a>; further, <a href="/luke/24-17.htm" title="And he said to them, What manner of communications are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?">Luke 24:17</a>.[41] It cannot be denied that the participle following sometimes gives simply the time in which the action of the finite verb takes place; that here, therefore, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΕΥΌΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span> may simply denote the time of the former exhortation.[42] Otto quotes the passage in <a href="/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a> as supporting the rule that the participle following should serve to explain the verbal notion, and justifies this by saying that the participle <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΡΏΣΑΝΤΕς ΤῊΝ ΔΙΑΚΟΝΊΑΝ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">gives the motive</span> of the return. But to give the motive is no explanation. In this passage, however, the position of the participle after the finite verb is justified in this way, that it gives the motive for the action expressed by the finite verb. So, too, in the passage here there is nothing to be said against the connection of <span class="greekheb">πορευόμενος</span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΕΚΆΛΕΣΑ</span></span></span>, so soon as we suppose that the journey <span class="ital">was the</span> <span class="ital">occasion</span> for Paul giving Timothy the exhortation in question. Lastly, Otto attacks the usual construction from the notion of <span class="greekheb">προσμεῖναι</span>, because this word is explained in the construction to be equivalent to “remain, stay;” whereas, when not connected with a dative (or with a participial clause representing a dative), but standing absolutely, it has the meaning: “to maintain the position hitherto possessed, to stand firm.” Hence, if any definition of place is added, it is not as a completion of the verbal notion, but only indicates where the standing firm takes place. Otto infers from this: “accordingly <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΦΈΣῼ</span></span></span> here does not complete <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΕῖΝΑΙ</span></span></span>, but rather <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΕῖΝΑΙ</span></span></span> is absolute, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΦΈΣῼ</span></span></span> gives the place at which the whole sentence, viz. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΕΚΆΛΕΣΆ ΣΕ ΠΡΟΣΜΕῖΝΑΙ</span></span></span>, took place.” This inference is obviously incorrect, since from Otto’s premises it only follows that, if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΦΈΣῼ</span></span></span> belongs to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΕῖΝΑΙ</span></span></span>, the place is thus given where Timothy is to stand fast,—in particular against the heretics,—it does not follow that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΦΈΣῼ</span></span></span> may be connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΕῖΝΑΙ</span></span></span>. Besides, from <a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>, it is clear beyond dispute that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΈΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span> does occur in the N. T. in the weakened sense of “remain, stay.”[43] Otto does not disguise the objections to his view, but he thinks that when thoroughly weighed they are more apparent than real. In this, too, he is wrong. It is indeed right to say that in the N. T. a sentence often begins with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> without any verb preceding on which it depends,—and this not only in cases where the governing verbal notion is easily supplied from what precedes, as in <a href="/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a>; <a href="/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>; <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>, but also when that is not the case, so that the clause beginning with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> stands as an imperative clause, as in <a href="/ephesians/5-33.htm" title="Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.">Ephesians 5:33</a>; <a href="/mark/5-23.htm" title="And sought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: I pray you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.">Mark 5:23</a> (comp. Buttm. pp. 207 f.). But in all passages where <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> is used elliptically, this is shown clearly and distinctly by the form of the sentence, which is not the case here. It is right also to say that emphatic parts of the clause construed with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> are often placed before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span>, so that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΕΥΌΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>, therefore, might very well be connected with the clause following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span>; but this, too, is always indicated clearly by the form of the sentence. Wherever words standing before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> are to be referred to what follows <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span>, these words cannot possibly be connected with what precedes them, and the part of the sentence following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> is incomplete in itself, so that it has to be taken along with the part before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span>. It is wrong to maintain that the participial clause <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΡΕΥΌΜΕΝΟς ΕἸς ΜΑΚΕΔ</span></span></span>. becomes emphatic by contrast with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΦΈΣῼ</span></span></span>, inasmuch as what took place in <span class="ital">Ephesus</span> is now to take place also <span class="ital">on the journey to Macedonia;</span> for—the two things are not at all the same. In Ephesus (according to Otto’s view), Paul exhorted Timothy to stand firm; but on the journey to Macedonia, Timothy is to encounter those who had been led astray. Lastly, it is right to assume that the sender of a letter, if he has anything to say of the place from which the letter is sent, may speak of it by name, comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-8.htm" title="But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐν Ἐφέσῳ</span> might convey to us that Paul was himself in Ephesus while writing; but we must take into consideration the special circumstances of the case. According to Otto, our epistle is a paper of instructions which the apostle put into Timothy’s hands in Ephesus, where he wrote it before setting out for Macedonia. In that case it was improper to mention the place by name. We cannot understand, then, why Paul in such a paper of instructions should have laid special stress on the exhortation he had imparted to Timothy <span class="ital">in the very place</span> where he put that paper into his hands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[41] Otto tries to weaken the force of this passage against him by assuming a rhetorical inversion, because, he says, it is declared “that taking a walk and holding solemn dispute are inconsistent with one another” (!).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[42] In his groundless denial of this, Otto thinks that if <span class="greekheb">πορευόμενος</span> be joined to <span class="greekheb">παρεκάλεσα</span> it must be assumed to be a circumstance accompanying the <span class="greekheb">παρεκάλεσα</span>, but that this assumption is impossible, since a <span class="ital">continuing</span> fact (part. pres.) cannot be regarded as the accompanying circumstance of a <span class="ital">concluded</span> fact (part. aor.). But Otto overlooks the fact that <span class="greekheb">πορευόμενος</span> in this connection is not to be understood in the sense of continuing a journey, but in the sense of beginning one, of setting out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[43] In this passage, also, Otto claims for <span class="greekheb">προσμένειν</span>, as a vox militaris, the meaning: “keep one’s ground,” remarking, “for the circumstances in Corinth were such that they might well have induced Paul to cease his labours and depart.” But this assertion is in contradiction with Luke’s statement, that the attack attempted by the Jews through Gallio was decisively warded off. Otto’s explanation, too, becomes all the more unsuitable, since, according to it, Luke would charge the apostle with not holding his ground more, and with abandoning his post.—Further, Otto seems to hesitate whether to take <span class="greekheb">προσμεῖναι</span> in the present passage as really absolute, or whether to supply with it the dative <span class="greekheb">ἐμοί</span>. After finally deciding for the former, he then explains <span class="greekheb">προσμεῖναι</span> as “keeping ground along with the leader appointed by God in the struggle against all the attacks of the heretic,” and thus in self-contradiction returns to the latter, since this leader is the Apostle Paul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some expositors take the whole section <a href="/context/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:...">1 Timothy 1:5-17</a> to be a parenthesis, and <a href="/1_timothy/1-18.htm" title="This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;">1 Timothy 1:18</a> to be the apodosis corresponding to <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>. The awkwardness of this construction is obvious; but Plitt thinks that, though it is not without its difficulties, most may be said for it. He is wrong, however, since <span class="greekheb">ταύτην τὴν παραγγελίαν</span>, in <a href="/1_timothy/1-18.htm" title="This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;">1 Timothy 1:18</a>, does not resume the <span class="greekheb">παρεκάλεσά σε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we avoid all subtleties, we cannot but explain it: <span class="ital">Even as I exhorted thee to remain in Ephesus when I set out for Macedonia, that thou mightst command certain men not to teach false doctrine … even so do</span> (or: <span class="ital">even so I exhort thee also now</span>).[44] Regarding the meaning of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΏς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΜΕῖΝΑΙ</span></span></span>, see the above remark.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΕΚΆΛΕΣΑ</span></span></span>] Chrys.: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΚΟΥΕ ΤῸ ΠΡΟΣΗΝΈς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Πῶς Οὐ ΔΙΔΑΣΚΆΛΟΥ ΚΈΧΡΗΤΑΙ ῬΩΜῇ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛʼ ΟἸΚΈΤΟΥ ΣΧΕΔΌΝ</span>· <span class="greekheb">Οὐ ΓᾺΡ ΕἾΠΕΝ ἘΠΈΤΑΞΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΔῈ ἘΚΈΛΕΥΣΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΔῈ ΠΑΡῄΝΕΣΑ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛᾺ ΤΊ</span>; <span class="greekheb">ΠΑΡΕΚΆΛΕΣΆ ΣΕ</span></span></span>.

A reed shaken with the wind?">Matthew 11:7</a>) and connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΌ</span></span></span> (<a href="/matthew/24-1.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.">Matthew 24:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm" title="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-15.htm" title="And he laid his hands on them, and departed there.">Matthew 19:15</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΕῖΘΕΝ</span></span></span>; <a href="/luke/13-31.htm" title="The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill you.">Luke 13:31</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΤΕῦΘΕΝ</span></span></span>). Otto explains it: “on the way to Macedonia,” which is grammatically correct, but opposed to the connection of ideas. There is no ground whatever for thinking that Paul, in this expression, had in mind one particular place on the way to Macedonia, viz. Corinth. We can see no reason why Paul should have expressed himself indefinitely. Otto, indeed, is of opinion that Timothy could not have been uncertain about the meaning of the expression; and that the apostle chose it in order to spare the feelings of the Corinthians, and that he might not confess to the heretics how they had provoked his apostolic opposition to an exceptional degree. But the first reason proves too much, since Paul, if he refrained from the definite expression because Timothy knew his wishes without it, would also have refrained from the indefinite expression. The other two reasons are weak, because if Timothy was to labour successfully against the heretics, he must necessarily appeal to the authority of the apostle in whose name he was to labour. Besides, such playing at hide-and-seek as Otto imputes to the apostle, is in entire contradiction with Paul’s frank character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ΠΑΡΑΓΓΕΊΛῌς Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] gives the purpose for which Timothy was to remain in Ephesus.

having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>. The presence of good men is a restraint upon the wicked. Timothy at Ephesus, Titus at Crete, were not bishops, but were directors of the bishops, and, so to speak, Vicars Apostolic.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to teach no other doctrine</span>) than that which I have taught.

Comp. the address of Paul to these same Ephesians, <a href="/context/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood....">Acts 20:28-30</a>. The same word occurs, ch. <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm" title="If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;">1 Timothy 6:3</a>, where those things which are contrary [to wholesome doctrine] are condemned, just as at the beginning of the epistle, the things which are good are commended. Even the things which seem to be only <span class="ital">different</span> (“<span class="ital">other</span> doctrine”), carry with them something which is positively <span class="ital">contrary</span> [to the true doctrine]. They taught the law, in opposition to the Gospel, <a href="/1_timothy/1-7.htm" title="Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.">1 Timothy 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1 Timothy 1:11</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="accented">Exhorted</span> for <span class="accented">besought</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tarry</span> for <span class="accented">abide still</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">was going</span> for <span class="accented">went</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">certain men</span> for <span class="accented">some</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">not to teach a different</span> for <span class="accented">that they teach no other</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Exhorted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). In about sixty places this word has the sense of "beseech," "entreat," "desire," "pray," which is more suitable to this passage than the R.V. <span class="accented">exhort</span>. It is a strong expression, and seems to imply that Timothy had been anxious to go with St. Paul to Macedonia, to share his labors and wait upon him; but that St. Paul, with that noble disinterestedness which characterized his whole life, had, not without difficulty, persuaded him to abide at Ephesus. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry</span>. Here again the R.V. is unfortunate. The exact sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is "to stay on," or, as in the A.V., "to abide still." The word tells us that Timothy was already at Ephesus when he received the request from St. Paul to stay on there instead of going to Macedonia. There is nothing in the phrase that implies that St. Paul was at Ephesus himself when he made the request to Timothy. It may have been made by message or by letter. <span class="cmt_word">When I was going.</span> Some commentators have endeavored to explain <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as applying to Timothy, or as if the order were <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>; but the Greek will not admit of it. <span class="cmt_word">Charge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>); a word implying authority, almost invariably rendered "command" or "charge." It is taken up in ver. 18 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), "This charge," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Teach a different doctrine</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is one of the many words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles. It only occurs here and <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>. It is formed from <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a teacher of other than right doctrine, and means "to play the part of a teacher of other than right doctrine," just as in ecclesiastical language <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "one who holds opinions contrary to that which is orthodox," and such as do so are said <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. The classical sense is a little different, "one who holds a different opinion" - "to be of a different opinion." The introduction of the word into the vocabulary of Scripture is a sign of the somewhat later age to which this Epistle belongs, when heresies were growing and multiplying. Other similar compounds are <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Even as (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>An awkward construction, there being nothing to answer to &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;.<p>To abide (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>To continue on.
