The sum of it was that men should put their whole trust in Him who came into the world to save sinners, and who alone was able to lead them into everlasting life. There is something very solemn in St. Paul’s pressing home this charge to Timothy, and invoking the memory of the prophecies which went before on him. The charge was the last precious heritage, the priceless treasure which the old master, feeling that for him the end was not far distant, would leave to his favourite disciple—his own dear son in the faith. Anxious above measure for the loved group of Asian churches, of which Ephesus was the centre, foreseeing that the present perils and dangers from within and without would rapidly close round the congregations, and placing his greatest earthly hope on the steadfastness and knowledge of his own dear disciple whom he had left there as a shepherd to the sheep, he charges his son Timothy, by the memory of those strange prophetic utterances which, years before, had been made over him (<a href="/context/acts/17-1.htm" title="Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:">Acts 17:1-2</a>) in Lystra or Derbe, and which, perhaps, had first induced him to choose the young son of Eunice as his friend and companion, to hold fast the blessed doctrine which taught men to put their whole trust in Jesus Christ.<p><span class= "bld">According to the prophecies which went before on thee.</span>—These prophetic utterances seem to have been not unfrequent in the days of the Apostles, and were among the precious gifts which enriched and encouraged the Church of the first days. We read of them at Jerusalem (<a href="/context/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27-28</a>), at Antioch (<a href="/context/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1-2</a>), at Corinth (1 Corinthians 14), at Cæsarea (<a href="/context/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8-10</a>).<p>In the case of Timothy they appear to have been farseeing glances into the life and the work and the teaching of the future Christian leader; here the last named—the doctrine and teaching—is especially referred to. The prophecies in question were uttered, no doubt, over him at his ordination, and, possibly, some of them at his baptism.<p><span class= "bld">That thou by them mightest war a good</span> warfare.—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">that thou in them, </span>&c. St. Paul committed the sacred charge to Timothy concerning the faith in full confidence that, in accordance with those well-remembered glorious predictions which had been made foretelling his future zeal and success in the promulgation of the gospel, that in these—accoutred in these as his spiritual protection and armour—Timothy would wage his warfare against sin and evil.<p>St. Paul’s words in this verse may be thus paraphrased: I give this charge to you, son Timothy, in accordance with those well-remembered predictions respecting your future steadfastness in doctrine and in life. I remind you now of them, Do not disappoint these grand hopes—these prophecies of your future—but bear them ever in your mind. Equip yourself in them as your spiritual armour, and so armed, fight your Master’s fight against sin and evil—eine gute Ritterschaft, according to Luther.<p>The war imagery here used St. Paul employs again and again: <span class= "ital">the</span> good warfare. (Comp. <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1Timothy 6:12</a>.) To the old, tried Apostle a Christian’s life is a warfare in the truest sense of the word: to every believer it is a weary, painful campaign. In the case of the professed teachers a sleepless vigilance was especially demanded.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/1-18.htm" title="This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;...">1 Timothy 1:18-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">This charge </span>— To the Judaizers not to teach differently, or this office of the ministry; <span class="ital">I commit unto thee </span>— That thou mayest deliver it to the church; <span class="ital">according to </span>— Or, being encouraged by; <span class="ital">the prophecies which went before on thee </span>— He refers to some special revelations concerning Timothy, that he should be taken into the ministry, and be eminently useful therein; probably these were uttered when he was first received as an evangelist, (see <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.">1 Timothy 4:14</a>,) and that by many persons, <a href="/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a>. <span class="ital">That </span>being assured <span class="ital">by them </span>that thy calling is from God, and that his grace and blessing will accompany thee, <span class="ital">thou mightest war a good warfare — </span>Mightest execute thy office with courage, resolution, and persevering diligence, notwithstanding all opposition and discouragements whatever. <span class="ital">Holding fast </span>a true and lively <span class="ital">faith </span>— In the gospel and its divine Author; <span class="ital">and a good conscience </span>— That is, walking uprightly before God and man, according to the directions of an enlightened and renewed mind; <span class="ital">which </span>— Namely, a good conscience; <span class="ital">some</span> — <span class="greekheb">Απωσαμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">having thrust away, </span>or <span class="ital">rejected. </span>“It departs unwillingly,” says Bengelius, “it always says; ‘Do not hurt me;’ and they who retain this, do not easily make shipwreck of their faith.” Indeed, none can make shipwreck of faith who never had faith. The persons here spoken of, therefore, were once true believers; yet they fell, not only foully, but finally. For ships once wrecked cannot be afterward saved. “In this metaphorical passage the apostle insinuates that a good conscience is the pilot, who must guide us in our voyage through the stormy sea of this life into the harbour of heaven.” <span class="ital">Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander </span>— Two of the corrupt teachers at Ephesus, whom Timothy was left to oppose; <span class="ital">whom I have delivered unto Satan </span>— See on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <span class="ital">that they may learn not to blaspheme </span>— That by what they suffer they may be, in some measure, restrained from speaking evil of the truths of God. The apostles delivered obstinate offenders to Satan, not only for their own reformation, but to strike terror on others. If the offender, in consequence of this punishment, was afflicted with some bodily disease, it probably was removed on his repentance, or after a time. And even though it continued, some of the offenders may have been so obstinate in their wicked courses, that they did not amend. This seems to have been the case with the two persons here named; “for notwithstanding the apostle, after his departure, punished them by delivering them to Satan, they persevered in spreading their erroneous doctrines, <a href="/2_timothy/2-17.htm" title="And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;">2 Timothy 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2 Timothy 4:14</a>. At what time the apostle delivered these persons to Satan does not appear; but from his informing Timothy of it as a thing he did not know, it may be conjectured that the apostle did it after he left Ephesus, and was come into Macedonia, probably immediately before he wrote this epistle. And as it was done without the knowledge or concurrence of the church at Ephesus, it was not the censure called <span class="ital">excommunication, </span>but an exercise of miraculous power, which was peculiar to him as an apostle.” — Macknight. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-20 The ministry is a warfare against sin and Satan; carried on under the Lord Jesus, who is the Captain of our salvation. The good hopes others have had of us, should stir us up to duty. And let us be upright in our conduct in all things. The design of the highest censures in the primitive church, was, to prevent further sin, and to reclaim the sinner. May all who are tempted to put away a good conscience, and to abuse the gospel, remember that this is the way to make shipwreck of faith also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This charge - This command or injunction. It does not refer to any "charge," or "cure," which he had as bishop or minister, as the word is sometimes used now, but to the commands or injunctions which he was delivering to him. The command particularly referred to is that in <a href="/1_timothy/1-8.htm">1 Timothy 1:8</a>.<p>According to the prophecies which went before on thee - The general meaning of this is plain. It is, that Paul was committing to him an important trust, and one that required great wisdom and fidelity; and that in doing it he was acting in conformity with the hopes which had been cherished respecting Timothy, and with certain expressed anticipations about his influence in the church. From early life the hope had been entertained that he would be a man to whom important trusts might be committed; and it had been predicted that he would be distinguished as a friend of religion. These hopes seem to have been cherished in consequence of the careful training in religion which he had had <a href="/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>, and probably from the early indications of seriousness, prudence, and piety, which he manifested. It was natural to entertain such hopes, and it seems, from this place, that such hopes had even assumed the form of predictions.<p>It is not absolutely necessary to suppose that these predictions referred to by the word prophecies were inspired, for the word may be used in a popular sense, as it is often now. We speak now familiarly of predicting or foretelling the future usefulness of a serious, prudent, studious, and pious youth. We argue from what he is, to what he will be, and we do not deem it unsafe or improper to hazard the prediction that, if he lives, he will be a man to whom important interests may be entrusted. As there were, however. prophets in the Christian church (<a href="/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a> note; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a> notes), and as it is possible that in some cases they were inspired to foretell future events, it cannot be regarded as improper to suppose that some of them had foretold the future usefulness of this religiously educated youth. Whatever may be meant by the expression, this general observation may be made, that when a young man enters on the active duties of life, and when great interests are entrusted to him, it is not improper to remind him of the hopes which had been cherished of him; of the anticipations which had been formed of his future usefulness; and of the expressions which have been used by the pious and the discerning respecting his future character. This is a kind of reminiscence which will rather increase his sense of responsibility than flatter his vanity; and it may be made a means of exciting him to diligence and fidelity. A virtuous young man will not willingly disappoint the long-cherished hopes of his friends. He will be likely to be made more diligent by the remembrance of all their fond anticipations of his future success.<p>That thou by them - By those prophecies. That is, that being stimulated and excited by those predictions and hopes, you might be led to fidelity and usefulness.<p>Mightest war a good warfare - The Christian life is often compared to a warfare or struggle for victory (compare <a href="//biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), and the services of the Christian ministry especially are likened to those of a soldier; <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>. The meaning here is, that he should contend with earnestness as a Christian and a minister in that holy service in which he was engaged, and endeavor to secure the victory. He "wars a good warfare" who is engaged in a righteous cause; who is faithful to his commander and to his post; who is unslumbering in observing the motions of the enemy, and fearless in courage in meeting them; who never forsakes his standard, and who continues thus faithful until the period of his enlistment has expired, or until death. Such a soldier the Christian minister should be. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. He resumes the subject begun at 1Ti 1:3. The conclusion (apodosis) to the foregoing, "as I besought thee &#8230; charge" (1Ti 1:3), is here given, if not formally, at least substantially.<p>This charge&#8212;namely, "that thou in them (so the Greek) mightest war," that is, fulfil thy high calling, not only as a Christian, but as a minister officially, one function of which is, to "charge some that they teach no other doctrine" (1Ti 1:3).<p>I commit&#8212;as a sacred deposit (1Ti 6:20; 2Ti 2:2) to be laid before thy hearers.<p>according to&#8212;in pursuance of; in consonance with.<p>the prophecies which went before on thee&#8212;the intimations given by prophets respecting thee at thy ordination, 1Ti 4:14 (as, probably, by Silas, a companion of Paul, and "a prophet," Ac 15:32). Such prophetical intimation, as well as the good report given of Timothy by the brethren (Ac 16:2), may have induced Paul to take him as his companion. Compare similar prophecies as to others: Ac 13:1-3, in connection with laying on of hands; Ac 11:28; 21:10, 11; compare 1Co 12:10; 14:1; Eph 4:11. In Ac 20:28, it is expressly said that "the Holy Ghost had made them (the Ephesian presbyters) overseers." Clement of Rome [Epistle to the Corinthians], states it was the custom of the apostles "to make trial by the Spirit," that is, by the "power of discerning," in order to determine who were to be overseers and deacons in the several churches planted. So Clement of Alexandria says as to the churches near Ephesus, that the overseers were marked out for ordination by a revelation of the Holy Ghost to St. John.<p>by them&#8212;Greek, "in them"; arrayed as it were in them; armed with them.<p>warfare&#8212;not the mere "fight" (1Ti 6:12; 2Ti 4:7), but the whole campaign; the military service.

The interpretation: <span class="ital">in accordance with them</span> (van Oosterzee, Hofmann: “the prophecies are to be regarded as a rule of conduct”), is against the usage of the N. T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] Hofmann wrongly maintains that this construction is impossible in point of language and in point of fact: “in point of language, because <span class="greekheb">παρατίθεσθαι</span> does not mean <span class="ital">lay to heart</span>, but <span class="ital">propose</span>, and a command is not proposed (why not?); in point of fact, because what he calls <span class="greekheb">τὰς προαγούσας ἐπί σε</span> cannot furnish any standard for the apostle’s injunction to Timothy to discharge his office well” (why not?).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] In <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm" title="Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man which sowed good seed in his field:">Matthew 13:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-31.htm" title="Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:">Matthew 13:31</a>, it is joined with <span class="greekheb">παραβολήν</span>; it is used of setting forth a doctrine in <a href="/acts/17-3.htm" title="Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ.">Acts 17:3</a>; it is chiefly used of setting forth food, as in the N.

Lünemann and Delitzsch on the passage. Otto is wrong in asserting that <span class="greekheb">προάγειν</span> is never used of priority of time.

(<span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="/matthew/26-32.htm" title="But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.">Matthew 26:32</a>; <a href="/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>) the meaning practically of “go before some one in any direction whatever,” the notion of space manifestly passing into that of time. In the passage in Hebrews, Otto thinks that <span class="greekheb">προάγουσα</span> ought to mean: “driving forward from one election of high priest to another” (!).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] In taking the words thus: <span class="greekheb">αἱ ἐπὶ σὲ προφητεῖαι</span>, there is not, as Otto maintains, a change of order not occurring in Greek; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.">2 Corinthians 8:2</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἡ κατὰ βάθους πτωχεία αὐτῶν</span>.
