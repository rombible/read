Hymenæus is probably identical with the heretic of that name, charged, in the Second Epistle to Timothy, with teaching that the resurrection was already passed, thus undermining the great hope which Christian faith so firmly laid hold of. In the second letter to the Presbyter presiding over the Ephesian congregations the fundamental error was specified on account of which this Hymenæus was excommunicated.<p><span class= "bld">Alexander.</span>—It would be unsafe positively to identify this person with the personal adversary of St. Paul alluded to in the Second Epistle, <a href="/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2Timothy 4:14</a>, there spoken of as “Alexander the coppersmith,” or with the Alexander mentioned in <a href="/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward.

It is a solemn excommunication or expulsion from the Church, accompanied with the infliction of bodily disease or death. In ordinary cases, the offender was quietly expelled from the Christian society. But an Apostle, and only an Apostle, seems to have possessed the awful powers of inflicting bodily suffering in the forms of disease and death. Certain special instances of the exercise of these tremendous powers are recorded in the cases of Ananias and Sapphira, Elymas, the incestuous person at Corinth, and the men here alluded to. The fear of Simon Magus, related in <a href="/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a>, seems to have been aroused by his evident expectation that this well-known apostolic power would be put in force in his case. It is, however, noticeable that this punishment was not necessarily, in the case of disease, an irrevocable sentence. The true end and purpose of this, as of all divine punishments, was not revenge for the sin, but the ultimate recovery of the sinner.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-20 The ministry is a warfare against sin and Satan; carried on under the Lord Jesus, who is the Captain of our salvation. The good hopes others have had of us, should stir us up to duty. And let us be upright in our conduct in all things. The design of the highest censures in the primitive church, was, to prevent further sin, and to reclaim the sinner. May all who are tempted to put away a good conscience, and to abuse the gospel, remember that this is the way to make shipwreck of faith also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander - Hymeneus is nowhere else mentioned in the New Testament, except in <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17</a>, where he is mentioned in connection with Philetus as a very dangerous man. An Alexander is mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>, which some have supposed to be the same as the one referred to here. It is not certain, however, that the same person is intended; see the notes on that verse. In <a href="//biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm">2 Timothy 4:14</a>, Alexander the coppersmith is mentioned as one who had done the apostle "much evil," and there can be little doubt that he is the same person who is referred to here. One of the doctrines which Hymeneus held was, that the "resurrection was past already" <a href="/2_timothy/2-18.htm">2 Timothy 2:18</a>; but what doctrine Alexander held is unknown, It is not improbable, as he is mentioned here in connection with Hymeneus, that he maintained the same opinion, and in addition to that he appears to have been guilty of some personal injury to the apostle. Both also were guilty of blasphemy.<p>Whom I have delivered unto Satan - On the meaning of this expression, see the notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>.<p>That they may learn not to blaspheme - It cannot be supposed that Satan would undertake to teach them not to blaspheme, or that Paul put them under him as an instructor on that subject. The instructions of Satan tend rather to teach his followers to blaspheme, and none in his school fail to be apt scholars. The meaning here is, that Paul excommunicated them, and not improbably brought upon them, by giving them over to Satan, some physical maladies, that they might be reformed; compare notes on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>. It is not entirely clear what is meant by blaspheme in this place; compare notes on <a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>. It cannot be supposed that they were open and bold blasphemers, for such could not have maintained a place in the church, but rather that they held doctrines which the apostle regarded as amounting to blasphemy; that is, doctrines which were in fact a reproach on the divine character. There are many doctrines held by people which are in fact a reflection on the divine character, and which amount to the same thing as blasphemy. A blasphemer openly expresses views of the divine character which are a reproach to God; an errorist expresses the same thing in another way - by teaching as true about God that which represents him in a false light, and, to suppose which, in fact, is a reproach. The spirit with which this is done in the two cases may be different; the thing itself may be the same. Let us be careful that we hold no views about God which are reproachful to him, and which, though we do not express it in words, may lead us to blaspheme him in our hearts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Hymenaeus&#8212;There is no difficulty in supposing him to be the Hymen&aelig;us of 2Ti 2:17. Though "delivered over to Satan" (the lord of all outside the Church, Ac 26:18, and the executor of wrath, when judicially allowed by God, on the disobedient, 1Co 5:5; 2Co 12:7), he probably was restored to the Church subsequently, and again troubled it. Paul, as an apostle, though distant at Rome pronounced the sentence to be executed at Ephesus, involving, probably, the excommunication of the offenders (Mt 18:17, 18). The sentence operated not only spiritually, but also physically, sickness, or some such visitation of God, falling on the person excommunicated, in order to bring him to repentance and salvation. Alexander here is probably "the coppersmith" who did Paul "much evil" when the latter visited Ephesus. The "delivering him to Satan" was probably the consequence of his withstanding the apostle (2Ti 4:14, 15); as the same sentence on Hymen&aelig;us was the consequence of "saying that the resurrection is past already" (2Ti 2:18; his putting away good conscience, naturally producing shipwreck concerning FAITH, 1Ti 1:19. If one's religion better not his morals, his moral deficiencies will corrupt his religion. The rain which falls pure from heaven will not continue pure if it be received in an unclean vessel [Archbishop Whately]). It is possible that he is the Alexander, then a Jew, put forward by the Jews, doubtless against Paul, at the riot in Ephesus (Ac 19:33).<p>that they may&#8212;not "might"; implying that the effect still continues&#8212;the sentence is as yet unremoved.<p>learn&#8212;Greek, "be disciplined," namely, by chastisement and suffering.<p>blaspheme&#8212;the name of God and Christ, by doings and teachings unworthy of their Christian profession (Ro 2:23, 24; Jas 2:7). Though the apostles had the power of excommunication, accompanied with bodily inflictions, miraculously sent (2Co 10:8), it does not follow that fallible ministers now have any power, save that of excluding from church fellowship notorious bad livers.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Of which men who have made shipwreck of a good conscience and concerning faith, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hymenaeus and Alexander</span> are two persons.

Some think by it is signified a peculiar power granted the apostles, God in those primitive times confirming regular excommunications, by letting Satan loose upon persons excommunicated to torture them; but we find nothing of this in Scripture. I rather think the sense is no more than, whom I excommunicated and cast out of the church, making them of the world again, (as the world is opposed to the church, and kingdom of Christ), which, for the greater terror, the apostle expresseth by this notion of being delivered to Satan, who is called <span class="ital">the god of this world, </span>& c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That they may learn not to blaspheme:</span> not that I might ruin and undo them, but that I might amend them by this exercise of discipline, teaching them to take heed of spreading damnable and pernicious errors to the reproach of God.

There is no ground for distinguishing between the Hymenaeus there and the one here mentioned. No difficulty is caused even by the fact that “the one here is mentioned as a man cast out from the church, and the other merely as an example of error” (de Wette); for Hymenaeus and Philetus are not so <span class="ital">tenderly</span> dealt with in the other passages as de Wette seems to think.

The <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία τοῦ Σατανᾶ</span> was “the darkness” over against “the light” of the Kingdom of God (<a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>). The conception is not popular among modern Christians. The two kingdoms, if there are two, have interpenetrated each other. The phraseology, here and in the parallel, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>, is based on <a href="/job/2-6.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand; but save his life.">Job 2:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ παραδίδωμί σοι σὐτόν</span>. The name <span class="greekheb">Σατανᾶς</span> also occurs in chap. <a href="/1_timothy/5-15.htm" title="For some are already turned aside after Satan.">1 Timothy 5:15</a> and in eight other places in the Pauline Epistles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα παιδευθῶσι</span>: The apostolic severity was not merely punitive; it was also corrective. The intention, at least, of excommunication was <span class="greekheb">ἵνα τὸ πνεῦμα σωθῇ</span>, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>. So Chrys. We must not therefore render here, sarcastically, <span class="ital">that they may learn</span>, A.V., but <span class="ital">that they might be taught</span> or <span class="ital">instructed</span>. At the same time, it is unnatural to assume with Bengel that the <span class="greekheb">ταιδεία</span> was intended to keep them from blaspheming at all; St. Paul hoped that it might prevent a repetition of the sin. The term has more of the association of discipline here and in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;">2 Corinthians 6:9</a>, than in the other references.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">βλασφημεῖν</span>: It is absurd to suppose that St. Paul here refers to a railing disparagement of his own apostolic claims.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/1_timothy/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">Hymeneus and Alexander</span>] The name Hymenæus occurs again in <a href="/2_timothy/2-17.htm" title="And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;">2 Timothy 2:17</a>, and being uncommon and used in both places of an heretical person in the same locality may fairly be taken as referring to the same person; the heresy condemned is practically the same; ‘the profane babblings’ there representing the ‘vain talking’ of <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm" title="From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain jangling;">1 Timothy 1:6</a> here, which is plainly echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm" title="Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:">1 Timothy 1:19</a>—the test of orthodoxy being ‘faith and a good conscience.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The name Alexander also occurs again in <a href="/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2 Timothy 4:14</a>; but being common, and having a distinguishing addition there ‘the coppersmith,’ and referring rather to a personal enemy of St Paul than to a heretic, may more probably refer to a different person, possibly the Alexander of <a href="/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33</a>. Fairbairn adds reasonably ‘in the 2nd Epistle Philetus not Alexander is associated with Hymenæus, and Alexander is mentioned alone and apparently as a worker of evil, not at Ephesus but in Rome, though it is possible enough he may have belonged to the region of Asia.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn</span>] The exact force of the tense is <span class="bld">whom I delivered</span>; of the mood, <span class="bld">that they might be disciplined</span>. In the N. T. the later usage holds of the subjunctive following the past tense instead of the optative and our idiom requires ‘might.’ A definite <span class="ital">time</span> and <span class="ital">act</span> of ‘delivering’ is thus seen to be referred to, explained by some ancient and modern commentators as being excommunication; e.g. Theod. Mops., Latin Version, “ecclesiae alienationem ‘traditionem Satanae’ vocans”; by others as the judicial infliction of bodily sickness or calamity, such as the blindness inflicted upon Elymas by St Paul, <a href="/acts/13-11.htm" title="And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.">Acts 13:11</a>; by Ellicott and Fairbairn, as both combined. “The term” says Wordsworth (on <a href="/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>, where the phrase is the same) “appears to have had its origin from consideration of the fact that physical evil is due to the agency of the Evil Spirit; cf. <a href="/job/2-6.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand; but save his life.">Job 2:6</a>; <a href="/luke/13-16.htm" title="And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, see, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?">Luke 13:16</a> : <a href="/context/matthew/8-30.htm" title="And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding....">Matthew 8:30-32</a> (add <a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a> ‘a messenger of Satan’). But St Paul states the aim and end of the sentence of excommunication against the incestuous Corinthian to be that by the punishment of the flesh, and consequent mortification of the fleshly lusts and appetites, ‘his <span class="ital">spirit</span> may be saved in the day of the Lord’; so in the case of Hymenæus and Alexander; and generally his spiritual weapons are given him for edification and not for destruction. Cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">may learn</span>] <span class="bld">might be disciplined</span>; the verb, meaning properly ‘to train,’ ‘educate,’ as in <a href="/acts/7-22.htm" title="And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.">Acts 7:22</a>, is generally used of ‘training by chastisement,’ ‘correcting’; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>, ‘when we are judged we are <span class="ital">chastened</span> of the Lord,’ where the reference is to the sickness and death sent as chastisement for the desecration of the Lord’s Table. Compare the old English use of ‘teach’ in <a href="/judges/8-16.htm" title="And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.">Jdg 8:16</a>, ‘he took the thorns of the wilderness and briars, and with them he <span class="ital">taught</span> the men of Succoth.’ Cf. the striking use in <a href="/luke/23-16.htm" title="I will therefore chastise him, and release him.">Luke 23:16</a>, ‘I will therefore <span class="ital">chastise</span> him and let him go.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1 Timothy 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑμέναιος καὶ Ἀλέξανδρος</span>, <span class="ital">Hymenœus and Alexander</span>) A reproof, with the names expressed: comp. on Hymenæus and Alexander, <a href="/context/2_timothy/2-16.htm" title="But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness....">2 Timothy 2:16-17</a>; <a href="/context/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:...">2 Timothy 4:14-15</a>.—<span class="greekheb">οὓς</span>, <span class="ital">whom</span>) though absent.

Putting these together, it appears that sickness and bodily infirmity and death are, within certain limits, in the power of Satan to inflict. And that the apostles were able, on fitting occasions, to hand over peccant members of the Church to this power of Satan, that by such discipline "the spirit might be saved." In the case of Hymenaeus and Alexander (as in that of the incestuous person at Corinth), the punishment incident on this delivery to Satan would appear to have been short or' death, but in the case of the two first not to have had the effect of bringing them to a true repentance. <span class="cmt_word">Might be taught</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); viz. by correction and punishment, as children are taught (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-8</a>).
