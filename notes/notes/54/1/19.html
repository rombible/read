If a man dares <span class= "ital">to</span> do wilful violence to his better nature he must not presume to dream of <span class= "ital">faith</span> saving him.

The “good conscience” represents the ballast, or cargo, of the ship.

The good hopes others have had of us, should stir us up to duty. And let us be upright in our conduct in all things. The design of the highest censures in the primitive church, was, to prevent further sin, and to reclaim the sinner. May all who are tempted to put away a good conscience, and to abuse the gospel, remember that this is the way to make shipwreck of faith also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Holding faith - Fidelity to the cause in which you are enlisted - as a good soldier should do. This does not mean, as it seems to me, that Timothy should hold to the system of doctrines revealed in the gospel, but that he should have that fidelity which a good soldier should have. He should not betray his trust. He should adhere to the cause of his master with unwavering steadfastness. This would include, of course, a belief of the truth, but this is not the leading idea in the phrase.<p>And a good conscience - see the notes, <a href="/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>. A good conscience, as well as fidelity, is necessary in the service of the Redeemer. A good conscience is that which is well informed in regard to what is right, and where its dictates are honestly followed.<p>Which some having put away - That is, which good conscience some have put from them, or in other words, have not followed its dictates. The truth thus taught is, that people make shipwreck of their faith by not keeping a good conscience. They love sin. They follow the leadings of passion. They choose to indulge in carnal propensities. As a matter of course, they must, if they will do this, reject and renounce the gospel. People become infidels because they wish to indulge in sin. No man can be a sensualist, and yet love that gospel which enjoins purity of life. If people would keep a good conscience, the way to a steady belief in the gospel would be easy. If people will not, they must expect sooner or later to be landed in infidelity.<p>Concerning faith - In respect to the whole subject of faith. They are unfaithful to God, and they reject the whole system of the gospel. "Faith" is sometimes used to denote the gospel - as faith is the principal thing in the gospel.<p>Have made shipwreck - There is an entire destruction of faith - as a ship is wholly ruined that strikes on a rock and sinks. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Holding&#8212;Keeping hold of "faith" and "good conscience" (1Ti 1:5); not "putting the latter away" as "some." Faith is like a very precious liquor; a good conscience is the clean, pure glass that contains it [Bengel]. The loss of good conscience entails the shipwreck of faith. Consciousness of sin (unrepented of and forgiven) kills the germ of faith in man [Wiesinger].<p>which&#8212;Greek singular, namely, "good conscience," not "faith" also; however, the result of putting away good conscience is, one loses faith also.<p>put away&#8212;a wilful act. They thrust it from them as a troublesome monitor. It reluctantly withdraws, extruded by force, when its owner is tired of its importunity, and is resolved to retain his sin at the cost of losing it. One cannot be on friendly terms with it and with sin at one and the same time.<p>made shipwreck&#8212;"with respect to THE faith." Faith is the vessel in which they had professedly embarked, of which "good conscience" is the anchor. The ancient Church often used this image, comparing the course of faith to navigation. The Greek does not imply that one having once had faith makes shipwreck of it, but that they who put away good conscience "make shipwreck with respect to THE faith."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">faith</span> here is meant, the doctrine of faith, and the holding of it signifies a steadiness of the mind’s assent unto it, without wavering or fluctuation, much less deserting or denying it. By <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a good conscience</span> is here to be understood what the Scripture elsewhere calls <span class="ital">a conscience void of of offence toward God, and toward men, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a></span>, opposed to the <span class="ital">evil conscience, </span> mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a></span>; so as a good conscience here signifies a pure conscience, which necessarily implieth a holy life; for our actions are presently copied out into our consciences, and make either blots or good copies there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which some having put away; </span> which some taking no care in, viz. to live holily, so keeping a good conscience; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">concerning faith have made shipwreck; </span> have made shipwreck concerning faith, suffered loss as to it, falling from the truths of the gospel. Error seldom goes along with a holy life. The truths of the gospel have such an influence upon men’s conversation, that ordinarily men’s holiness is proportioned to their soundness in the faith, and usually the love of some lust is what betrayeth men into erroneous judgments and opinions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Holding faith, and a good conscience..... By "faith" is meant, not the grace of faith, but the doctrine of faith, a sense in which it is often used in this epistle; see <a href="/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9</a> and the "holding" of it does not intend a mere profession of it, and a retaining of that without wavering, which is to be done by all believers; but a holding it forth in the ministry of the word, in opposition to a concealing or dropping it, or any part of it; and a holding it fast, without wavering, and in opposition to a departure from it or any cowardice about it and against all posers: to which must be added, a good conscience; the conscience is not naturally good, but is defiled by sin; and that is only good, which is sprinkled by the blood of Christ, and thereby purged from dead works; the effect of which is an holy, upright, and becoming conversation; and which seems to be chiefly intended here, and particularly the upright conduct and behaviour of the ministers of the Gospel, in the faithful discharge of their work and office: see <a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>. <p>Which some having put away; that is, a good conscience; and which does not suppose that they once had one, since that may be put away which was never had: the Jews, who blasphemed and contradicted, and never received the word of God, are said to put it from them, <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a> where the same word is used as here; and signifies to refuse or reject anything with detestation and contempt: these men always had an abhorrence to a good conscience among men, and to a good life and conversation, the evidence of it; and at length threw off the mask, and dropped the faith they professed, as being contrary to their evil conscience: though admitting it does suppose they once had a good conscience, it must be understood not of a conscience cleansed by the blood of Christ, but of a good conscience in external show only, or in comparison of what they afterwards appeared to have: and, besides, some men, destitute of the grace of God, may have a good conscience in some sense, or with respect to some particular facts, or to their general conduct and behaviour among men, as the Apostle Paul had while unregenerate, <a href="/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a> and which being acted against, or lost, is no instance of falling from the true grace of God, which this passage is sometimes produced in proof of: <p>concerning faith have made shipwreck; which designs not the grace, but the doctrine of faith, as before observed, which men may profess, and fall off from, and entirely drop and lose. Though supposing faith as a grace is meant, the phrase, "have made shipwreck of it", is not strong enough to prove the total and final falling away of true believers, could such be thought to be here meant; since persons may be shipwrecked, and not lost, the Apostle Paul was thrice shipwrecked, and each time saved; besides, as there is a true and unfeigned, so there is a feigned and counterfeit faith, which may be in persons who have no true grace, and may be shipwrecked, so as to be lost. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Holding <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> faith, and a good conscience; <span class="cverse3">{16}</span> which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</span><p>(m) Wholesome and sound doctrine.<p>(16) Whoever does not keep a good conscience, loses also by little and little, the gift of understanding.

The manner in which Timothy is to discharge his office, is given still more precisely in the words <span class="greekheb">ἔχων πίστιν καὶ ἀγαθὴν συνείδησιν</span>. It is difficult to bring <span class="greekheb">ἔχων</span> into direct connection with the preceding figure <span class="greekheb">στρατεία</span> (Matthies: “hold fast the faith which elsewhere, in <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>, is called a shield, a weapon of defence in our warfare;” Otto thinks that Paul conceives <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνείδησις</span> as “the contending power which the general commands, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as his troops!”). It is simply “holding, maintaining” (de Wette), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> not denying. The reason for the collocation peculiar to this epistle of <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὴ συνείδησις</span>, and for the strong emphasis laid on the latter idea (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1 Timothy 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;">1 Timothy 4:2</a>, etc.), is, that the apostle regards the denial of the <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνείδ</span>. as the source of the heresy. This is proved by the words that follow, in which Paul returns to the mention of the heretics: <span class="greekheb">ἥν</span> (viz. <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὴν συνείδησιν</span>) <span class="greekheb">τινες</span> (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm" title="From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain jangling;">1 Timothy 1:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπωσάμενοι</span>] This expression, not <span class="ital">strange</span> (de Wette) but suitable, denotes the “wantonness” (de Wette) with which the heretics sacrificed the good conscience to their selfish purposes.[79]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περὶ τὴν πίστιν ἐναυάγησαν</span>] <span class="greekheb">ναυαγεῖν</span> occurs only here in a figurative sense. <span class="greekheb">Περί</span> gives the matter in which they had made shipwreck, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> suffered loss. <span class="greekheb">Περί</span> with the accusative, equivalent to <span class="ital">quod attinet ad</span>, is found in the N.

Hence the important lesson that deviations from the true faith are preceded by violations of the conscience. The surest way to maintain a pure faith is to maintain a good and tender conscience (camp. <a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9</a>; <a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The faith.</span> It is by no means certain that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> here means "the faith" rather than "faith" (subjectire).
