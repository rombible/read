It was never intended to supply materials for casuistry and idle, profitless arguments. It was never meant as a system out of which man might draw material for self-deception. It was never meant as a system through which a man might imagine that by a compliance, more or less rigid, with its outer ritual he was satisfying all the higher requirements of justice and truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/1-8.htm" title="But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;...">1 Timothy 1:8-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">We know that the law is good </span>— Answers excellent purposes; <span class="ital">if a man use it lawfully </span>— In a proper manner.

The apostle’s expression, <span class="ital">If a man use it lawfully, </span>plainly intimates, as Doddridge observes, “that there were some who abused the law, borrowing a pretence from it to condemn some of the best of men, and to subvert the gospel. And whereas some had represented Paul as an enemy to the law, he here denies and disproves the charge. The design of the Mosaic law was to direct the conduct of those to whom it was given, and to humble them under a sense of their sin.

The design of the gospel is answered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believers were righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not against them. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, really repenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law, even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to share the holy happiness of heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But we know that the law is good - We admit this; it is that which we all concede. This declaration is evidently made by the apostle to guard against the supposition that he was an enemy of the law. Doubtless this charge would be brought against him, or against anyone who maintained the sentiments which he had just expressed. By speaking thus of what those teachers regarded as so important in the law, it would be natural for them to declare that he was an enemy of the law itself, and would be glad to see all its claims abrogated. Paul says that he designs no such thing. He admitted that the law was good. He was never disposed for one moment to call it in question. He only asked that it should be rightly understood and properly explained. Paul was never disposed to call in question the excellency and the utility of the law, however it might bear on him or on others; compare  <a href="/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a> note, and <a href="//biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21-26</a> notes.<p>If a man use it lawfully - In a proper manner; for the purposes for which it was designed.

The apostle says this to prevent an objection that might be made to him, that seeing he bore so hard on such who were fond of being teachers of the law, he was himself against the law, and the preaching and proper use of it; but this he would not have concluded, for he and his fellow labourers in the ministry, and all true believers know, from the Scriptures of truth, from the agreement of the law with the Gospel, and from their own experience, that the law is good, provided it be used in a lawful way, and to lawful purposes: and this is to be understood not of the ceremonial law, which was now disannulled, because of the weakness and unprofitableness of it, so that there was no lawful use of that; but of the moral law, which must needs be good, since the author of it is God, who is only good; and nothing but good can come from him: the law, strictly moral, is a copy of his nature, transcribed out of himself, as well as with his own hands; and is a declaration of his will, and is stamped with his authority, and therefore must be good: the matter of it is good, it contains good, yea, great and excellent things; the matter of it is honestly and morally good, as to love mercy, do justice, and walk humbly with God: and it is pleasantly good to a regenerate man, who loves it, and delights in it after the inner man, and serves it with his spirit; though the carnal mind cannot be subject to it, but rejects it, and rebels against it: and it is also profitably good; for though obedience to it is not profitable to God, yet it is to men; and though eternal life is not obtained hereby, nor any reward given for keeping it, yet in keeping it there is a reward; and that peace is enjoyed, which the transgressors of it are strangers to: it is good in the uses of it, both to sinners and to saints. To sinners it is useful for the knowledge of sin, to convince of it, and bring them to a sense of it, and concern for it, which is effectually done, when the Spirit of God sets in with it, or brings this commandment home to the heart; and if it has not this use, it is sometimes a means of restraining men from sin, which is the use of civil laws among men; and if it has not this, it is of use however to accuse men rightly of sin, and to pronounce justly guilty before God for it, to curse them as they deserve it, and to sentence to condemnation and death: and to believers it is of use, though they are not under it as in the hands of Moses, and as a covenant of works, and are freed from its curse and condemnation, and under no obligation to seek for life and righteousness by it; to them it is of use, to point out to them what is the will of God, and what should be done, and not done; and it is a rule of walk and conversation to them, as in the hands of Christ; and is as a glass to them to behold their own deformity, the impurity of their nature, the plague of their own hearts, and the imperfection of their obedience; by which they see the insufficiency of their own righteousness, how far they are from perfection, and what carnal creatures they are, when compared with this law: and as this serves to put them out of conceit with themselves, so it tends to make Christ and his righteousness more lovely and valuable in their esteem; who has wrought out a righteousness as broad and as long as the law is, and by which it is magnified and made honourable, and has delivered them from its curse and condemnation. And this law is good as it is holy, in its author, nature, and use; and as it is just, requiring just things, and doing that which is just, by acquitting those who are interested in Christ's righteousness, and in condemning those that have no righteousness; and as it is a spiritual and perfect law, which reaches the spirit and soul of man, and is concerned with inward thoughts and motions, as well as outward actions; and especially the end of it, the fulfilling end of it is good, which is Jesus Christ, who was made under it, came to fulfil it, and has answered all the demands of it: so that it must be good, and which cannot be denied, <p>if a man use it lawfully; for if it is used in order to obtain life, righteousness, and salvation by the works of it, or by obedience to it, it is used unlawfully: for the law does not give life, nor can righteousness come by it; nor are, or can men be saved by the works of it; to use the law for such purposes, is to abuse it, as the false teachers did, and make that which is good in itself, and in its proper use, to do what is evil; namely, to obscure and frustrate the grace of God, and make null and void the sufferings and death of Christ. A lawful use of the law is to obey it, as in the hands of Christ, the King of saints, and lawgiver in his church, from a principle of love to him, in the exercise of faith on him, without any mercenary selfish views, without trusting to, or depending on, what is done in obedience to it, but with a view to the glory of God, to testify our subjection to Christ, and our gratitude to him for favours received from him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> But we know that the law <i>is</i> good, if a man use it lawfully;</span><p>(7) The taking away of an objection: he does not condemn the Law, but requires the right use and practice of it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/1-8.htm" title="But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;">1 Timothy 1:8</a>. In contrast with the heretics’ advocacy of the law, the apostle, in what follows, states its real value.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Οἴδαμεν δὲ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Baur wrongly infers from these words that the heretics, as Antinomians, had no desire to vindicate the law as good. It is not these first words, but the words <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., that are directed against the heretics. In spite of Hofmann’s denial, <span class="greekheb">οἴδαμεν δέ</span> stands in a concessive sense, (Wiesinger), as in <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>, the apostle making an acknowledgment which is restricted by <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; still we cannot translate it simply by <span class="ital">concedimus</span>, as Heinrichs does.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καλὸς ὁ νόμος</span>] By <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> we must understand, neither the Christian moral law, nor a single part of the Mosaic law, but the latter as a whole. It is of the entire Mosaic law in its existing form as a revelation of the divine will given in a system of written commands—it is of this that Paul uses <span class="greekheb">καλός</span> as a suitable epithet. It is not enough to take <span class="greekheb">καλός</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ὠφέλιμος</span> (Theodoret), though the idea of usefulness is included in it; <span class="greekheb">καλός</span> denotes generally the internal excellence of the law, just as the same is set forth in still more significant expressions in <a href="/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>; <a href="/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a>. But the good and excellent qualities of the law depend on its being applied according to its nature and signification: when applied otherwise, it ceases to be <span class="greekheb">καλός</span>. Hence Paul, in opposition to the heretics, adds: <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις αὐτῷ νομίμως χρῆται</span>. The <span class="greekheb">νομίμως</span>, which is clearly a play on words with <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span>, only expresses the formal relation; we can only infer from the thoughts that follow what is meant by the <span class="ital">lawful</span> use of law.[57] De Wette rightly remarks: “There is in this passage nothing but what the words really say, that the Christian teacher must not uphold the law as binding on the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span>.” While nearly all expositors understand by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙς</span></span></span> the Christian as such, Bengel remarks: Paulus hoc loco non de auditore legis, sed de doctore loquitur; in this he is right, as is acknowledged also by de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Hofmann. Paul says nothing here as to how the law is to be obeyed, but rather he tells us how it is to be made use of by Christian teachers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] Most expositors have on this passage told us wherein consisted the material advantage of the law; but however correct their statements in themselves may be, they are out of place, since there is no ground for them in the apostle’s words.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/context/1_timothy/1-8.htm" title="But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;...">1 Timothy 1:8-11</a>.
