The Greek word translated “was exceeding abundant” is very rare, and possesses a superlative force.<p><span class= "bld">With faith and love.</span>—He sums up the divine mercy showed to him in the three words: grace, faith, and love. Grace, the unspeakable gift of God to him; faith and love, the results of the exceeding abundant gift of grace.<p>Faith: not merely a childlike trust in Christ, but a belief which accepted Christ as the hope of an otherwise hopeless world; and love, which includes love to man as well as love to God, a strange contrast to his former cruelty and hatred; for, instead of blaspheming, <span class= "ital">now</span> he believed on Him whom he once reviled, and instead of persecuting the followers of Jesus, <span class= "ital">now, </span>in his great love for them, he spent himself. Then, overwhelmed with joy and thankfulness that he, the enemy of God, had obtained the mercy and love of God, and conscious, from his own sweet and bitter experiences, what that mercy of God bestowed on a sinner signified, he gave utterance to one of those bright watchwords of the faith, with which the Christians of the first days used to comfort and encourage one another, and which, perhaps, better than any other words, gave expression to the burning thoughts which rose up from his grateful heart.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-17 The apostle knew that he would justly have perished, if the Lord had been extreme to mark what was amiss; and also if his grace and mercy had not been abundant to him when dead in sin, working faith and love to Christ in his heart. This is a faithful saying; these are true and faithful words, which may be depended on, That the Son of God came into the world, willingly and purposely to save sinners. No man, with Paul's example before him, can question the love and power of Christ to save him, if he really desires to trust in him as the Son of God, who once died on the cross, and now reigns upon the throne of glory, to save all that come to God through him.

And these graces were from Christ, the fruits of his merit, and Holy Spirit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant,.... That is, the love of Jehovah the Father; so the Ethiopic version reads, "the grace of God"; of God the Father, since he is distinguished in the text from Jesus Christ. God is abundant in grace and goodness; he is rich and plenteous in mercy; there is an overflow of love in his heart to his chosen people, and in conversion it flows out, and abounds and superabounds; see <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>. <p>with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus; these are the effects of the love and favour of God displayed in conversion, or which the grace of God brings along with it, and implants in the soul at that time, as it did in the apostle; for by "faith" is not meant the faithfulness of God to his Son, and to his covenant, oath, and promise, which now began visibly to be made good; nor the faith of the Gospel committed to the apostle's trust, which was an high favour; but the grace of faith, which is a pure gift of God, and a distinguishing instance of his grace; for all men have it not, only his elect; and is a most precious and excellent grace, and of great use and importance: it receives every blessing from Christ, and gives him all the glory; through it much peace, joy, and comfort are enjoyed here, and with it is connected eternal life and salvation hereafter: and by "love" also is meant, not the love with which God loves his people, for that is designed by the grace of our Lord, though there is a very great display of that in conversion, which is a time of love; but the internal grace of love, even love to God, to Christ, and to his people, which the apostle was before destitute of; but now instead of unbelief he had faith, and instead of rage and madness against Christ, and the saints, his soul was filled with love to both. The Arabic version reads, "with my faith, and my love". The phrase, "which is in Christ Jesus", denotes either that the spring of these graces is in Christ, and that they come from him, in whom all fulness dwells; or that he is the object of them, in which they centre, and on whom they are exercised, and particularly that love to the saints was shown for his sake. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant <span class="cverse3">{12}</span> with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span><p>(12) He proves this change by the effects, because he who was a profane man, has become a believer: and he that did most outrageously persecute Christ, burns now in love towards him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/1-14.htm" title="And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">1 Timothy 1:14</a>. The last words might be so explained as to weaken seemingly the divine grace; and therefore the apostle feels bound to set forth its abundant riches.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπερεπλεόνασε δὲ ἡ χάρις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] The verb <span class="greekheb">ὑπερπλεονάζειν</span> only occurs here in the N. T., and is not current in classical Greek. The simple <span class="greekheb">πλεονάζειν</span>, with the classic writers, means: “to be more, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> than the measure demands, therefore to go beyond the measure;” but in several passages of the N. T. it has clearly the meaning: “<span class="ital">become</span> more, therefore increase, grow larger.” Comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a> (synon. with <span class="greekheb">ὑπεραυξάνειν</span>); <a href="/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a> (Meyer: accumulate); so also <a href="/philippians/4-17.htm" title="Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.">Php 4:17</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.">2 Corinthians 4:15</a> (Meyer has there: “<span class="ital">become</span> abundant … increase,” and here: “be increased”). The prefix <span class="greekheb">ὑπερ</span> serves, with Paul, to strengthen the idea with which it is joined; thus <span class="greekheb">ὑπεραυξάνει</span>, <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεκπερισσοῦ</span>, <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm" title="Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,">Ephesians 3:20</a>; <span class="greekheb">ὑπερλίαν</span>, <a href="/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>, <span class="ital">al</span>. In <a href="/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεπερίσσευσεν</span> seems to mean that the <span class="greekheb">ἐπλεόνασεν ἡ ἁμαρτία</span> was surpassed by the <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> (so Meyer; Hofmann differs). If we assume here this reference of surpassing, we cannot regard <span class="greekheb">ἠλεήθην</span> as the thing surpassed. For <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> cannot be regarded as something surpassing <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span>;[66] but <span class="greekheb">ὑπερ</span> in that case would have to be referred to <span class="greekheb">τὸ πρότερον ὄντα βλάσφημον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Hence the apostle’s meaning in <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεπλεόνασεν</span> would be that grace was manifested to him in abundant measure, far surpassing his enmity (so in a former edition of this commentary); but in that case <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ ἠλεήθην κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. would be parenthetical. It is more correct not to assume such a reference here, but to explain <span class="greekheb">ὑπερπλεονάζειν</span>: “to go (abundantly) beyond the measure” (Plitt, van Oosterzee, Hofmann). The apostle added <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεπλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἠλεήθην</span>, because the latter expression did not seem enough to his mind, which was penetrated by the unbounded greatness of the grace he had experienced. “It is as though he wrestles with speech in order to find some sufficient expression for the feeling which quite overpowers him” (van Oosterzee). The particle <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> belongs to the relation of climax existing between the two clauses, as in <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm" title="For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and whips every son whom he receives.">Hebrews 12:6</a>; it corresponds to the English <span class="ital">yea</span> or <span class="ital">aye</span> in a climax.[67]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΤᾺ ΠΊΣΤΕΩς ΚΑῚ ἈΓΆΠΗς</span></span></span>] The preposition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΤΆ</span></span></span> with the genitive serves to connect the fact with the points that accompany it. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΙς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΆΠΗ</span></span></span> therefore are, properly speaking, not mentioned as results of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΆΡΙς</span></span></span>, but as blessings immediately connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΆΡΙς</span></span></span>. They form, as de Wette says, the subjective side of the condition of grace. Leo is right, therefore, in saying: “verbis <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΤᾺ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> indicatur, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Π</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> quasi comites fuisse illius <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΆΡΙΤΟς</span></span></span>” (so also Plitt and van Oosterzee); but he is wrong, if he means that Paul added these words to tell in what the grace was manifested as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΕΡΠΛΕΟΝΆΖΟΥΣΑ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΙς Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡ ἘΝ ΧΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> we are not to understand God’s faithfulness and love in Christ, nor the apostle’s endeavour to bring others to faith and love; nor, again, is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> to be explained by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΆ</span></span></span> or by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> The words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ἘΝ ΧΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> are added to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ἈΓΆΠΗς</span></span></span>, and mark the love as one “that has its ground and middle-point in Christ” (Matthies); cf. <a href="/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 1:13</a>. It is doubtful whether the addition is to be referred also to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΕΩς</span></span></span> (for this Matthies, Plitt, van Oosterzee; against it, Hofmann); since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΕΩς</span></span></span> does not properly require it, it might be better to limit the reference to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΆΠΗς</span></span></span>.[68] “In contrasting his former <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΙΣΤΊΑ</span></span></span> with his present increasing <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΣΤΙς Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓ</span></span></span>.” (Heydenreich), Paul does not lose sight of the heresy which did not effect <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἸΚΟΝΟΜΊΑ ΘΕΟῦ ἘΝ ΠΊΣΤΕΙ</span></span></span> (<a href="/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1 Timothy 1:4</a>), and had not the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΓΆΠΗ</span></span></span> (<a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1 Timothy 1:5</a>) as its goal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[66] Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐτιμωρήθην</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἠλεήθην γὰρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρʼ οὖν τοῦτο μόνον</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ μέχρι τούτου ὁ ἔλεος</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι τιμωρίαν</span>; <span class="greekheb">οὐδαμῶς</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ ἕτερα πολλὰ καὶ μεγάλα</span>, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο φησίν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεπλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις</span>, <span class="greekheb">δηλῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ὑπερέβη καὶ τὸν ἔλεον τὰ δῶρα</span>· <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα γὰρ οὐκ ἐλεοῦντός ἐστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ φιλοῦντος καὶ σφόδρα ἀγαπῶντος</span>.

In this view the force of <span class="greekheb">ἠλεήθην</span> is arbitrarily weakened.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[67] Hofmann explains <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> as ranking another fact with the one already mentioned; but in <span class="greekheb">ἠλεήθην</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὑπερεπλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις</span> we have not two different facts, but one and the same fact—though expressed in two different ways.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[68] Hofmann alleges against the connection with <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>, that “<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> would have a different meaning when joined with <span class="greekheb">πίστεως</span>; according to <a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>;” but his reason is without force, as this other reference is here cut off by the intervening <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπης</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/1-14.htm" title="And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">1 Timothy 1:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπερπλεονάζειν</span> only occurs here in N.T.; but St. Paul constantly uses compounds with <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>.
