they would thus, in the long run, instead of benefiting, positively injure the cause of Christ. St. Paul’s practical mind, guided by the Spirit of God, has left us no impossible rules of perfection, no exaggerated praises of asceticism, of lofty self-denial, no passionate exhortings to a life made up entirely of self-sacrifice and of self-surrender.<p>He knew the ordinary man or woman was incapable of such exalted heroism, and therefore was too wise, too loving, even to recommend a life which few could live. It was not that the Master, Christ, and the greatest of his servants, St. Paul, did not themselves prize and admire the higher ideal and the nobler life—for was it not their own? Did not one attain to it, and the other die in his hero-efforts to reach it? But Master and scholar in their gospel of the world have left commands that all, not the few, can obey—have enjoined a life which all, not the few, may live.<p><span class= "bld">Give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</span>—The reference here is not to the devil—as would at first appear probable from the direct reference in the next verse—but to the enemy of Christ—the sneering worldly man, who, jealous of a faith which he declines to receive, and envious of a life in which he will not share, is always on the look-out to discover flaws and failings in the avowed professors of a religion which he hates.

From this command it is evident, that under the gospel second marriages are lawful both to men and women, and that abstaining from them is no mark of superior piety. It is true the apostle, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, advised all who had the gift of continency to remain unmarried; not, however, because celibacy is a more holy state than marriage, but because in the then persecuted state of the church, a single life was more free from trouble and temptation.

Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will therefore - I give it as my opinion; or this is my counsel; compare notes, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>.<p>That the younger women marry - The word "women" is not expressed or necessarily implied in the original - neooteras -  - and it is evident that the apostle here had particular reference to "widows," and that the injunction should be understood as relating to them. We are not to suppose that he gives this as an absolute and universal command, for it might not always be at the option of the widow to marry again, and it cannot be doubted that there may be cases where it would be unadvisable. But he speaks of this as a general rule. It is better for such persons to have domestic concerns that require their attention, than it is to be exposed to the evils of an idle life. We may learn from this:<p>(1) that second marriages are not improper or unlawful, but that in some circumstances they may be preferable to widowhood;<p>(2) that marriage itself is in a high degree honorable. How different are the views of the inspired apostle Paul about marriage from those of the Papists!<p>Bear children, guide the house - These words signify, says Bloomfield, to "exercise and occupy themselves in the duties of a wife." It is better to be employed in the duties growing out of the cares of a family, than to lead a life of celibacy.<p>Give none occasion to the adversary - The enemy of religion - the pagan or the infidel.<p>To speak reproachfully - Margin, "for their railing." That is, on account of a life which would do no honor to religion. In the performance of domestic duties, when fully employed, they would avoid the evils specified in <a href="/1_timothy/5-13.htm">1 Timothy 5:13</a>. Every one who professes religion should so live as to give no occasion to an infidel or a man of the world to speak reproachfully of the cause of the Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. younger women&#8212;rather, as ellipsis ought to be supplied, "the younger widows," namely younger widows in general, as distinguished from the older widows taken on the roll of presbyteresses (1Ti 5:9). The "therefore" means seeing that young widows are exposed to such temptations, "I will," or "desire," &c. (1Ti 5:11-13). The precept here that they should marry again is not inconsistent with 1Co 7:40; for the circumstances of the two cases were distinct (compare 1Co 7:26). Here remarriage is recommended as an antidote to sexual passion, idleness, and the other evils noted in 1Ti 5:11-13. Of course, where there was no tendency to these evils, marriage again would not be so requisite; Paul speaks of what is generally desirable, and supposing there should be danger of such evils, as was likely.

Hofmann is wrong, however, in asserting that <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σατανᾶ</span> in <a href="/1_timothy/5-15.htm" title="For some are already turned aside after Satan.">1 Timothy 5:15</a> is decisive against the first explanation, for <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> would have been used.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>De Wette joins the last part of the clause to what precedes, in such a way as to supply: “and in this way.” But there is no hint of this limitation.

Then those who marry “in the Lord” again will find scope for an active irreproachable Christian life; while,’ as he said before, ‘those who have been misled, in their trouble, by the world and the flesh, and seek a worldly heathen re-marriage, will not compromise the Church by having had a place on the roll of godly almswomen.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bear children, guide the house</span>] Compound verbs again, as in <a href="/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1 Timothy 5:10</a>, used only here in N.

And this arrangement (mode of acting), which the apostle mentions, equally applies to the unmarried and to widows under sixty years.

The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> which precedes is a further proof that this direction or command of the apostle's springs from what he had just been saying about the young widows, and therefore that what follows relates to them, and not to women generally. In order to avoid the scandal mentioned in ver. 11 of the young widows first dedicating their widowhood to Christ, and then drawing back and marrying, he directs that they should follow the natural course and marry, in doing which they would be blameless. <span class="cmt_word">Bear children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>): here only in the New Testament or LXX.; but <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs in <a href="/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a> (where see note). <span class="cmt_word">Rule the household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>; here only in this sense); act the part of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, the mistress of a family (Plutarch and elsewhere). <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> frequent in the New Testament, and kindred words are used in classical Greek. <span class="cmt_word">For reviling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>).

Any misconduct on the part of Christian widows would give him the occasion he was looking for. They must be doubly careful, therefore, lest they should bring reproach upon the Name of Christ (camp. <a href="/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4, 14, 15</a>).
