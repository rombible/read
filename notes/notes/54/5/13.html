and this the Apostle seems to have feared would be the result of these visits, and the fruit of their work, if the younger sisters were enrolled in the official list, for he speaks of such becoming “not only idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies, speaking things which they ought not.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And withal - In addition to the prospect that they may marry again, there are other disadvantages which might follow from such an arrangement, and other evils to be feared which it is desirable to avoid.<p>They learn to be idle - That is, if supported by the church, and if without the settled principles which might be expected in those more aged and experienced, it may be feared that they will give themselves up to an indolent life. There would be a security in the age and established habits of these more advanced in life, which there could not be in their case. The apostle does not mean that widows are naturally disposed to be idle, but that in the situation referred to there would be danger of it.<p>Wandering about from house to house - A natural consequence of supposing that they had nothing to do, and a practice not only profitless, but always attended with mischief.<p>Tattlers also - Literally, "overflowing;" then overflowing with talk; praters, triflers. They would learn all the news; become acquainted with the secrets of families, and of course indulge in much idle and improper conversation. Our word "gossipers" would accurately express the meaning here. The noun does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. The verb occurs in <a href="/john/3-10.htm">John 3:10</a>; rendered, "prating against."<p>And busy-bodies - see the notes on <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11</a>. The word means, probably, "working all round, overdoing," and then "an intermeddler." Persons who have nothing to do of their own, commonly find employment by interesting themselves in the affairs of their neighbors. No one likes to be wholly idle, and if anyone is not found doing what he ought to do, he will commonly be found engaged in doing what he ought not.<p>Speaking things which they ought not - Revealing the concerns of their neighbors; disclosing secrets; magnifying trifles, so as to exalt themselves into importance, as if they were entrusted with the secrets of others; inventing stories and tales of gossip, that they may magnify and maintain their own consequence in the community. No persons are commonly more dangerous to the peace of a neighborhood than those who have nothing to do. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. withal&#8212;"at the same time, moreover."<p>learn&#8212;usually in a good sense.

Being at ease, and without labour, living at the expense of the church: "wandering about from house to house"; having nothing else to do: such an one is what the Jews (z) call , "the gadding widow"; who, as the gloss says, <p>"goes about and visits her neighbours continually; and these are they that corrupt the world.'' <p>Of this sort of women must the Jews be understood, when they say (a), it is one of the properties of them to be "going out", or gadding abroad, as Dinah did; and that it is another to be   "talkative", which agrees with what follows: <p>and not only idle, but tattlers also; full of talk, who have always some news to tell, or report to make of the affairs of this, or the other person, or family: <p>and busy bodies; in the matters of other persons, which do not concern them: <p>speaking things which they ought not; which either are not true, and, if they are, are not to be spoken of, and carried from place to place: this is a very great inconvenience, the apostle observes, arising from the admission of such young widows to be relieved and maintained at the church's charge. <p>(z) T.

But <span class="greekheb">μανθάνειν</span> with the partic. does not mean <span class="ital">learn</span>; it is “<span class="ital">observe, perceive, remark</span>;” <span class="greekheb">μανθάνειν</span>, in the sense of <span class="ital">learn</span> (“accustom oneself”), has always the infinitive (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>). Leo therefore takes it here as “be wont to;” but this sense only occurs in the preterite. Winer (pp. 325 f. [E. T. p. 436]) thinks it probable that <span class="greekheb">ἀργαὶ μανθάνουσι</span> are to be taken together, “<span class="ital">they learn idleness</span>” (or “they learn to be lazy;” so in the second edition of this commentary; so, too, Hofmann). It is in favour of this construction that the chief emphasis is laid on <span class="greekheb">ἀργαί</span>; but no passage can be found confirming it.[184] Besides, the position of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΡΓΑΊ</span></span></span> shows that it belongs to the subject. Bengel had taken refuge in supplying something explaining it: discunt quae domos obeundo discuntur, i. e statum familiarum curiose explorant. Buttmann (pp. 260 f.) agrees with this explanation, only that he regards the supplied words: statum, etc., as too arbitrary and sweeping; he observes: “what they learn <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΕΡΧΌΜΕΝΑΙ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΟἸΚ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is sufficiently indicated, not indeed grammatically, but in sense, by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΡΓΑΊ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΦΛΥΑΡΟΊ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΕΡΙΈΡΓΟΙ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΛΑΛΟῦΣΑΙ ΤᾺ ΜῊ ΔΈΟΝΤΑ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>” But if, as Buttmann thinks, we are to assume here an anacolouthon, it would be more natural to find the hint of what is to be supplied in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΕΡΧΌΜΕΝΑΙ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΟἸΚ</span></span></span>., so that the meaning would be: they learn <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΕΡΧΌΜΕΝΑΙ</span></span></span> this very <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΈΡΧΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the construction <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΕΡΧΌΜΕΝΑΙ ΤᾺς ΟἸΚΊΑς</span></span></span>, comp. <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm" title="And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.">Matthew 4:23</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙῆΓΕΝ ὍΛΗΝ ΤῊΝ ΓΑΛΙΛΑΊΑΝ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Οὐ ΜΌΝΟΝ ΔῈ ἈΡΓΑῚ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΛᾺ ΚΑῚ ΦΛΎΑΡΟΙ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">ΦΛΎΑΡΟΙ</span></span></span>, “talkative” (Luther), only occurs here; the verb <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΛΥΑΡΈΩ</span></span></span> in <a href="/3_john/1-10.htm" title="Why, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.">3 John 1:10</a>.

It is not improbable that there were definite instances, and these caused the apostle to speak in this general way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[184] Winer, indeed, quotes two passages, one from Plato, <span class="ital">Euthyd.</span> 276<span class="ital">b:</span> <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀμαθεῖς ἄρα σοφοὶ μανθάνουσι</span>, and the other from Dio Chr. 55. 558: <span class="greekheb">ὁ Σωκράτης ὅτι μὲν παῖς ὢν ἐμάνθανε λιθοξόος τὴν τοῦ πατρὸς τέχνην</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀκηκόαμεν</span>. Buttmann remarks on the first, that the addition <span class="greekheb">σοφοί</span> (which is quite meaningless) is rejected on MS. authority, and on the other that it is of quite a different nature. In both, cases he is clearly right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/5-13.htm" title="And with they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.">1 Timothy 5:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἅμα δὲ καί</span> is Pauline.

Chrys. lv. 558, Field notes, “Although the reading in Plato may be doubtful, there is no doubt of the agreement of St. Paul’s construction with <span class="ital">later</span> usage”. Field adds two from St. Chrysostom T. vii. p. 699 <span class="ital">a</span>: <span class="greekheb">τί οὖν</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἂν παλαιστὴς μανθάνῃς</span>; T. ix. p. 259 <span class="ital">b</span>: <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἰατρὸς μέλλοις μανθάνειν</span>. He notes that the correlative phraseology, <span class="greekheb">διδάξαι</span> (or <span class="greekheb">διδάξασθαι</span>) <span class="greekheb">τινὰ τεκτόνα</span>, <span class="greekheb">χαλκέα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἱππέα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ῥήτορα</span>, is to be found in the best writers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is impossible to connect <span class="greekheb">μανθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">περιερχ</span>. as Vulg., <span class="ital">discunt circuire domos</span>; for, as Alf. says, “<span class="greekheb">μανθάνω</span> with a participle always means <span class="ital">to be aware of, take notice of</span>, the act implied in the verb”. Here, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the meaning would be “they learn that they are going about,” which is absurd. Bengel’s view, that <span class="greekheb">μανθάνουσι</span> is to be taken absolutely, is equally impossible: “being idle, they are learners,” the nature of the things they learn to be inferred from the way they spend their time.
