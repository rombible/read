Then, in those early days, as now, men and women were attempting to persuade themselves that the hopes and promises of Christians could be attained and won by a mere profession of faith, by an assent to the historical truths, by a barren reception of the doctrine of the atonement, without any practice of stern self-denial, apart from any loving consideration for others; there were evidently in that great Church of Ephesus, which St. Paul knew so well not a few professed believers in the Crucified who, while possessed themselves of a competence, perhaps even of wealth, could calmly look on while their relations and friends languished in the deepest poverty.<p><span class= "bld">And specially for those of his own house.</span>—The circle of those for whose support and sustenance a Christian was responsible is here enlarged: not merely is the fairly prosperous man who professes to love Christ, bound to do his best for his nearest relations, such as his mother and grandmother, but St. Paul says “he must assist those of his own house,” in which term relatives who are much more distant are included, and even dependents connected with the family who had fallen into poverty and distress.<p><span class= "bld">He hath denied the faith.</span>—Faith, considered as a rule of life, is practically denied by one who neglects these kindly duties and responsibilities, for “faith worketh by love” (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>). Faith here is considered by St. Paul, not as mere belief in the doctrine, or even in a person, but as a rule of life.<p><span class= "bld">And is worse than an infidel.</span>—The rules even of the nobler Pagan moralists forbid such heartless selfishness. For a Christian, then, deliberately to neglect such plain duties would bring shame and disgrace on the religion of the loving Christ, and, notwithstanding the name he bore, and the company in which he was enrolled, such a denier of the faith would be really worse than a heathen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">If any provide not </span>— Food and raiment; <span class="ital">for his own </span>— Poor relations; <span class="ital">and especially those of his own house </span>— <span class="greekheb">Των οικειων</span>, <span class="ital">his own domestics, </span>those relations who live in his own family, and consequently are under his eye; <span class="ital">he hath denied the faith </span>— Namely, by such a practice, which is utterly inconsistent with Christianity, which does not destroy, but perfects natural duties.

It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to believe the doctrines of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if any provide not for his own - The apostle was speaking <a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm">1 Timothy 5:4</a> particularly of the duty of children toward a widowed mother. In enforcing that duty, he gives the subject, as he often does in similar cases, a general direction, and says that all ought to provide for those who were dependent on them, and that if they did not do this, they had a less impressive sense of the obligations of duty than even the pagan had. On the duty here referred to, compare <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a> note; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a> note. The meaning is, that the person referred to is to think beforehand (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;  pronoei) of the probable needs of his own family, and make arrangements to meet them. God thus provides for our needs; that is, he sees beforehand what we shall need, and makes arrangements for those needs by long preparation. The food that we eat, and the raiment that we wear, he foresaw that we should need, and the arrangement for the supply was made years since, and to meet these needs he has been carrying forward the plans of his providence in the seasons; in the growth of animals; in the formation of fruit; in the bountiful harvest. So, according to our measure, we are to anticipate what will be the probable needs of our families, and to make arrangements to meet them. The words "his own," refer to those who are naturally dependent on him, whether living in his own immediate family or not. There may be many distant relatives naturally dependent on our aid, besides those who live in our own house.<p>And specially for those of his own house - Margin, "kindred." The word "house," or "household," better expresses the sense than the word "kindred." The meaning is, those who live in his own family. They would naturally have higher claims on him than those who did not. They would commonly be his nearer relatives, and the fact, from whatever cause, that they constituted his own family, would lay the foundation for a strong claim upon him. He who neglected his own immediate family would be more guilty than he who neglected a more remote relative.<p>He hath denied the faith - By his conduct, perhaps, not openly. He may be still a professor of religion and do this; but he will show that he is imbued with none of the spirit of religion, and is a stranger to its real nature. The meaning is, that he would, by such an act, have practically renounced Christianity, since it enjoins this duty on all. We may hence learn that it is possible to deny the faith by conduct as well as by words; and that a neglect of doing our duty is as real a denial of Christianity as it would be openly to renounce it. Peter denied his Lord in one way, and thousands do the same thing in another. He did it in words; they by neglecting their duty to their families, or their duty in their closets, or their duty in attempting to send salvation to their fellow-men, or by an openly irreligious life. A neglect of any duty is so far a denial of the faith.<p>And is worse than an infidel - The word here does not mean an infidel, technically so called, or one who openly professes to disbelieve Christianity, but anyone who does not believe; that is, anyone who is not a sincere Christian. The word, therefore, would include the pagan, and it is to them, doubtless, that the apostle particularly refers. They acknowledged the obligation to provide for their relatives. This was one of the great laws of nature written on their hearts, and a law which they felt bound to obey. Few things were inculcated more constantly by pagan moralists than this duty. Gelgacus, in Tacitus, says, "Nature dictates that to every one, his own children and relatives should be most dear." Cicero says, "Every man should take care of his own family " - suos quisque debet tueri; see Rosenmuller, in loc., and also numerous examples of the same kind quoted from Apuleius, Cicero, Plutarch, Homer, Terence, Virgil, and Servius, in Pricaeus, in loc. The doctrine here is:<p>(1) that a Christian ought not to be inferior to an unbeliever in respect to any virtue;<p>(2) that in all that constitutes true virtue he ought to surpass him;<p>(3) that the duties which are taught by nature ought to be regarded as the more sacred and obligatory from the fact that God has given us a better religion; and,<p>(4) that a Christian ought never to give occasion to an enemy of the gospel to point to a man of the world and say, "there is one who surpasses you in any virtue." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. But&#8212;reverting to 1Ti 5:4, "If any (a general proposition; therefore including in its application the widow's children or grandchildren) provide not for his own (relations in general), and especially for those of his own house (in particular), he hath (practically) denied the faith." Faith without love and its works is dead; "for the subject matter of faith is not mere opinion, but the grace and truth of God, to which he that believes gives up his spirit, as he that loves gives up his heart" [Mack]. If in any case a duty of love is plain, it is in relation to one's own relatives; to fail in so plain an obligation is a plain proof of want of love, and therefore of want of faith. "Faith does not set aside natural duties, but strengthens them" [Bengel].<p>worse than an infidel&#8212;because even an infidel (or unbeliever) is taught by nature to provide for his own relatives, and generally recognizes the duty; the Christian who does not so, is worse (Mt 5:46, 47).

The daughter of Cimon gave her ancient father the breast, and suckled him when in prison.

The Jews (w) have a rule or canon, which obliged men to take care of their families, which runs thus: <p>"as a man is bound to provide for his wife, so he is hound to provide for his sons and daughters, the little ones, until they are six years old; and from thenceforward he gives them food till they are grown up, according to the order of the wise men; if he will not, they reprove him, and make him ashamed, and oblige him; yea, if he will not, they publish him in the congregation, and say such an one is cruel, and will not provide for his children; and lo, he is worse than an unclean fowl, which feeds her young.'' <p>(w) Maimon.

In the N. T., as a rule, <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἴδιοι</span> are those in close fellowship and community with another. For instance, in <a href="/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a> the relation of Christ to His disciples is thus named. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ ἴδιοι</span> is here wider in meaning than <span class="greekheb">οἱ οἰκεῖοι</span>, which is “those properly of the household.” Hofmann thinks that, if the reading without the article be adopted, <span class="greekheb">μάλιστα</span> does not belong to the verb, but to <span class="greekheb">οἰκείων</span> = <span class="greekheb">οἰκειοτάτων</span>. It is well known that in classic Greek the superlative is sometimes expressed by <span class="greekheb">μάλιστα</span> before the positive. But this usage is never found in the N. T.; and besides, here, where <span class="greekheb">οἰκεῖος</span> refers to <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον</span> (<a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>), and is therefore equivalent to “member of the household or family,” the superlative <span class="greekheb">οἰκείοτατος</span> is meaningless. To paraphrase it into “nearest kinsman of all” is purely arbitrary. At any rate, the article is by no means necessary before <span class="greekheb">οἰκείων</span>, since the <span class="greekheb">ἴδιοι</span> and the <span class="greekheb">οἰκεῖοι</span> belong to <span class="ital">one</span> class; the intervening <span class="greekheb">μάλιστα</span> makes no difference, although it lays special emphasis on the latter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται</span>] inasmuch as he does not do that to which faith, if it be a living faith, incites him; fides enim non tollit officia naturalia, sed perficit et firmat, Bengel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔστιν ἀπίστου χείρων</span>] <span class="greekheb">Ἄπιστος</span> here is not (as at <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="/titus/1-15.htm" title="To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.">Titus 1:15</a>) “an enemy of Christ,” but “one who is not a Christian,” one who as such is incited by natural law to love his own children (comp. <a href="/context/matthew/5-46.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same?...">Matthew 5:46-47</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Calvin says on this: quod duabus de causis verum est, nam quo plus quisque in cognitione Dei profecit, eo minus habet excusationis; … deinde hoc genus officii est, quod natura ipsa dictat, sunt enim <span class="greekheb">στοργαὶ φυσικαί</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reference of this general thought varies according to the various interpretations of <a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>. If <span class="greekheb">τέκνα καὶ ἔκγονα</span> be taken there as the subject of <span class="greekheb">μανθανέτωσαν</span>, then it refers to the relation of these to the widowed mother or grandmother; if the proper subject be <span class="greekheb">αἱ χῆραι</span>, it refers naturally to the conduct of the widows. There is nothing to show that the apostle here was thinking of the mutual relation between the widows and their dependants (Matthies). Still less correct is it, with Hofmann, to wrench <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a> away from <a href="/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>, and to understand by <span class="greekheb">τις</span> “<span class="ital">the father of a family</span>,” “who at his death leaves wife and child unprovided for, when he might well have provided for them.” Such a sudden transition from what hitherto has been the subject of discussion would be exceedingly strange; nor is there any hint of it given by the verb <span class="greekheb">προνοεῖν</span>, which denotes care in general terms, not “care for those left behind at death.” Paul has hitherto been speaking of the conduct of widows, and only to that same subject can this verse be referred.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a>. The Christian faith includes the law of love. The moral teaching of Christianity recognises the divine origin of all natural and innocent human affections. The unbeliever, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the born heathen, possesses natural family affection; and though these feelings may be stunted by savagery, the heathen are not likely to be sophisticated by human perversions of religion, such as those denounced by Jesus in Mark 7. Ell. says. “It is worthy of notice that the Essenes were not permitted to give relief to their relatives without leave from their <span class="greekheb">ἐπίτροποι</span>, though they might freely do so to others in need; see Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell. Jud</span>. ii. 8, 6.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Christian who falls below the best heathen standard of family affection is the more blameworthy, since he has, what the heathen has not, the supreme example of love in Jesus Christ. We may add that Jesus Himself gave an example of providing for one’s own, when He provided a home for His mother with the beloved disciple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἴδιοι</span> are near relatives: <span class="greekheb">οἱ οἰκεῖοι</span>, members of one’s household. One of the most subtle temptations of the Devil is his suggestion that we can best comply with the demands of duty in some place far away from our home.

It was the technical word for the heathen who had not yet ‘professed the faith,’ just as its opposite ‘faithful’ or ‘believer’ is the term used of all who had been admitted into the Christian body; e.g. <a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 1:1</a>, and here, <a href="/1_timothy/5-16.htm" title="If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:16</a>. The clause has no sting therefore such as attaches to ‘infidel,’ implying the deliberate rejection of religion.
