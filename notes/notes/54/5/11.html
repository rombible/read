but it wisely excluded the younger women from a position and from duties which they might in their first days of grief and desolation covet, but of which, as time passed on—as experience had shown St. Paul—they not unfrequently wearied.

On the word <span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιασωσι</span>, rendered <span class="ital">to wax wanton, </span>Erasmus remarks, that it comes from <span class="greekheb">στερειν</span>, <span class="ital">to pull away, </span>and <span class="greekheb">ηνια</span>, <span class="ital">reins, </span>and that the metaphor is taken from high-fed brute animals, which, having pulled away the reins, run about at their pleasure. Le Clerc and some others translate the clause, <span class="ital">who do not obey the rein. </span>The apostle plainly means, that the younger widows, who had undertaken the office of teaching the young of their own sex, not being willing to continue under that restraint from marriage which they had laid on themselves by devoting themselves to the service of Christ, and which the nature of their office required, would marry, and desert his service. <span class="ital">Having damnation — Condemnation </span>rather, both from God and men; <span class="ital">because they have cast off their first faith — </span>Have deserted their trust in God, and have acted contrary to their first conviction, namely, that wholly to devote themselves to his service was the most excellent way; for their first faith here means that faithfulness to Christ which they had virtually plighted, when they took on them the office of teaching the younger women; for by marrying they put it out of their power to perform that office with the attention and assiduity which it required. <span class="ital">And withal they learn to be idle </span>— Slothful and negligent in the office they have undertaken, and instead of attending to the proper duty of their charge, <span class="ital">wandering about, &c.; tattlers also </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">φλυαροι</span>, <span class="ital">triflers, foolish talkers, </span>or talebearers; a vice to which women, who go about from house to house, are commonly much addicted; <span class="ital">busy-bodies </span>— Concerning themselves unnecessarily and impertinently in the affairs of others; <span class="ital">speaking things which they ought not </span>— Things very unbecoming.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the younger widows refuse - That is, in respect to the matter under discussion. Do not admit them into the class of widows referred to. It cannot mean that he was to reject them as members of the church, or not to treat them with respect and kindness.<p>For when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ - There is probably a thought conveyed by these words to most minds which is by no means in the original, and which does injustice both to the apostle and to the "younger widows" referred to. In the Greek there is no idea of wantonness in the sense of lasciviousness or lewdness; nor was this, though now a common idea attached to the word, by any means essential to it when our translation wan made. The word "wanton" then meant "wandering" or "roving in gaiety or sport; moving or flying loosely; playing in the wind; then, wandering from moral rectitude, licentious, dissolute, libidinous" - Webster. The Greek word here used, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  katastre&#772;niazo&#772;, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The word &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;  stre&#772;niao&#772; - however, is used twice, and is in both cases translated "lived deliciously;" <a href="//biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a>. The word is derived from &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  stre&#772;nos (whence "strenuous"), properly meaning "rudeness, insolence, pride," and hence, "revel, riot, luxury;" or from - streenees - , the adjective - "strong, stiff, hard, rough." The verb then means "to live strenuously, rudely," as in English, "to live hard;" also, to live wild, or without restraint; to run riot, to live luxuriously. The idea of strength is the essential one, and then of strength that is not subordinate to law; that is wild and riotous; see Pussow and Robinson, Lexicon. The sense here is, that they would not be subordinate to the restraints implied in that situation, they would become impatient, and would marry again. The idea is not that of wantonness or lewdness, but it is that of a mind not subdued by age and by trials, and that would be impatient under the necessary restraints of the condition which was contemplated. They could not be depended on with certainty, but they might be expected again to enter into the married relation.<p>They will marry - It is clear, from this, that the apostle did not contemplate any vows which would prevent their marrying again; nor does he say that it would be absolutely wrong for them to marry, even if they were admitted in to that rank; or as if there were any vows to restrain them from doing it. This passage, therefore, can never be adduced in favor of that practice of taking the veil in nunneries, and of a vow of perpetual seclusion from the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. younger&#8212;than sixty years old (1Ti 5:9).<p>refuse&#8212;to take on the roll of presbyteress widows.<p>wax wanton&#8212;literally, "over-strong" (2Ch 26:16).<p>against Christ&#8212;rebelling against Christ, their proper Bridegroom [Jerome].<p>they will&#8212;Greek, "they wish"; their desire is to marry again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But the younger widows refuse:</span> by <span class="ital">the younger widows</span> the apostle seems (by the last words of this verse) not to mean those that were under threescore, but the younger sort of widows, not past child-bearing; he would not have those (that is, being under no extraordinary circumstances of sickness, or lameness, or the want of their senses) be maintained at the charge of the church, because they were able to labour; nor yet to be taken into any employment relating to the church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ; </span> katastrhniaswsi tou cristou.

Luther: “the young widows, however, get rid of.”[181] The reason for this injunction is given by the apostle in the next words: <span class="greekheb">ὅταν γὰρ καταστρηνιάσωσι τοῦ Χριστοῦ γαμεῖν θέλουσιν</span>] The meaning of the verb is variously given by expositors. Several take it as equivalent to “be voluptuous, lust after,” and so refer it to sexual relation, appealing to <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm" title="And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall mourn her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,">Revelation 18:9</a>, where <span class="greekheb">στρηνιᾷν</span> is used along with <span class="greekheb">πορνεύειν</span>. But this collocation does not prove that the verbs are related in sense, all the less that in the passage <span class="greekheb">πορνεύειν</span> is not used literally. Even in <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm" title="For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.">Revelation 18:3</a>, <span class="greekheb">στρῆνος</span> has not the meaning of sexual desire, but more generally of “<span class="ital">wantonness</span>.” There is no justification, therefore, for de Wette’s translation: “to feel sexual desire,” and that of Jerome (<span class="ital">Ep</span>. 123, al. 11, <span class="ital">ad Agcrochiam</span> al. <span class="ital">Gerontiam</span>): quae fornicatae sunt. Others maintain here the more general meaning of the word luxuriari (Wiesinger; van Oosterzee also translates: “if they have become luxurious,” but explains it of voluptuous desire, of the pruritus libidinosus). Since the word <span class="greekheb">στρῆνος</span> also occurs in the sense of violent desire for something (<span class="ital">Lycophr.</span> 438, see Pape, 5, <span class="ital">s.v.</span>), Plitt explains <span class="greekheb">στρηνιᾷν</span> as equivalent to “go in pursuit of the satisfaction of one’s desires,” but without saying what desires are here meant. In Pape, the word is explained as equivalent to “be insolent” (<span class="greekheb">στρῆνος</span> = “insolence”); so, too, in Stephanus (<span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιάω</span> = insolentius et lascivius me gero adversum); similarly Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">καθυπερηφανεύεσθαι</span>. It will be most correct to adhere to the meaning “be luxurious.” In all these various explanations the prefix <span class="greekheb">κατα</span> is taken in the sense of hostile opposition, and the genitive <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> regarded as the object to which those widows are opposed by their <span class="greekheb">στρηνιᾷν</span>. This reference of <span class="greekheb">κατα</span> is in entire accordance with Greek usage; comp. in the N. T. the words: <span class="greekheb">καταδυναστεύω</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατακαυχάομαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καταναρκάω</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατασοφίζομαι</span>. Hofmann’s explanation completely diverges from these: “After such widows have let the Saviour have their whole desire, after they have delighted in Him, they wish to marry.” For this interpretation of <span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιᾷν Χριστοῦ</span>, Hofmann appeals to <a href="/psalms/37-4.htm" title="Delight yourself also in the LORD: and he shall give you the desires of your heart.">Psalm 37:4</a>, where the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">הִתְעַנֵּג עַל־יְהֹוָה</span> (“rejoice in God, delight in God”) is translated in the LXX. by <span class="greekheb">καταστρυφᾷν τοῦ κυρίου</span>. But to this there are three objections—(1) This interpretation of <span class="greekheb">καταστρυφᾷν</span> in a good sense is quite singular in nature; (2) <span class="greekheb">καταστρυφᾷν</span> cannot without proof be considered identical with <span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιᾷν</span>; and (3) <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span> is explained simply by “after that,” whereas it properly means: “<span class="ital">in case that, so soon as</span>.” <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΑΝ</span></span></span> may indeed be sometimes rendered by “after that;” but whereas the latter only expresses the relation of time, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΑΝ</span></span></span> is only used in such cases of an inner relation. In the present case it shows that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΈΛΕΙΝ ΓΑΜΕῖΝ</span></span></span> is something which has its ground or presupposed condition in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΣΤΡΗΝΙᾷΝ</span></span></span> of the widows. But how can it be imagined that delight in the Lord gives any ground whatever for the desire of marriage?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Besides, the whole context compels us to take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΣΤΡ</span></span></span>. in a bad sense.[182]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γαμεῖν θέλουσιν</span>] We must not overlook the fact that Paul does not say simply <span class="greekheb">γαμοῦσιν</span>; he wishes here to bring out the direction in which their thoughts turn. If a widow received the honourable distinction of <span class="greekheb">καταλέγεσθαι</span>, she had to recognise it as her duty to devote her life henceforth to her office, to her works of love for the church. These she must regard as her life-vocation. But in young widows the worldly desire was roused only too easily, so that they put aside their life-vocation, and sought only their own satisfaction in forming a new marriage, thereby withdrawing themselves from the work for the church. Their thoughts were therefore turned to something else than the things to which their position in the church directed them.[183]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[181] Baur at an earlier period (<span class="ital">Die Sog. Pastoralbriefe</span>, p. 47) construed <span class="greekheb">νεώτεραι χῆραι</span> grammatically together, and only—very arbitrarily, it is true—maintained that these <span class="greekheb">χῆραι</span> are distinguished from those in ver. 9 by being only virgins (and not <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χῆραι</span>) bearing the name of <span class="greekheb">χῆραι</span>. Later (<span class="ital">Paulus, d. Ap. J. Chr</span>. p. 497) he expressed the opinion that <span class="greekheb">νεωτέρας</span> and <span class="greekheb">χήρας</span> are not to be taken together, that the one is the subject rather, the other the predicate, and that the words accordingly have the sense: “Younger persons of the female sex do not receive into the list of the <span class="greekheb">χῆραι</span>.” This only adds to the arbitrariness of the historian, the arbitrariness of the exegete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[182] Even earlier expositors rejected the strange opinion which Heydenreich adopts, that “<span class="greekheb">στρηνιᾷν</span> in its root-signification and origin <span class="greekheb">παρὰ τῷ στερεῖν καὶ ἀποσπᾷν τὰς ἡνίας</span> means, cast off the reins, he or become unbridled.”—Quite as wrong is the inversion of thought which Heinrichs takes up, saying: clarius mentem expressisset Ap. inverso ordine: <span class="greekheb">ὅταν γὰρ γαμεῖν θέλωσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιῶσι τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>; for <span class="greekheb">γαμεῖν θέλουσιν</span> is a consequence of the <span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιᾷν</span>, not <span class="ital">vice versâ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[183] It is to be noted that Paul does not speak of the <span class="greekheb">θέλειν γαμεῖν</span> on the part of the widows as necessarily a <span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιᾷν τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>. He is not uttering any general principle; he is dealing only with the actual circumstances which were occurring among the widows under discussion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="/1_timothy/5-11.htm" title="But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;">1 Timothy 5:11</a>. There are two main factors in the interpretation of this verse: (1) a general Church regulation—not laid down by St. Paul but found in existence by him—that a widow in receipt of relief should be <span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς γυνή</span>; and (2) his determination to make provision that no scandal should arise from broken vows. The notion was that there was a marriage tie between Christ and the Church widow. This would be <span class="ital">her first faith, her earliest and still valid plighted troth.

This verb is used of “profane and old wives’ fables” (<a href="/1_timothy/4-7.htm" title="But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather to godliness.">1 Timothy 4:7</a>), of “foolish and ignorant questionings” (<a href="/2_timothy/2-23.htm" title="But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do engender strifes.">2 Timothy 2:23</a>), of “a man that is heretical” (<a href="/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a>); so that, at first sight, it seems a harsh term to use in reference to “young widows”. But the harshness is explained when we remember that St. Paul is speaking, not of the widows in themselves, but as applicants for admission to the roll of specially privileged Church widows. In a Church still immature as to its organisation and <span class="ital">morale</span> the authorities would be only courting disaster were they to assume the control of young widows, a class whose condition gave them independence in the heathen society around them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καταστρηνιάσωσιν</span>: <span class="ital">Cum enim luxuriatae fuerint</span> [<span class="ital">in deliciis egerint</span>, [280]110] <span class="ital">in Christo</span> (Vulg.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[280] <span class="ital">Speculum</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word denotes the particular character of their restiveness.

The sense, therefore, is that these young widows, in the wantonness and unsubdued worldliness of their hearts, reject the yoke of Christ, and kick against the widow's life of prayer and supplication day and night.
