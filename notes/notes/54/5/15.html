Although these unhappy sisters had worked such great mischief to the cause of Christ, still St. Paul, with his tender grace and love, forbore to mention any by name.

Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For some are already turned aside after Satan - That is, some young widows.

But the words are capable of another meaning, equally arising kern the preceding verse, viz. that some have already followed the example of Satan, "the accuser of the brethren," and have begun to revile Christianity, taking occasion from the conduct of some who were called Christians. These revilers might be not unbelieving Jews or heathen, but apostate or heretical Jews like those of whom the same verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is used in <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>.
