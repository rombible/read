We find also that, in the first years which succeeded the Ascension, many <span class= "ital">widows</span> in Jerusalem seemed to have been dependent on the Church for sustenance (<a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>). Now we should expect to find in the Church of Christ the same loving care which was taken in the old days, when Israel was a great nation, of these solitary and unhappy women. (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm" title="You shall not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>, where we find special laws respecting the garments of widows never to be taken in pledge. See, too, such passages as <a href="/exodus/22-22.htm" title="You shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-19.htm" title="Cursed be he that perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm" title="Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-6.htm" title="If you oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:">Jeremiah 7:6</a>; also <a href="/isaiah/10-2.htm" title="To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!">Isaiah 10:2</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>.) Still, this hardly accounts for the statement of <a href="/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a> and these lengthened directions to Timothy. It is more than probable that there were, especially in these Eastern cities, a very large class of these desolate and unprotected women. The practice of polygamy is accountable for this, in the first instance; and the rigid morality of the Christian teaching would place a bar to the female convert from heathenism relapsing into a life where moral restraints were utterly disregarded. The charities of the early Church, especially in Oriental cities, were, without doubt, heavily burdened with this grave and increasing charge—provision for these poor desolate women; and it was to relieve the congregations in some degree that St. Paul wrote these elaborate instructions to Timothy, warning him, as the chief minister of the Ephesian Church, against an indiscriminate charity, and at the same time providing him with a system of severe restraints to be imposed upon the assisted women.<p>Still, the chief pastor in Ephesus must remember that among the women of his flock there were <span class= "ital">some</span> widows indeed, with neither children nor grandchildren to assist them, without friends even to cheer their desolate, widowed life. To find out and to succour these poor, sad-hearted, friendless beings, St. Paul reminds Timothy, was one of the duties of a Christian minister.<p><span class= "bld">Trusteth in</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>—These, without love of child or friend, cast themselves on the support of the everlasting arms. The language here used by St. Paul pictures, evidently, some loving and trustful character then living, of whom he was thinking while writing the Letter to Timothy. “<span class= "ital">She hath</span> trusted and still trusts in God; she continues in prayer night and day.”<p><span class= "bld">And continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</span>—Like Anna, the daughter of Phanuel (<a href="/context/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36-37</a>), whom some suppose St. Paul took as the model and example for these Christian widows. The meaning of these words, descriptive of a holy life, is not that the earnest and pious bereaved woman should pass her days and nights in the unrelieved monotony of constantly repeated prayers. Such a life, unpractical and useless, would never commend itself to one like St. Paul; the words simply describe the desolate one casting all her care on the Lord, and telling Him, as her only friend, of all her thoughts and actions, her words and her works.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day....">1 Timothy 5:5-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now she who is a widow indeed — </span>Deprived of all support from her relations and friends. The apostle seems to allude to the signification of the word <span class="greekheb">χηρα</span>, rendered <span class="ital">widow, </span>which comes from <span class="greekheb">χηρος</span>, <span class="ital">orbus, desertus, </span>a person destitute, forsaken: <span class="ital">and desolate </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μεμονωμενη</span>, <span class="ital">reduced to solitude, </span>having neither children nor grand- children to relieve her; <span class="ital">trusteth in God </span>— Having no one else to trust in; <span class="ital">and continueth in supplications and prayers, </span>&c. — Devotes herself wholly to the service of God, spending a great part of her time by day and night in devotion. <span class="ital">But she who liveth in pleasure </span>— Delicately, voluptuously, in elegant regular sensuality, though not in the use of any such pleasures as are unlawful in themselves.

She is spiritually dead, dead to true piety and virtue. <span class="ital">These things give in charge </span>— For they are things which concern Christians in all circumstances and relations of life, who are too ready to seek happiness in the pursuit of sensual pleasure; <span class="ital">that they may be blameless </span>— The gender of the word here rendered <span class="ital">blameless </span>shows that the Ephesian <span class="ital">brethren, </span>not the widows, were the persons to whom Timothy was to give these things in charge. Probably either the deacons, or Timothy’s hearers in general, were intended. Indeed, in so luxurious a city as Ephesus, widows could not be the only persons who were in danger of failing into such sensualities as the apostle had been warning them against.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:3-8 Honour widows that are widows indeed, relieve them, and maintain them. It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to believe the doctrines of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A widow indeed, and desolate - The word rendered "desolate" means "solitary, alone."

She must be not one "that liveth in pleasure" (1Ti 5:6), but one making God her main hope (the accusative in Greek expresses that God is the ultimate aim whereto her hope is directed; whereas, 1Ti 4:10, dative expresses hope resting on God as her present stay [Wiesinger]), and continuing constantly in prayers. Her destitution of children and of all ties to earth would leave her more unencumbered for devoting the rest of her days to God and the Church (1Co 7:33, 34). Compare also "Anna a widow," who remained unmarried after her husband's death and "departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers day and night" (Lu 2:36, 37). Such a one, Paul implies, would be the fittest object for the Church's help (1Ti 5:3); for such a one is promoting the cause of Christ's Church by her prayers for it. "Ardor in prayers flows from hoping confidence in God" [Leo].<p>in supplications and prayers&#8212;Greek, "in her supplications and prayers"; the former signifies asking under a sense of need, the latter, prayer (see on [2475]1Ti 2:1; [2476]Php 4:6).<p>night and day&#8212;another coincidence with Luke (Lu 18:7, "cry day and night"); contrast Satan's accusations "day and night" (Re 12:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate:</span> the apostle here opens the term of <span class="ital">widow indeed, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:3</a></span>; one that is memonwmenh one that is made alone, destitute of such as ought to help her, a husband, or children; and being so, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">trusteth in God; </span> is a believer, reposing her trust and confidence in God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day; </span> spendeth her time religiously in prayer and acts of devotion.

With this we may compare what Luke (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm" title="And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.">Luke 2:37</a>) says of Anna the prophetess. Jerome (<span class="ital">Ep. ad Gerontiam</span>): quibus deus spes est, et omne opus oratio. Matthies rightly remarks: “The idea of the genuine widow is explained not abstractly, but in concrete form, in actual realization, for which reason we have the indicative used instead of the imperative or optative, as if a single representative of the whole class were described in living, personal form.” Hofmann will not allow this natural explanation to stand, because “the predicate which names a moral behaviour does not accord with a subject denoting an outward state.” Taking <span class="greekheb">ἣ δέ</span> as a relative pronoun, he connects it with <span class="greekheb">ἤλπικεν ἐπὶ Θ</span>., and regards <span class="greekheb">καὶ προσμενεῖ</span> (for <span class="greekheb">προσμένει</span>) as the apodosis, <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χήρα καὶ μεμονωμένη</span> forming an affix to <span class="greekheb">ἣ δέ</span>. Apart from the objection that the meaning advanced by Hofmann would have been expressed much more naturally by <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ὄντως χήρα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μεμ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ἣ ἤλπικεν ἐπὶ Θεὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ προσμενεῖ</span>, the meaning would be far from appropriate here. Besides, it gives no characteristic mark of the widow, for the hope which results in continual prayer is not peculiar to widows. Hofmann in his polemics does not observe that, in the apostle’s presupposition, she whose outward condition is more definitely described is a believing widow. When this is observed, we cannot deny the appropriateness of the reference (in Wiesinger) to <a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm" title="But I would have you without carefulness.

A widow with children or grandchildren able to support her is not altogether desolate. As regards the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, rendered "now" both in the A.V. and the R.V., Bishop Ellicott rightly renders it "but." The apostle is contrasting the condition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, who has only God to look to for help, and who passes her time in prayer, with that of the widow with children and grandchildren. The second "but" in ver. 6 is no real objection; the widow who "giveth herself to pleasure ' is contrasted in her turn with the devout prayerful widow whose conduct has just been described. The inference intended to be drawn, as Ellicott justly remarks, is that the one is eminently fit, and the other eminently unfit, to be supported at the common charge of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Hath her hope set on God</span> (see <a href="/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Supplications and prayers</span> (see <a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Night and day.</span> Perhaps <span class="accented">by night and by day</span> would express the genitive better (<a href="/matthew/2-14.htm">Matthew 2:14</a>; <a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>), as indicating time <span class="accented">when</span>, rather than time <span class="accented">how long</span>.

As regards the order of the words, "day and night," or "night and day," there seems to be no rule. St. Mark always has "night and day" (<a href="/mark/4-7.htm">Mark 4:7</a>; <a href="/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a>); St. Luke uses both (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>; <a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>; <a href="/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>; <a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/acts/26-7.htm">Acts 26:7</a>).
