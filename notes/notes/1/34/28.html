As nothing secures us better than true religion, so nothing exposes us more than religion only pretended to. But Simeon and Levi were most unrighteous. Those who act wickedly, under the pretext of religion, are the worst enemies of the truth, and harden the hearts of many to destruction. The crimes of others form no excuse for us. Alas! how one sin leads on to another, and, like flames of fire, spread desolation in every direction! Foolish pleasures lead to seduction; seduction produces wrath; wrath thirsts for revenge; the thirst of revenge has recourse to treachery; treachery issues in murder; and murder is followed by other lawless actions. Were we to trace the history of unlawful commerce between the sexes, we should find it, more than any other sin, ending in blood.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Simon and Levi, at the head no doubt of all their father's men, now fall upon the Shekemites, when feverish with the circumcision, and put them to the sword. Simon and Levi were the sons of Leah, and therefore, full brothers of Dinah. If Dinah was of the same year as Joseph, they would be respectively seven and six years older than she was. If she was in her thirteenth year, they would therefore, be respectively in their twentieth and nineteenth years, and therefore, suited by age and passion for such an enterprise. All the sons of Jacob joined in the sacking of the city. They seized all their cattle and goods, and made captives of their wives and little ones. Jacob is greatly distressed by this outrage, which is equally contrary to his policy and his humanity. He sets before his sons, in this expostulation, the danger attendant upon such a proceeding. The "Kenaanite and the Perizzite," whom Abraham found in the land on his return from Egypt <a href="/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>. "I am a few men" - men of number that might easily be counted. I here denotes the family or tribe with all its dependents. When expanded, therefore, it is, "I and my house." Simon and Levi have their reply. It justifies the retribution which has fallen on the Shekemites for this and all their other crimes. But it does not justify the executioners for taking the law into their own hands, or proceeding by fraud and indiscriminate slaughter. The employment of circumcision, too, which was the sign of the covenant of grace, as a means of deception, was a heinous aggravation of their offence. <p> - The Death of Isaac<p>8. &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;  debora&#770;h, Deborah, "bee." &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;  'alo&#770;n-ba&#772;ku&#770;t, Allon-bakuth, "oak of weeping."<p>16. &#1499;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;  k&#305;&#770;bra&#770;h, "length stretch."

Hamor and Shechem &#8230; came unto the gate of their city&#8212;That was the place where every public communication was made; and in the ready obsequious submission of the people to this measure we see an evidence either of the extraordinary affection for the governing family, or of the abject despotism of the East, where the will of a chief is an absolute command.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus they add to their cruelty theft and robbery, which doubtless Jacob disowned when they brought the spoil home, and returned back both the surviving people and their goods, though it be passed over in silence, as many other things are. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="/genesis/33-14.htm" title="Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goes before me and the children be able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.">Genesis 33:14</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They took their sheep, their oxen, and their asses,.... The Shechemites hoped to have the cattle and substance of Jacob's family, and in a hypocritical manner submitted to circumcision, for the sake of worldly advantage; for that, and pleasing their prince, seem to be the only views they had in it; wherefore, in this there is a just retaliation of them in Providence: <p>and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field; the cattle that were kept at home, and those that were brought up in the field, all became a prey. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The condition seemed reasonable to the two suitors, and by way of setting a good example, "the young man did not delay to do this word," i.e., to submit to circumcision, "as he was honoured before all his father's house." This is stated by anticipation in <a href="/genesis/34-19.htm">Genesis 34:19</a>; but before submitting to the operation, he went with his father to the gate, the place of public assembly, to lay the matter before the citizens of the town. They knew so well how to make the condition palatable, by a graphic description of the wealth of Jacob and his family, and by expatiating upon the advantages of being united with them, that the Shechemites consented to the proposal. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;: integri, people whose bearing is unexceptionable. "And the land, behold broad on both sides it is before them," i.e., it offers space enough in every direction for them to wander about with their flocks. And then the gain: "Their cattle, and their possessions, and their beasts of burden...shall they not be ours?" &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492; is used here for flocks and herds, &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; for beasts of burden, viz., camels and asses (cf. <a href="/numbers/32-26.htm">Numbers 32:26</a>). But notwithstanding the advantages here pointed out, the readiness of all the citizens of Shechem (vid., <a href="/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>) to consent to be circumcised, could only be satisfactorily explained from the fact that this religious rite was already customary in different nations (according to Herod. 2, 104, among the Egyptians and Colchians), as an act of religious or priestly consecration. </body></html>
