When Abram went there, horses do not seem as yet to have been known (see Note on <a href="/genesis/12-16.htm" title="And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.">Genesis 12:16</a>), but oxen and asses were common, and the former indigenous in the country (Maspero, <span class= "ital">Histoire Ancienne, </span>pp. 11, 12). The horse was introduced by the Hyksos, according to Lenormant, <span class= "ital">Les Prem.

There was no bread, and the people were ready to die. See how we depend upon God's providence. All our wealth would not keep us from starving, if rain were withheld for two or three years. See how much we are at God's mercy, and let us keep ourselves always in his love. Also see how much we smart by our own want of care. If all the Egyptians had laid up corn for themselves in the seven years of plenty, they had not been in these straits; but they regarded not the warning. Silver and gold would not feed them: they must have corn. All that a man hath will he give for his life. We cannot judge this matter by modern rules. It is plain that the Egyptians regarded Joseph as a public benefactor. The whole is consistent with Joseph's character, acting between Pharaoh and his subjects, in the fear of God. The Egyptians confessed concerning Joseph, Thou hast saved our lives. What multitudes will gratefully say to Jesus, at the last day, Thou hast saved our souls from the most tremendous destruction, and in the season of uttermost distress! The Egyptians parted with all their property, and even their liberty, for the saving of their lives: can it then be too much for us to count all but loss, and part with all, at His command, and for His sake, who will both save our souls, and give us an hundredfold, even here, in this present world? Surely if saved by Christ, we shall be willing to become his servants.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/47.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph introduces remarkable changes into the relation of the sovereign and the people of Egypt. "There was no bread in all the land." The private stores of the wealthy were probably exhausted. "And Joseph gathered up all the silver." The old stores of grain and the money, which had flowed into the country during the years of plenty, seem to have lasted for five years. "And Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house." He was merely the steward of Pharaoh in this matter, and made a full return of all the payments that came into his hands. "The silver was spent." The famishing people have no more money; but they must have bread. Joseph is fertile in expedients. He proposes to take their cattle. This was really a relief to the people, as they had no means of providing them with fodder. The value of commodities is wholly altered by a change of circumstances. Pearls will not purchase a cup of water in a vast and dreary wilderness. Cattle become worthless when food becomes scarce, and the means of procuring it are exhausted. For their cattle Joseph supplies them with food during the sixth year.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/47.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. And Joseph said, Give your cattle&#8212;"This was the wisest course that could be adopted for the preservation both of the people and the cattle, which, being bought by Joseph, was supported at the royal expense, and very likely returned to the people at the end of the famine, to enable them to resume their agricultural labors."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/47.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/47.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they brought their cattle unto Joseph,.... Which they might the more readily do, since there was scarce any grass to feed them with; and though some of them were creatures used for food, yet might be so lean and poor for want of grass, as not to be fit to eat; and besides, they could do better without flesh than without bread: <p>and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses; with which Egypt abounded, to which many places of Scripture have respect, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, <p>and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds; the sheep and the oxen; which shows that these creatures were bred and fed by them, and were, no doubt, slain, and used for food: <p>and for the asses; which were used for carrying burdens: <p>and he fed them with bread for all their cattle, for that year; which seems to be the sixth year of the famine: one would wonder what Joseph should do with all their cattle, where put them, and feed them, in such a time of drought; though it is probable the number was not exceeding large, since they only fetched one year's provision of bread. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/47.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/47.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">horses … flocks, and for the herds</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">cattle of the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds</span>.

The settlement of the Israelites is called the land of Ramses (&#1512;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;&#1505;, in pause &#1512;&#1506;&#1502;&#1505;&#1505; <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>), instead of Goshen, either because the province of Goshen (&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;, lxx) is indicated by the name of its former capital Ramses (i.e., Heroopolis, on the site or in the immediate neighbourhood of the modern Abu Keisheib, in Wady Tumilat (vid., <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>), or because Israel settled in the vicinity of Ramses. The district of Goshen is to be sought in the modern province of el Sharkiyeh (i.e., the eastern), on the east side of the Nile, towards Arabia, still the most fertile and productive province of Egypt (cf. Robinson, Pal. i. 78, 79). For Goshen was bounded on the east by the desert of Arabia Petraea, which stretches away to Philistia (<a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>, cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/7-21.htm">1 Chronicles 7:21</a>) and is called &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc; &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; in the Septuagint in consequence (<a href="/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>), and must have extended westwards to the Nile, since the Israelites had an abundance of fish (<a href="/numbers/11-5.htm">Numbers 11:5</a>). It probably skirted the Tanitic arm of the Nile, as the fields of Zoan, i.e., Tanis, are said to have been the scene of the mighty acts of God in Egypt (<a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/78-43.htm">Psalm 78:43</a>, cf. <a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>). In this province Joseph assigned his relations settlements near to himself (<a href="/genesis/45-10.htm">Genesis 45:10</a>), from which they could quickly and easily communicate with one another (<a href="/genesis/46-28.htm">Genesis 46:28</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-1.htm">Genesis 48:1</a>.). Whether he lived at Ramses or not, cannot be determined, just because the residence of the Pharaoh of that time is not known, and the notion that it was at Memphis is only based upon utterly uncertain combinations relating to the Hyksos. </body></html>
