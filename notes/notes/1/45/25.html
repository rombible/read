We faint, because we do not believe. At length, Jacob is convinced of the truth. Jacob was old, and did not expect to live long. He says, Let my eyes be refreshed with this sight before they are closed, and then I need no more to make me happy in this world. Behold Jesus manifesting himself as a Brother and a Friend to those who once were his despisers, his enemies. He assures them of his love and the riches of his grace. He commands them to lay aside envy, anger, malice, and strife, and to live in peace with each other. He teaches them to give up the world for him and his fulness. He supplies all that is needful to bring them home to himself, that where he is they may be also. And though, when he at last sends for his people, they may for a time feel some doubts and fears, yet the thought of seeing his glory and of being with him, will enable them to say, It is enough, I am willing to die; and I go to see, and to be with the Beloved of my soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/45.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The returning brothers inform their father of the existence and elevation of Joseph in Egypt. The aged patriarch is overcome for the moment, but at length awakens to a full apprehension of the joyful news. His heart fainted; ceased to beat for a time, fluttered, sank within him. The news was too good for him to venture all at once to believe it. But the words of Joseph, which they recite, and the wagons which he had sent, at length lead to the conviction that it must be indeed true. He is satisfied. His only thought is to go and see Joseph before he dies. A sorrow of twenty-two years' standing has now been wiped away. <p> - Jacob Goes Down to Egypt<p>9. &#1508;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;  pallu&#770;', Pallu, "distinguished." &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;&#1503; chetsro&#770;n, Chetsron, of the "court," or "village." &#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;  karm&#305;&#770;y, Karmi, "vine-dresser."<p>10. &#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;  yemu&#770;'e&#770;l, Jemuel, "day of El." &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; ya&#770;m&#305;&#770;yn, Jamin, "right hand." &#1488;&#1492;&#1491;  'o&#770;had, Ohad, "joining together." &#1497;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;  ya&#770;k&#305;&#770;yn, Jakin, "he shall establish." &#1510;&#1495;&#1512;  tso&#770;char, Tsochar, "whiteness."<p>11. &#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;  ge&#770;resho&#770;n, Gereshon, "expelling." &#1511;&#1492;&#1514;  qeha&#770;th, Qehath, "assembly." &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;  mera&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, Merari, "flowing, bitter."<p>12. &#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;  cha&#770;mu&#770;l, Chamul, "pitied, treated with mercy."<p>13. &#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;  to&#770;la&#770;&#8219;, Tola', "worm, scarlet." &#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;  pu&#770;'a&#770;h, Puvvah, "mouth?" &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;  yo&#770;b, Job, "enemy?" &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1512;&#1503;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;mro&#770;n, Shimron, "watch."<p>14. &#1505;&#1512;&#1491;  sered, Sered, "fear." &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; 'e&#770;lo&#770;n, Elon, "oak." &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; yachle'e&#770;l, Jachleel, "El shall sicken or inspire with hope."<p>16. &#1510;&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;  ts&#305;&#770;phyo&#770;n, Tsiphjon, "watcher." &#1495;&#1490;&#1497;  chagg&#305;&#770;y, Chaggi, "festive." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; shu&#770;n&#305;&#770;y, Shuni, "quiet." &#1488;&#1510;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;  'etsbo&#770;n, Etsbon, "toiling?" &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;  &#8219;e&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, 'Eri, "watcher." &#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;  'a&#780;ro&#770;d&#305;&#770;y, Arodi, rover? &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;&#1497;  'ar'e&#770;l&#305;&#770;y, Areli, "lion of El?"<p>17. &#1497;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  y&#305;&#770;mna&#770;h, Jimnah, "prosperity." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;  y&#305;&#770;shva&#770;h, Jishvah, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1497;  y&#305;&#770;shv&#305;&#770;y, Jishvi, "even, level." &#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;  ber&#305;&#770;y&#8219;a&#770;h, Beri'ah, "in evil." &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1495;  s&#769;erach, Serach, "overflow." &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;  cheber, Cheber, "fellowship." &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;  malk&#305;&#770;y'e&#770;l Malkiel, "king of EL"<p>21. &#1489;&#1500;&#1506;  bela&#8219;, Bela', "devouring." &#1489;&#1499;&#1512;  beker, Beker, "a young camel." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1500;  'ashbe&#770;l Ashbel, "short?" &#1490;&#1512;&#1488;  ge&#770;ra&#770;', Gerah, "a grain." &lt;&#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1503; na&#8219;a&#774;ma&#770;n, Na'aman, "pleasant." &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;  'e&#770;ch&#305;&#770;y Echi, "brotherly?" &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  ro&#770;'sh, Rosh, "head." &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;  mu&#770;pp&#305;&#770;ym, Muppim, &#1495;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;  chu&#770;pp&#305;&#770;ym, Chuppim, "covering." &#1488;&#1512;&#1491; 'ard, Ard, "fugitive, rover."<p>23. &#1510;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  chu&#770;sh&#305;&#770;ym, Chushim, "haste."<p>24. &#1497;&#1495;&#1510;&#1488;&#1500; yachtse'e&#770;l, Jachtseel, "El will divide." &#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; gu&#770;n&#305;&#770;y, Guni, "dyed." &#1497;&#1510;&#1512;  ye&#770;tser, Jetser, "form." &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1501;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;lle&#770;m, Shillem, "retribution."<p>The second dream of Joseph is now to receive its fulfillment.

The sense is that Jacob s heart seemed to stop with amazement at the tidings which his sons brought), for he believed them not. This was scarcely a case of believing not for joy (Bush), but rather of incredulity arising from suspicion, both of the messengers and their message, which was only removed by further explanation, and in particular by the sight of Joseph's splendid presents and commodious carriages. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about Joseph's invitation and promise (vers. 9-11) - and when he saw the wagons - probably royal vehicles (Wordsworth) - which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived (literally, <span class="accented">lived</span>; it having been previously numb and cold, as if dead): and Israel said, - the change of name here is significant. The sublime theocratic designation, which had dropped into obscurity during the period of the old man's sorrow for his lost son, revives with the resuscitation of his dead hope (cf. <a href="/genesis/43-6.htm">Genesis 43:6</a>) - It is enough (one word, as if expressing his complacent satisfaction); Joseph my son is yet alive (this is the one thought that fills his aged heart): I will go down - "The old man is young again in spirit; he is for going immediately; he could leap; yes, fly" (Lange) - and see him (a sight of Joseph would be ample compensation for all the years of sorrow he had passed through) before I die.

From time immemorial Egypt was rich in small, two-wheeled carriages, which could be used even where there were no roads (cf. <a href="/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6</a>. with <a href="/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>). "Let not your eye look with mourning (&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1505;) at your goods;" i.e., do not trouble about the house-furniture which you are obliged to leave behind. The good-will manifested in this invitation of Pharaoh towards Jacob's family was to be attributed to the feeling of gratitude to Joseph, and "is related circumstantially, because this free and honourable invitation involved the right of Israel to leave Egypt again without obstruction" (Delitzsch). </body></html>
