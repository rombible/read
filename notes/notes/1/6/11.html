An absolutely new beginning was to be made by Noah, such as Adam had to undertake when he was expelled from Paradise.

Let this be our chief desire, let us labour that we may be accepted of him. When the rest of the world was wicked, Noah kept his integrity. God's good-will towards Noah produced this good work in him. He was a just man, that is, justified before God, by faith in the promised Seed. As such he was made holy, and had right principles; and was righteous in his conversation. He was not only honest, but devout; it was his constant care to do the will of God. God looks down upon those with an eye of favour, who sincerely look up to him with an eye of faith. It is easy to be religious when religion is in fashion; but it shows strong faith and resolution, to swim against the stream, and to appear for God when no one else appears for him; Noah did so. All kinds of sin were found among men. They corrupted God's worship. Sin fills the earth with violence, and this fully justified God's resolution to destroy the world. The contagion spread. When wickedness is become general, ruin is not far off; while there is a remnant of praying people in a nation, to empty the measure as it fills, judgments may be long kept off; but when all hands are at work to pull down the fences, by sin, and none stand in the gap to make up the breach, what can be expected but a flood of wrath?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the land was corrupt. - In contrast with Noah, the rest of the race were corrupt - entirely depraved by sin.

This corruption is represented as corrupting the whole earth and filling it with wickedness; and thus the judgment of the flood is for the first time fully accounted for. "The earth was corrupt before God (Elohim points back to the previous Elohim in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>)," it became so conspicuous to God, that He could not refrain from punishment. The corruption proceeded from the fact, that "all flesh" - i.e., the whole human race which had resisted the influence of the Spirit of God and become flesh (see <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>) - "had corrupted its way." The term "flesh" in <a href="/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a> cannot include the animal world, since the expression, "corrupted its way," is applicable to man alone. The fact that in <a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13</a> and <a href="/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a> this term embraces both men and animals is no proof to the contrary, for the simple reason, that in <a href="/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a> "all flesh" denotes the animal world only, an evident proof that the precise meaning of the word must always be determined from the context.</body></html>
