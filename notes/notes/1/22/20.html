But besides the domestic interest, the knowledge thus conveyed to him was the cause “probably of Abraham’s determination to seek a wife for his son from among his own kindred. It has been noticed that Nahor has twelve sons, eight by his lawful wife, and four by his concubine. So Jacob has twelve sons, eight by two lawful wives, and four by two concubines. Lastly, Ishmael has twelve sons. These coincidences are curious, but afford no ground for the assertion that therefore these narratives are mythical. For coincidences quite as strange are to be found in every history, and in daily life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/22-20.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she has also born children to your brother Nahor;">Genesis 22:20</a></span>.

The genealogy seems to represent a recollection of the traditional names of the prehistoric ancestors of the Hebrew immigrants. Probably the introduction of the genealogy at this point is due to the mention of Rebekah in <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/22-23.htm" title="And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.">Genesis 22:23</a></span>, which prepares the way for the story in 24 (J).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass after these things</span> (probably not long after his return to Beersheba), <span class="cmt_word">that it was told</span> (by some unknown messenger or accidental traveler from Mesopotamia) <span class="cmt_word">Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>), <span class="cmt_word">she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor</span> - as Sarah has born a son to thee.
