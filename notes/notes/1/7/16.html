Hypocrites in the church, who outwardly conform to the laws of that ark, are yet unchanged; and it will appear, one time or other, what kind they are after. God continued his care of Noah. God shut the door, to secure him and keep him safe in the ark; also to keep all others for ever out. In what manner this was done, God has not been pleased to make known. There is much of our gospel duty and privilege to be seen in Noah's safety in the ark. The apostle makes it a type of christian baptism, 1Pe 3:20,21. Observe then, it is our great duty, in obedience to the gospel call, by a lively faith in Christ, to come into that way of salvation which God has provided for poor sinners. Those that come into the ark, should bring as many as they can with them, by good instructions, by persuasions, and by good examples. There is room enough in Christ for all comers. God put Adam into paradise, but did not shut him in, so he threw himself out; but when God put Noah into the ark, and so when he brings a soul to Christ, the salvation is sure: it is not in our own keeping, but in the Mediator's hand. But the door of mercy will shortly be shut against those that now make light of it. Knock now, and it shall be opened, Lu 13:25.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is a simple grandeur in the threefold description of the entrance of Noah and his retinue into the ark, first in the command, next in the actual process during the seven days, and, lastly, in the completed act on the seventh day. "Every living thing after its kind" is here unaccompanied with the epithet &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;  ra&#772;&#8219;a&#770;h, evil, or the qualifying term of the land or of the field, and therefore may, we conceive, be taken in the extent of <a href="/genesis/6-20.htm">Genesis 6:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/7-2.htm">Genesis 7:2-3</a>, <a href="/genesis/7-6.htm">Genesis 7:6</a>. At all events the whole of the wild animals did not need to be included in the ark, as their range was greater than that of antediluvian man or of the flood. "And the Lord shut him in." This is a fitting close to the scene. The whole work was manifestly the Lord's doing, from first to last. The personal name of God is appropriately introduced here. For the Everlasting now shows himself to be the causer or effecter of the covenant blessing promised to Noah. In what way the Lord shut him in is an idle question, altogether unworthy of the grandeur of the occasion. We can tell nothing more than what is written. We are certain that it would be accomplished in a manner worthy of him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. and the Lord shut him in&#8212;literally, "covered him round about." The "shutting him in" intimated that Noah had become the special object of divine care and protection, and that to those without the season of grace was over (Mt 25:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">shut</span> the door <span class="ital">after him, </span> or <span class="ital">upon him, </span> or <span class="ital">for him, </span> i.e. his good and safety, against the fury either of the waters or of the people.

These pairs were not two males or two females, but one male and one female; so they were coupled for the propagation of their species, which was the end of their entering into the ark, and being preserved: <p>as God had commanded him: Noah, who took care, as they entered, that there were so many of a sort as was enjoined, and these were male and female: <p>and the Lord shut him in; or shut the door after him (l), he being the last that entered; and which he could not so well shut himself, at least so close, as was done by the Lord, or by the angels; and this was done to keep out the waters, and all within in safety; and to shut out others, and preserve Noah from the rage of wicked men, as well as the violence of the waters: some (m) have thought that not so much the door of the ark is meant, as the way to it, the pensile bridge which was necessary for the creatures to enter the ark; which being carried away by the force of the waters near the ark, that not being joined to it, precluded all access of the scoffers, whose scoffs were soon turned to lamentation and howling. <p>(l) "post ipsum", Vatablus, Tigurine version, Cocceius, Schmidt.

"On the supposition of an independent Jehovistic narrative, Bishop Colenso feels it necessary to interpolate before the next statement the words, 'And Noah and all his house went into the ark'" (Quarry, p. 379). <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord</span> (Jehovah) <span class="cmt_word">shut him in</span>.

The contrast between the two names of the Deity is here most vividly presented. It is Elohim who commands him about the beasts; it is Jehovah, the covenant God, who insures his safety by closing the ark behind him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"In the self-same day had Noah...entered into the ark:" &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, pluperfect "had come," not came, which would require &#1497;&#1489;&#1488;.
