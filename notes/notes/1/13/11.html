Passion and selfishness make men rude. Lot looked to the goodness of the land; therefore he doubted not that in such a fruitful soil he should certainly thrive. But what came of it? Those who, in choosing relations, callings, dwellings, or settlements, are guided and governed by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, cannot expect God's presence or blessing. They are commonly disappointed even in that which they principally aim at. In all our choices this principle should rule, That is best for us, which is best for our souls. Lot little considered the badness of the inhabitants. The men of Sodom were impudent, daring sinners. This was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness, Eze 16:49. God often gives great plenty to great sinners. It has often been the vexatious lot of good men to live among wicked neighbours; and it must be the more grievous, if, as Lot here, they have brought it upon themselves by a wrong choice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lot accepts the offer of his noble-hearted kinsman. He cannot do otherwise, as he is the companion, while his uncle is the principal. He willingly concedes to Abram his present position, and, after a lingering attendance on his kinsman, retires to take the ground of self-dependence. Outward and earthly motives prevail with him in the selection of his new abode. He is charmed by the well-watered lowlands bordering on the Jordan and its affluents. He is here less liable to a periodical famine, and he roams with his serfs and herds in the direction of Sodom. This town and Amorah (Gomorrah), were still flourishing at the time of Lot's arrival. The country in which they stood was of extraordinary beauty and fertility. The River Jordan, one of the sources of which is at Panium, after flowing through the waters of Merom, or the lake Semechonitis (Huleh), falls into the Sea of Galilee or Kinnereth, which is six hundred and fifty-three feet below the level of the Mediterranean, and thence descends into the basin of the Salt Sea, which is now thirteen hundred and sixteen feet beneath the same level, by a winding course of about two hundred miles, over twenty-seven threatening rapids.<p>This river may well be called the Descender. We do not know on what part of the border of Jordan Lot looked down from the heights about Shekem or Ai, as the country underwent a great change at a later period. But its appearance was then so attractive as to bear comparison with the garden of the Lord and the land of Egypt. The garden of Eden still dwelt in the recollections of men. The fertility of Egypt had been recently witnessed by the two kinsmen. It was a valley fertilized by the overflowing of the Nile, as this valley was by the Jordan and its tributary streams. "As thou goest unto Zoar." The origin of this name is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-20.htm">Genesis 19:20-22</a>. It lay probably to the south of the Salt Sea, in the wady Kerak. "And Lot journeyed east" &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1501;  m&#305;&#770;qedem. From the hill-country of Shekem or Ai the Jordan lay to the east.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Then Lot chose him all the plain&#8212;a choice excellent from a worldly point of view, but most inexpedient for his best interests.

Consequently disputes arose between the two parties of herdsmen. The difficulty was increased by the fact that the Canaanites and Perizzites were then dwelling in the land, so that the space was very contracted. The Perizzites, who are mentioned here and in <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-4.htm">Judges 1:4</a>, along with the Canaanites, and who are placed in the other lists of the inhabitants of Canaan among the different Canaanitish tribes (<a href="/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>, etc.), are not mentioned among the descendants of Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-17</a>), and may therefore, like the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, and Rephaim (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>), not have been descendants of Ham at all. The common explanation of the name Perizzite as equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; "inhabitant of the level ground" (<a href="/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>), is at variance not only with the form of the word, the inhabitant of the level ground being called &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497; (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>), but with the fact of their combination sometimes with the Canaanites, sometimes with the other tribes of Canaan, whose names were derived from their founders. Moreover, to explain the term "Canaanite," as denoting "the civilised inhabitants of towns," or "the trading Phoenicians," is just as arbitrary as if we were to regard the Kenites, Kenizzites, and the other tribes mentioned <a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>. along with the Canaanites, as all alike traders or inhabitants of towns. The origin of the name Perizzite is involved in obscurity, like that of the Kenites and other tribes settled in Canaan that were not descended from Ham. But we may infer from the frequency with which they are mentioned in connection with the Hamitic inhabitants of Canaan, that they were widely dispersed among the latter.
