God explains it, “To thee and thy seed,” that is, to thee “in thy seed.” But how could it be said to be given them “for ever,” when, after a few hundreds of years they were turned out of it? To this it must be replied, that the promise was made to them, and intended to be fulfilled, upon condition of their obedience, as is often expressed in other places. And the expression <span class="greekheb">עד עולם</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">for ever, </span>often signifies only <span class="ital">long continuance, </span>as is evident from many passages of Scripture, in which the subjects to which it is applied do not, in their nature, admit of an eternal duration. Indeed, when the word is applied to the Jewish rites and ceremonies, as it often is, it signifies no more than during the standing of that dispensation, or till the coming of the Messiah. And thus it may be here understood.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:10-13 Abram having offered Lot the choice, he at once accepted it. Passion and selfishness make men rude. Lot looked to the goodness of the land; therefore he doubted not that in such a fruitful soil he should certainly thrive. But what came of it? Those who, in choosing relations, callings, dwellings, or settlements, are guided and governed by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, cannot expect God's presence or blessing. They are commonly disappointed even in that which they principally aim at. In all our choices this principle should rule, That is best for us, which is best for our souls. Lot little considered the badness of the inhabitants. The men of Sodom were impudent, daring sinners. This was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness, Eze 16:49. God often gives great plenty to great sinners. It has often been the vexatious lot of good men to live among wicked neighbours; and it must be the more grievous, if, as Lot here, they have brought it upon themselves by a wrong choice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The men of Sodom were wicked. - The higher blessing of good society, then, was missing in the choice of Lot. It is probable he was a single man when he parted from Abram, and therefore that he married a woman of Sodom. He has in that case fallen into the snare of matching, or, at all events, mingling with the ungodly. This was the damning sin of the antediluvians <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-7</a>. "Sinners before the Lord exceedingly." Their country was as the garden of the Lord. But the beauty of the landscape and the superabundance of the luxuries it afforded, did not abate the sinful disposition of the inhabitants. Their moral corruption only broke forth into greater vileness of lust, and more daring defiance of heaven. They sinned "exceedingly and before the Lord." Lot had fallen into the very vortex of vice and blasphemy.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Then Lot chose him all the plain&#8212;a choice excellent from a worldly point of view, but most inexpedient for his best interests. He seems, though a good man, to have been too much under the influence of a selfish and covetous spirit: and how many, alas! imperil the good of their souls for the prospect of worldly advantage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Eminent, noted, and impudent sinners; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;">Genesis 18:20</a> <a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm" title="Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.">Ezekiel 16:49</a></span>; which is here added as a secret reproof to Lot, who was either careless in his inquiry into the dispositions and manners of those among whom he intended to fix his abode, which for many reasons he should have searched out; or he was willing to expose himself to all the hazards which he might incur by their neighbourhood and familiarity, for the sweetness and fertility of the soil; an error which is frequently committed by men in the choice of their habitations, and which oft costs them dear, as it did Lot in the following story. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the men of Sodom were wicked,.... Which either he knew not, and so ignorantly made this bad choice, to take up his abode among such very wicked men, which occasioned a great deal of grief, trouble, and vexation to him; or if he knew it, the pleasing prospect of convenience for his cattle, and of enriching himself, was a temptation to him, and prevailed upon him to take such a step; and so Jarchi interprets it, "although" they were so, Lot was not restrained from dwelling among them: <p>and sinners before the Lord exceedingly; exceeding great sinners, guilty of the most notorious crimes, and addicted to the most scandalous and unnatural lusts that can be thought of; and these they committed openly and publicly in the sight of God, in the most daring and impudent manner, and in defiance of him, without any fear or shame. The Targum of Jonathan reckons up many of their sins, as defrauding of one another in their substance, sinning in their bodies, incest, unclean copulation, shedding of innocent blood, worshipping of idols, and rebelling against the name of the Lord; see <a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the men of Sodom <i>were</i> wicked and <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> sinners before the LORD exceedingly.</span><p>(i) Lot thinking to get paradise, found hell.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners</span> their wickedness is more specifically detailed in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, q.v.) - <span class="cmt_word">before the Lord</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to Jehovah   =  </span> before the face of Jehovah; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 10:9; an aggravation of the wickedness of the Sodomites - <span class="cmt_word">exceedingly</span>.

Consequently disputes arose between the two parties of herdsmen. The difficulty was increased by the fact that the Canaanites and Perizzites were then dwelling in the land, so that the space was very contracted. The Perizzites, who are mentioned here and in <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-4.htm">Judges 1:4</a>, along with the Canaanites, and who are placed in the other lists of the inhabitants of Canaan among the different Canaanitish tribes (<a href="/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>, etc.), are not mentioned among the descendants of Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-17</a>), and may therefore, like the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, and Rephaim (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>), not have been descendants of Ham at all. The common explanation of the name Perizzite as equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; "inhabitant of the level ground" (<a href="/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>), is at variance not only with the form of the word, the inhabitant of the level ground being called &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497; (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>), but with the fact of their combination sometimes with the Canaanites, sometimes with the other tribes of Canaan, whose names were derived from their founders. Moreover, to explain the term "Canaanite," as denoting "the civilised inhabitants of towns," or "the trading Phoenicians," is just as arbitrary as if we were to regard the Kenites, Kenizzites, and the other tribes mentioned <a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>. along with the Canaanites, as all alike traders or inhabitants of towns. The origin of the name Perizzite is involved in obscurity, like that of the Kenites and other tribes settled in Canaan that were not descended from Ham. But we may infer from the frequency with which they are mentioned in connection with the Hamitic inhabitants of Canaan, that they were widely dispersed among the latter. Vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>. </body></html>
