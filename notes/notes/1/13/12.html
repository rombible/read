While, then, Abram continued to lead a hardy life as a stranger upon the bracing hills, Lot sighed for the less self-denying habits of the city; and probably, when he had descended into the Ghor, the enervating climate, which so developed the sensual vices of the people as to make them “sinners before Jehovah” (see on <a href="/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.">Genesis 10:9</a>), disposed Lot also to quit his tent, and yield himself to a luxurious and easy manner of living.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:10-13 Abram having offered Lot the choice, he at once accepted it. Passion and selfishness make men rude. Lot looked to the goodness of the land; therefore he doubted not that in such a fruitful soil he should certainly thrive. But what came of it? Those who, in choosing relations, callings, dwellings, or settlements, are guided and governed by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, cannot expect God's presence or blessing. They are commonly disappointed even in that which they principally aim at. In all our choices this principle should rule, That is best for us, which is best for our souls. Lot little considered the badness of the inhabitants. The men of Sodom were impudent, daring sinners. This was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness, Eze 16:49. God often gives great plenty to great sinners. It has often been the vexatious lot of good men to live among wicked neighbours; and it must be the more grievous, if, as Lot here, they have brought it upon themselves by a wrong choice.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The men of Sodom were wicked. - The higher blessing of good society, then, was missing in the choice of Lot. It is probable he was a single man when he parted from Abram, and therefore that he married a woman of Sodom. He has in that case fallen into the snare of matching, or, at all events, mingling with the ungodly. This was the damning sin of the antediluvians <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1-7</a>. "Sinners before the Lord exceedingly." Their country was as the garden of the Lord. But the beauty of the landscape and the superabundance of the luxuries it afforded, did not abate the sinful disposition of the inhabitants. Their moral corruption only broke forth into greater vileness of lust, and more daring defiance of heaven. They sinned "exceedingly and before the Lord." Lot had fallen into the very vortex of vice and blasphemy.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Then Lot chose him all the plain&#8212;a choice excellent from a worldly point of view, but most inexpedient for his best interests. He seems, though a good man, to have been too much under the influence of a selfish and covetous spirit: and how many, alas! imperil the good of their souls for the prospect of worldly advantage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan,....

Consequently disputes arose between the two parties of herdsmen. The difficulty was increased by the fact that the Canaanites and Perizzites were then dwelling in the land, so that the space was very contracted. The Perizzites, who are mentioned here and in <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/1-4.htm">Judges 1:4</a>, along with the Canaanites, and who are placed in the other lists of the inhabitants of Canaan among the different Canaanitish tribes (<a href="/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/3-17.htm">Exodus 3:17</a>, etc.), are not mentioned among the descendants of Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-17</a>), and may therefore, like the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, and Rephaim (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>), not have been descendants of Ham at all. The common explanation of the name Perizzite as equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; "inhabitant of the level ground" (<a href="/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>), is at variance not only with the form of the word, the inhabitant of the level ground being called &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497; (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>), but with the fact of their combination sometimes with the Canaanites, sometimes with the other tribes of Canaan, whose names were derived from their founders. Moreover, to explain the term "Canaanite," as denoting "the civilised inhabitants of towns," or "the trading Phoenicians," is just as arbitrary as if we were to regard the Kenites, Kenizzites, and the other tribes mentioned <a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>. along with the Canaanites, as all alike traders or inhabitants of towns. The origin of the name Perizzite is involved in obscurity, like that of the Kenites and other tribes settled in Canaan that were not descended from Ham. But we may infer from the frequency with which they are mentioned in connection with the Hamitic inhabitants of Canaan, that they were widely dispersed among the latter.
