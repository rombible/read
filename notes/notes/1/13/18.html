God will abundantly make up in spiritual peace, what we lose for preserving neighbourly peace. When our relations are separated from us, yet God is not. Observe also the promises with which God now comforted and enriched Abram. Of two things he assures him; a good land, and a numerous issue to enjoy it. The prospects seen by faith are more rich and beautiful than those we see around us. God bade him walk through the land, not to think of fixing in it, but expect to be always unsettled, and walking through it to a better Canaan. He built an altar, in token of his thankfulness to God. When God meets us with gracious promises, he expects that we should attend him with humble praises. In outward difficulties, it is very profitable for the true believer to mediate on the glorious inheritance which the Lord has for him at the last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abram obeys the voice of heaven. He moves his tent from the northern station, where he had parted with Lot, and encamps by the oaks of Mamre, an Amorite sheik. He loves the open country, as he is a stranger, and deals in flocks and herds. The oaks, otherwise rendered by Onkelos and the Vulgate "plains of Mamre," are said to be in Hebron, a place and town about twenty miles south of Jerusalem, on the way to Beersheba. It is a town of great antiquity, having been built seven years before Zoan (Tanis) in Egypt <a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>. It was sometimes called Mamre in Abram's time, from his confederate of that name. It was also named Kiriath Arba, the city of Arba, a great man among the Anakim <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-14</a>. But upon being taken by Kaleb it recovered the name of Hebron. It is now el-Khulil (the friend, that is, of God; a designation of Abram). The variety of name indicates variety of masters; first, a Shemite it may be, then the Amorites, then the Hittites <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>, then the Anakim, then Judah, and lastly the Muslims.<p>A third altar is here built by Abram. His wandering course requires a varying place of worship. It is the Omnipresent One whom he adores. The previous visits of the Lord had completed the restoration of his inward peace, security, and liberty of access to God, which had been disturbed by his descent to Egypt, and the temptation that had overcome him there. He feels himself again at peace with God, and his fortitude is renewed. He grows in spiritual knowledge and practice under the great Teacher. <p> - Abram Rescues Lot<p>1. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500;  'amra&#772;pel, Amraphel; related: unknown. &#1488;&#1500;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1498;  'aryo&#770;k, Ariok, "leonine?" related: &#1488;&#1512;&#1497;  'ar&#305;&#770;y, "a lion:" a name re-appearing in the time of Daniel Dan 2:14. &#1488;&#1500;&#1505;&#1512;  'ela&#772;sa&#772;r Ellasar (related: unknown) is identified with Larsa or Larancha, the &#x39b;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;  Larissa or &#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  Laracho&#772;n of the Greeks, now Senkereh, a town of lower Babylonia, between Mugheir (Ur) and Warka (Erek) on the left bank of the Frat. &#1499;&#1491;&#1512;&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1512;  keda&#772;rla&#772;&#8219;omer, Kedorla'omer, was compared by Col.

Indeed such superstitions might take their rise from hence, being improved and abused to such purposes; and both Jerom (f) and Sozomen (g) speak of the oak of Abram being there in the times of Constantine, and greatly resorted to, and had in great veneration; and they and others make mention of a turpentine tree, which it is pretended sprung from a walking stick of one of the angels that appeared to Abram at this place, greatly regarded in a superstitious way by all sorts of persons: this plain or grove of oaks, here spoken of, was called after a man whose name was Mamre, an Amorite, a friend and confederate of Abram: <p>which is in Hebron; or near it, an ancient city built seven years before Zoan or Tanis in Egypt, <a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>; it was first called Kirjath Arbab, but, in the times of Moses, Hebron, <a href="/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>.

For previous to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, this whole country was well watered, "as the garden of Jehovah," the garden planted by Jehovah in paradise, and "as Egypt," the land rendered so fertile by the overflowing of the Nile, "in the direction of Zoar." Abram therefore remained in the land of Canaan, whilst Lot settled in the cities of the plain of the Jordan, and tented (pitched his tents) as far as Sodom. In anticipation of the succeeding history (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>), it is mentioned here (<a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>), that the inhabitants of Sodom were very wicked, and sinful before Jehovah. </body></html>
