It is well to observe the deaths of others. They all lived very long; not one of them died till he had seen almost eight hundred years, and some of them lived much longer; a great while for an immortal soul to be prisoned in a house of clay. The present life surely was not to them such a burden as it commonly is now, else they would have been weary of it. Nor was the future life so clearly revealed then, as it now under the gospel, else they would have been urgent to remove to it. All the patriarchs that lived before the flood, except Noah, were born before Adam died. From him they might receive a full account of the creation, the fall, the promise, and the Divine precepts about religious worship and a religious life. Thus God kept up in his church the knowledge of his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the compass of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3-5</a> the course of Adam's life is completed. And after the same model the lines of all his lineal descendants in this chapter are drawn up. The certain particulars stated are the years he lived before the birth of a certain son, the number of years he afterward lived during which sons and daughters were born to him, and his death. Two sons, and most probably several daughters, were born to Adam before the birth of Sheth. But these sons have been already noticed, and the line of Noah is here given. It is obvious, therefore, that the following individuals in the genealogy may, or may not, have been first-born sons. The stated formula, "and he died," at the close of each life except that of Henok, is a standing demonstration of the effect of disobedience.<p>The writer, according to custom, completes the life of one patriarch before he commences that of the next; and so the first event of the following biography is long antecedent to the last event of the preceding one. This simply and clearly illustrates the law of Hebrew narrative.<p>The only peculiarity in the life of Adam is the statement that his son was "in his likeness, after his image." This is no doubt intended to include that depravity which had become the characteristic of fallen man. It is contrasted with the preceding notice that Adam was originally created in the image of God. If it had been intended merely to indicate that the offspring was of the same species with the parent, the phrase, "after his kind" (&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;  lem&#305;&#770;yna&#770;h, would have been employed, as in the first chapter. This is one of the mysteries of the race, when the head of it is a moral being, and has fallen. His moral depravity, affecting the essential difference of his nature, descends to his offspring.<p>As this document alludes to the first in the words, "in the day of God's creating man, in the likeness of God made he him," quotes its very words in the sentence, "male and female created he them, refers to the second in the words, and called their name man" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, and also needs this second for the explication of the statement that the offspring of man bore his likeness, it presupposes the existence and knowledge of these documents at the time when it was written. If it had been intended for an independent work, it would have been more full and explanatory on these important topics.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. all the days &#8230; Adam lived&#8212;The most striking feature in this catalogue is the longevity of Adam and his immediate descendants. Ten are enumerated (Ge 5:5-32) in direct succession whose lives far exceed the ordinary limits with which we are familiar&#8212;the shortest being three hundred sixty-five, [Ge 5:23] and the longest nine hundred sixty-nine years [Ge 5:27]. It is useless to inquire whether and what secondary causes may have contributed to this protracted longevity&#8212;vigorous constitutions, the nature of their diet, the temperature and salubrity of the climate; or, finally&#8212;as this list comprises only the true worshippers of God&#8212;whether their great age might be owing to the better government of their passions and the quiet, even tenor of their lives. Since we cannot obtain satisfactory evidence on these points, it is wise to resolve the fact into the sovereign will of God. We can, however, trace some of the important uses to which, in the early economy of Providence, it was subservient. It was the chief means of reserving a knowledge of God, of the great truths of religion, as well as the influence of genuine piety. So that, as their knowledge was obtained by tradition, they would be in a condition to preserve it in the greatest purity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No notes from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Enos lived, after he begat Cainan, eight hundred and fifteen years,....

The begetting of the son by whom the line was perpetuated (no doubt in every case the first-born), is followed by an account of the number of years that Adam and the other fathers lived after that, by the statement that each one begat (other) sons and daughters, by the number of years that he lived altogether, and lastly, by the assertion &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; "and he died." This apparently superfluous announcement is "intended to indicate by its constant recurrence that death reigned from Adam downwards as an unchangeable law (vid., <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>). But against this background of universal death, the power of life was still more conspicuous. For the man did not die till he had propagated life, so that in the midst of the death of individuals the life of the race was preserved, and the hope of the seed sustained, by which the author of death should be overcome." In the case of one of the fathers indeed, viz., Enoch (<a href="/genesis/5-21.htm">Genesis 5:21</a>.), life had not only a different issue, but also a different form. Instead of the expression "and he lived," which introduces in every other instance the length of life after the birth of the first-born, we find in the case of Enoch this statement, "he walked with God (Elohim);" and instead of the expression "and he died," the announcement, "and he was not, for God (Elohim) took him." The phrase "walked with God," which is only applied to Enoch and Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>), denotes the most confidential intercourse, the closest communion with the personal God, a walking as it were by the side of God, who still continued His visible intercourse with men (vid., <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). It must be distinguished from "walking before God" (<a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-40.htm">Genesis 24:40</a>, etc.), and "walking after God" (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-4.htm">Deuteronomy 13:4</a>), both which phrases are used to indicate a pious, moral, blameless life under the law according to the directions of the divine commands. The only other passage in which this expression "walk with God" occurs is <a href="//biblehub.com/malachi/2-6.htm">Malachi 2:6</a>, where it denotes not the piety of the godly Israelites generally, but the conduct of the priests, who stood in a closer relation to Jehovah under the Old Testament than the rest of the faithful, being permitted to enter the Holy Place, and hold direct intercourse with Him there, which the rest of the people could not do. The article in &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; gives prominence to the personality of Elohim, and shows that the expression cannot refer to intercourse with the spiritual world.<p>In Enoch, the seventh from Adam through Seth, godliness attained its highest point; whilst ungodliness culminated in Lamech, the seventh from Adam through Cain, who made his sword his god. Enoch, therefore, like Elijah, was taken away by God, and carried into the heavenly paradise, so that he did not see (experience) death (<a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a>); i.e., he was taken up from this temporal life and transfigured into life eternal, being exempted by God from the law of death and of return to the dust, as those of the faithful will be, who shall be alive at the coming of Christ to judgment, and who in like manner shall not taste of death and corruption, but be changed in a moment. There is no foundation for the opinion, that Enoch did not participate at his translation in the glorification which awaits the righteous at the resurrection. For, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>, it is not in glorification, but in the resurrection, that Christ is the first-fruits. Now the latter presupposes death. Whoever, therefore, through the grace of God is exempted from death, cannot rise from the dead, but reaches &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, or the glorified state of perfection, through being "changed" or "clothed upon" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>). This does not at all affect the truth of the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>. For the same God who has appointed death as the wages of sin, and given us, through Christ, the victory over death, possesses the power to glorify into eternal life an Enoch and an Elijah, and all who shall be alive at the coming of the Lord without chaining their glorification to death and resurrection. Enoch and Elijah were translated into eternal life with God without passing through disease, death, and corruption, for the consolation of believers, and to awaken the hope of a life after death. Enoch's translation stands about half way between Adam and the flood, in the 987th year after the creation of Adam. Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, and Jared were still alive. His son Methuselah and his grandson Lamech were also living, the latter being 113 years old. Noah was not yet born, and Adam was dead. His translation, in consequence of his walking with God, was "an example of repentance to all generations," as the son of Sirach says (Ecclus. 44:16); and the apocryphal legend in the book of Enoch <a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a> represents him as prophesying of the coming of the Lord, to execute judgment upon the ungodly (Jde 1:14-15). In comparison with the longevity of the other fathers, Enoch was taken away young, before he had reached half the ordinary age, as a sign that whilst long life, viewed as a time for repentance and grace, is indeed a blessing from God, when the ills which have entered the world through sin are considered, it is also a burden and trouble which God shortens for His chosen. That the patriarchs of the old world felt the ills of this earthly life in all their severity, was attested by Lamech (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/5-28.htm">Genesis 5:28</a>, <a href="/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>), when he gave his son, who was born 69 years after Enoch's translation, the name of Noah, saying, "This same shall comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed." Noah, &#1504;&#1493;&#1495; from &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; to rest and &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; to bring rest, is explained by &#1504;&#1495;&#1501; to comfort, in the sense of helpful and remedial consolation. Lamech not only felt the burden of his work upon the ground which God had cursed, but looked forward with a prophetic presentiment to the time when the existing misery and corruption would terminate, and a change for the better, a redemption from the curse, would come. This presentiment assumed the form of hope when his son was born; he therefore gave expression to it in his name. But his hope was not realized, at least not in the way that he desired. A change did indeed take place in the lifetime of Noah. By the judgment of the flood the corrupt race was exterminated, and in Noah, who was preserved because of his blameless walk with God, the restoration of the human race was secured; but the effects of the curse, though mitigated, were not removed; whilst a covenant sign guaranteed the preservation of the human race, and therewith, by implication, his hope of the eventual removal of the curse (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-8.htm">Genesis 9:8-17</a>).<p>The genealogical table breaks off with Noah; all that is mentioned with reference to him being the birth of his three sons, when he was 500 years old (<a href="/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>; see <a href="/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10</a>), without any allusion to the remaining years of his life-an indication of a later hand. "The mention of three sons leads to the expectation, that whereas hitherto the line has been perpetuated through one member alone, in the future each of the three sons will form a new beginning (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-18.htm">Genesis 9:18-19</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-1.htm">Genesis 10:1</a>)." - M. Baumgarten. </body></html>
