No more is said, but that is enough. Reuben thought that his father would never hear of it; but those that promise themselves secrecy in sin, are generally disappointed. The age and death of Isaac are recorded, though he died not till after Joseph was sold into Egypt. Isaac lived about forty years after he had made his will, chap. 27:2. We shall not die an hour the sooner, but much the better, for timely setting our hearts and houses in order. Particular notice is taken of the agreement of Esau and Jacob at their father's funeral, to show how God had wonderfully changed Esau's mind. It is awful to behold relations, sometimes for a little of this world's goods, disputing over the graves of their friends, while they are near going to the grave themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/35.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob's return and his father's death. The family of Jacob is now enumerated, because it has been completed by the birth of Benjamin. "In Padan-aram." This applies to all of them but Benjamin; an exception which the reader of the context can make for himself. Jacob at length arrives with his whole establishment at Hebron, the third notable station occupied by Abraham in the land <a href="/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>. Here also his father sojourns. The life of Isaac is now closed. Joseph must have been, at the time of Jacob's return, in his thirteenth year, and therefore, his father in his hundred and fourth. Isaac was consequently in his hundred and sixty-third year. He survived the return of Jacob to Hebron about seventeen years, and the sale of Joseph his grandson about thirteen. "Esau and Jacob his sons buried him." Hence, we learn that Esau and Jacob continued to be on brotherly terms from the day of their meeting at the ford of Jabbok.<p>This chapter closes the ninth of the pieces or documents marked off by the phrase "these are the generations." Its opening event was the birth of Isaac <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm">Genesis 25:19</a>, which took place in the hundreth year of Abraham, and therefore, seventy-five years before his death recorded in the seventh document. As the seventh purports to be the generations of Terah <a href="/genesis/11-27.htm">Genesis 11:27</a> and relates to Abraham who was his offspring, so the present document, containing the generations of Isaac, refers chiefly to the sons of Isaac, and especially to Jacob, as the heir of promise. Isaac as a son learned obedience to his father in that great typical event of his life, in which he was laid on the altar, and figuratively sacrificed in the ram which was his substitute. This was the great significant passage in his life, after which he retires into comparative tranquillity. <p> - Section XII - Jacob<p> - The History of Esau<p>2. &lt;&#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1489;&#1502;&#1492;  'oho&#774;l&#305;&#770;yba&#770;ma&#770;h, Oholibamah, "tent of the high place." &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#780;na&#770;h, 'Anah, "answering." &#1510;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;  ts&#305;&#770;b&#8219;o&#770;n, Tsib'on, "dyer, colored."<p>4. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1508;&#1494;  'e&#780;l&#305;&#770;yphaz, Eliphaz, "God of strength." &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;  re&#8219;u&#770;'e&#770;l Re'uel, "friend of God."<p>5. &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;  ye&#8219;u&#770;sh, Je'ush, "haste." &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501;  ya&#8219;la&#770;m, Ja'lam, "hiding." &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;  qo&#770;rach Qorach, "ice."<p>11. &#1514;&#1497;&#1502;&#1503;  te&#770;yma&#770;n, Teman, "right-hand man." &#1488;&#1493;&#1502;&#1512;  'o&#770;ma&#772;r, Omar, "eloquent." &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;  tsepho&#770;, Tsepho, "watch." &#1490;&#1506;&#1514;&#1501;  ga&#8219;ta&#770;m Ga'tam, "touch." &#1511;&#1504;&#1494;  qenaz Qenaz, "hunting."<p>12. &#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506;  t&#305;&#770;mna&#770;( Timna', "restraint." &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1511;  &#8219;a&#780;ma&#770;le&#770;q, 'Amaleq, "licking up, laboring."<p>13. &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  nachath, Nachath, "going down, rest." &#1494;&#1512;&#1495;  zerach, Zerach, "rising" (of light). &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1495;  shamma&#770;h, Shammah, "wasting." &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;zza&#770;h, Mizzah, "fear, sprinkling."<p>20. &#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1503;  lo&#770;t&#803;a&#770;n, Lotan, "covering, veiled." &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;  sho&#770;ba&#770;l, Shobal, "flowing, a shoot."<p>21. &#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;  d&#305;&#770;ysho&#770;n, Dishon, "a kind of gazelle, fat." &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;  'etser, Etser, "store." &#1491;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;  d&#305;&#770;ysha&#770;n, Dishan, "threshing."<p>22. &#1495;&#1512;&#1497;  cho&#770;r&#305;&#770;y, Chori, "troglodyte." &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1501;  he&#772;ma&#772;m, Hemam, "noise, commotion."<p>23. &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;  &#8219;alva&#770;n, 'Alvan, "lofty." &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1514;  ma&#770;nachath, Manachath, "rest." &#1506;&#1497;&#1489;&#1500;  &#8219;e&#770;yba&#770;l, 'Ebal, "stripped of leaves." &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;  shepho&#770;, Shepho, "bare." &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;  'o&#770;na&#770;m, Onam, "strong."<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 35:28, 29.

He was therefore 120 when Joseph was promoted at the age of 30, and 107 when Joseph was sold; consequently Isaac was 167 years of age when Joseph was sold, so that he must have survived that event and sympathized with Jacob his son for a period of 13 years. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/35.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jacob's Return to His Father's House, and Death of Isaac. - Jacob had left his father's house with no other possession than a staff, and now he returned with 12 sons.
