It is a great mercy to be stopped in a sinful way, either by conscience or by providence. Whence comest thou? Consider that thou art running from duty, and the privileges thou wast blest with in Abram's tent. It is good to live in a religious family, which those ought to consider who have this advantage. Whither wilt thou go? Thou art running into sin; if Hagar return to Egypt, she will return to idol gods, and into danger in the wilderness through which she must travel. Recollecting who we are, would often teach us our duty. Inquiring whence we came, would show us our sin and folly. Considering whither we shall go, discovers our danger and misery. And those who leave their space and duty, must hasten their return, how mortifying soever it be. The declaration of the Angel, I will, shows this Angel was the eternal Word and Son of God. Hagar could not but admire the Lord's mercy, and feel, Have I, who am so unworthy, been favoured with a gracious visit from the Lord? She was brought to a better temper, returned, and by her behaviour softened Sarai, and received more gentle treatment. Would that we were always suitably impressed with this thought, Thou God seest me!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God of my vision - (El-roi).

There the angel of the Lord found her by a well, and directed her to return to her mistress, and submit to her; at the same time he promised her the birth of a son, and an innumerable multiplication of her descendants. As the fruit of her womb was the seed of Abram, she was to return to his house and there bear him a son, who, though not the seed promised by God, would be honoured for Abram's sake with the blessing of an innumerable posterity. For this reason also Jehovah appeared to her in the form of the Angel of Jehovah. &#1492;&#1512;&#1492; is adj. verb. as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38-24.htm">Genesis 38:24</a>, etc.: "thou art with child and wilt bear;" &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468; for &#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1514; (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) is found again in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>, <a href="/judges/13-7.htm">Judges 13:7</a>. This son she was to call Ishmael ("God hears"), "for Jehovah hath hearkened to thy distress." &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; afflictionem sine dubio vocat, quam Hagar afflictionem sentiebat esse, nempe conditionem servitem et quod castigata esset a Sara (Luther). It was Jehovah, not Elohim, who had heard, although the latter name was most naturally suggested as the explanation of Ishmael, because the hearing, i.e., the multiplication of Ishmael's descendants, was the result of the covenant grace of Jehovah. Moreover, in contrast with the oppression which has had endured and still would endure, she received the promise that her son would endure no such oppression. "He will be a wild ass of a man." The figure of a &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, onager, that wild and untameable animal, roaming at its will in the desert, of which so highly poetic a description is given in <a href="//biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5-8</a>, depicts most aptly "the Bedouin's boundless love of freedom as he rides about in the desert, spear in hand, upon his camel or his horse, hardy, frugal, revelling in the varied beauty of nature, and despising town life in every form;" and the words, "his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him," describe most truly the incessant state of feud, in which the Ishmaelites live with one another or with their neighbours. "He will dwell before the face of all his brethren." &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500; denotes, it is true, to the east of (cf. <a href="/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>), and this meaning is to be retained here; but the geographical notice of the dwelling-place of the Ishmaelites hardly exhausts the force of the expression, which also indicated that Ishmael would maintain an independent standing before (in the presence of) all the descendants of Abraham. History has confirmed this promise. The Ishmaelites have continued to this day in free and undiminished possession of the extensive peninsula between the Euphrates, the Straits of Suez, and the Red Sea, from which they have overspread both Northern Africa and Southern Asia. </body></html>
