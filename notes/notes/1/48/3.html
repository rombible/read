If the Lord please, it is very desirable to bear our dying testimony to his truth, to his faithfulness, and the pleasantness of his ways. And one would wish so to live, as to give energy and weight to our dying exhortations. All true believers are blessed at their death, but all do not depart equally full of spiritual consolations. Jacob adopted Joseph's two sons. Let them not succeed their father, in his power and grandeur in Egypt; but let them succeed in the inheritance of the promise made to Abraham. Thus the aged dying patriarch teaches these young persons to take their lot with the people of God. He appoints each of them to be the head of a tribe. Those are worthy of double honour, who, through God's grace, break through the temptations of worldly wealth and preferment, to embrace religion in disgrace and poverty. Jacob will have Ephraim and Manasseh to know, that it is better to be low, and in the church, than high, and out of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After these things. - After the arrangements concerning the funeral, recorded in the chapter. "Menasseh and Ephraim." They seem to have accompanied their father from respectful affection to their aged relative. "Israel strengthened himself" - summoned his remaining powers for the interview, which was now to him an effort. "God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz." From the terms of the blessing received it is evident that Jacob here refers to the last appearance of God to him at Bethel <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>. "And now thy sons." After referring to the promise of a numerous offspring, and of a territory which they are to inherit, he assigns to each of the two sons of Joseph, who were born in Egypt, a place among his own sons, and a separate share in the promised land. In this way two shares fall to Joseph. "And thy issue." We are not informed whether Joseph had any other sons. But all such are to be reckoned in the two tribes of which Ephraim and Menasseh are the heads. These young men are now at least twenty and nineteen years of age, as they were born before the famine commenced. Any subsequent issue that Joseph might have, would be counted among the generations of their children. "Rachel died upon me" - as a heavy affliction falling upon me. The presence of Joseph naturally leads the father's thoughts to Rachel, the beloved mother of his beloved son, whose memory he honors in giving a double portion to her oldest son.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4.

He then sent for Joseph, as he felt that his death was approaching; and having requested him, as a mark of love and faithfulness, not to bury him in Egypt, but near his fathers in Canaan, he made him assure him on oath (by putting his hand under his hip, vid., p. 164) that his wishes should be fulfilled. When Joseph had taken this oath, "Israel bowed (in worship) upon the bed's head." He had talked with Joseph while sitting upon the bed; and when Joseph had promised to fulfil his wish, he turned towards the head of the bed, so as to lie with his face upon the bed, and thus worshipped God, thanking Him for granting his wish, which sprang from living faith in the promises of God; just as David also worshipped upon his bed (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47-48</a>). The Vulgate rendering is correct: adoravit Deum conversus ad lectuli caput. That of the lxx, on the contrary, is &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bb; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (i.e., &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;); and the Syriac and Itala have the same (cf. <a href="/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a>). But no fitting sense can be obtained from this rendering, unless we think of the staff with which Jacob had gone through life, and, taking &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; therefore in the sense of &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, assume that Jacob made use of the staff to enable him to sit upright in bed, and so prayed, bent upon or over it, though even then the expression &#1492;&#1502;&#1496;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; remains a strange one; so that unquestionably this rendering arose from a false reading of &#1492;&#1502;&#1496;&#1492;, and is not proved to be correct by the quotation in <a href="/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a>.
