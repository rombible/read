Joseph says, They are my sons whom God has given me. Jacob says, God hath showed me thy seed. Comforts are doubly sweet to us when we see them coming from God's hand. He not only prevents our fears, but exceeds our hopes. Jacob mentions the care the Divine providence had taken of him all his days. A great deal of hardship he had known in his time, but God kept him from the evil of his troubles. Now he was dying, he looked upon himself as redeemed from all sin and sorrow for ever. Christ, the Angel of the covenant, redeems from all evil. Deliverances from misery and dangers, by the Divine power, coming through the ransom of the blood of Christ, in Scripture are often called redemption. In blessing Joseph's sons, Jacob crossed hands. Joseph was willing to support his first-born, and would have removed his father's hands. But Jacob acted neither by mistake, nor from a partial affection to one more than the other; but from a spirit of prophecy, and by the Divine counsel. God, in bestowing blessings upon his people, gives more to some than to others, more gifts, graces, and comforts, and more of the good things of this life. He often gives most to those that are least likely. He chooses the weak things of the world; he raises the poor out of the dust. Grace observes not the order of nature, nor does God prefer those whom we think fittest to be preferred, but as it pleases him. How poor are they who have no riches but those of this world! How miserable is a death-bed to those who have no well-grounded hope of good, but dreadful apprehensions of evil, and nothing but evil for ever!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/48.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph presumes that his father has gone astray through dulness of perception, and endeavors to rectify his mistake. He finds, however, that on the other hand a supernatural vision is now conferred on his parent, who is fully conscious of what he is about, and therefore, abides by his own act. Ephraim is to be greater than Menasseh. Joshua, the successor of Moses, was of the tribe of Ephraim, as Kaleb his companion was of Judah. Ephraim came to designate the northern kingdom of the ten tribes, as Judah denoted the southern kingdom containing the remaining tribes; and each name was occasionally used to denote all Israel, with a special reference to the prominent part. "His seed shall be the fullness of the nations." This denotes not only the number but the completeness of his race, and accords with the future pre-eminence of his tribe. In thee, in Joseph, who is still identified with his offspring.<p>At the point of death Jacob expresses his assurance of the return of his posterity to the land of promise, and bestows on Joseph one share or piece of ground above his brethren, which, says he, I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. This share is, in the original, &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501;  shekem, Shekem, a shoulder or tract of land. This region included "the parcel of the field where he had spread his tent" <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>. It refers to the whole territory of Shekem, which was conquered by his sword and his bow, inasmuch as the city itself was sacked, and its inhabitants put to the sword by his sons at the head of his armed retainers, though without his approval <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>. Though he withdrew immediately after to Bethel <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35.htm">Genesis 35</a>, yet he neither fled nor relinquished possession of this conquest, as we find his sons feeding his flocks there when he himself was residing at Hebron <a href="/genesis/37-13.htm">Genesis 37:13</a>. The incidental conquest of such a tract was no more at variance with the subsequent acquisition of the whole country than the purchase of a field by Abraham or a parcel of ground by Jacob himself. In accordance with this gift Joseph's bones were deposited in Shekem, after the conquest of the whole land by returning Israel. The territory of Shekem was probably not equal in extent to that of Ephraim, but was included within its bounds. <p> - Jacob Blesses His Sons<p>5. &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;&#1492;  meke&#770;ra&#772;h, "weapon;" related: &#1499;&#1497;&#1512;  ka&#772;rar or &#1499;&#1512;&#1492;  ka&#772;ra&#772;h dig.

This word occurs in six other places - <a href="/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-21.htm">Deuteronomy 33:21</a>; Jud.

The meaning "sceptre" is therefore doubtful. &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;  sh&#305;&#770;ylo&#770;h, Shiloh, a softened form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;  sh&#305;&#770;ylo&#770;n, a derivative of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;  shol, the ultimate root of &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;  sha&#772;la&#770;h, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501;  sha&#772;lam, and possibly &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496;  sha&#772;lat&#803;, and hence, denoting "the peacemaker, the prince of peace." It is not employed as an appellative noun. But it is used afterward as the name of a town, now identified as Seilun. This town probably had its name, like many other ancient places from a person of the same name who built or possessed it.<p>From the special conference with Joseph we now pass to the parting address of Jacob to his assembled sons. This is at the same time prophetic and benedictory. Like all prophecy, it starts from present things, and in its widest expanse penetrates into the remotest future of the present course of nature.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/48.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.
