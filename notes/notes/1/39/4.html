But it may be asked how this could be, since Joseph understood not the Egyptian language? In answer to which it may be observed, that, undoubtedly, as soon as he came thither he would do his utmost to obtain the knowledge of that language, and being a person of good parts, would soon obtain it, especially as there was a great affinity between that language and his own. Besides, it is not to be supposed that Joseph was highly advanced at once, but step by step, and after some considerable time. For, considering Potiphar’s office and station, it is not likely that he would thus prefer Joseph till he had had full evidence of his fidelity, as well as of his ability to manage so great a trust.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/39.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>39:1-6 Our enemies may strip us of outward distinctions and ornaments; but wisdom and grace cannot be taken from us. They may separate us from friends, relatives, and country; but they cannot take from us the presence of the Lord. They may shut us from outward blessings, rob us of liberty, and confine us in dungeons; but they cannot shut us out from communion with God, from the throne of grace, or take from us the blessings of salvation. Joseph was blessed, wonderfully blessed, even in the house where he was a slave. God's presence with us, makes all we do prosperous. Good men are the blessings of the place where they live; good servants may be so, though mean and lightly esteemed. The prosperity of the wicked is, one way or other, for the sake of the godly.

Egyptian monuments attest the existence of such an officer in wealthy houses at an early period; a tomb at Kum-el-Ahmar exhibiting the account books, writing materials, and clerks that pertain to the office of s steward, and another at Beni-hassan, besides displaying his accustomed implements, styling him the Overseer (Wilkinson's 'Ancient Egyptians, vol. 1. p. 372, ed. 1878; Hengstenberg s 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 24).
