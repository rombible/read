Those that have broken the bonds of modesty, will never be held by the bonds of truth. It is no new thing for the best of men to be falsely accused of the worst of crimes, by those who themselves are the worst of criminals.

"To do his business." He does not come in her way except at the call of duty. He hath brought in. She either does not condescend, or does not need to name her husband. "A Hebrew to mock us." Her disappointment now provokes her to falsehood as the means of concealment and revenge. A Hebrew is still the only national designation proper to Joseph <a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>. Jacob's descendants had not got beyond the family. The term Israelite was therefore, not yet in use. The national name is designedly used as a term of reproach among the Egyptians <a href="/genesis/43-32.htm">Genesis 43:32</a>. "To mock us," - to take improper liberties, not only with me, but with any of the females in the house. "I cried with a loud voice."

He (Potiphar) was not greater in that house than he, and had given everything over to him except her, because she was his wife. "How could he so abuse this confidence, as to do this great wickedness and sin against God!" </body></html>
