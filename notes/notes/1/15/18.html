It is probable that this furnace and lamp, which passed between the pieces, burned and consumed them, and so completed the sacrifice, and testified God's acceptance of it. So it intimates that God's covenants with man are made by sacrifice, Ps 50:5. And we may know that he accepts our sacrifices, if he kindles in our souls pious and devout affections. The bounds of the land granted are stated. Several nations, or tribes, are spoken of, that must be cast out to make room for the seed of Abram. In this chapter we perceive in Abram faith struggling against, and triumphing over, unbelief. Wonder not, believers, if you meet with seasons of darkness and distress. But it is not the will of God that you should be cast down: fear not; for all that he was to Abram he will be to you.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In that instant the covenant was solemnly completed.

Take me an heifer, &c.&#8212;On occasions of great importance, when two or more parties join in a compact, they either observe precisely the same rites as Abram did, or, where they do not, they invoke the lamp as their witness. According to these ideas, which have been from time immemorial engraven on the minds of Eastern people, the Lord Himself condescended to enter into covenant with Abram. The patriarch did not pass between the sacrifice and the reason was that in this transaction he was bound to nothing. He asked a sign, and God was pleased to give him a sign, by which, according to Eastern ideas, He bound Himself. In like manner God has entered into covenant with us; and in the glory of the only-begotten Son, who passed through between God and us, all who believe have, like Abram, a sign or pledge in the gift of the Spirit, whereby they may know that they shall inherit the heavenly Canaan.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto thy seed have I given this land, </span> i.e. decreed and promised in due time to give, which makes it as sure as if it were actually given to them.

Brocardus (s) says,"from Delta to Heliopolis were three miles, where another river was separated from the Nile, and carried to the city of Pelusium; and, adds he, this river is properly called in Scripture the river of Egypt, and at it is bounded the lot of the tribe of Judah.''This river of Egypt, or the Nile, was the southern boundary of the land of Canaan, and from hence to the river Euphrates, the eastern boundary, was the utmost extent of it in which it was ever possessed, as it was in the times of David and Solomon, <a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a>. <p>(p) Odyss. 14. vid.

The northern capital of their empire was Carchemish, about sixteen miles south of the modern Birejik; and the southern Kadesh, on an island of the Orontes (Prof. Sayce in 'Frazer's Magazine,' August, 1880, art.

The vision here passes into a prophetic sleep produced by God. In this sleep there fell upon Abram dread and darkness; this is shown by the interchange of the perfect &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; and the participle &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1514;. The reference to the time is intended to show "the supernatural character of the darkness and sleep, and the distinction between the vision and a dream" (O. v. Gerlach). It also possesses a symbolical meaning. The setting of the sun prefigured to Abram the departure of the sun of grace, which shone upon Israel, and the commencement of a dark and dreadful period of suffering for his posterity, the very anticipation of which involved Abram in darkness. For the words which he heard in the darkness were these (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>.): "Know of a surety, that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them (the lords of the strange land), and they (the foreigners) shall oppress them 400 years." That these words had reference to the sojourn of the children of Israel in Egypt, is placed beyond all doubt by the fulfilment. The 400 years were, according to prophetic language, a round number for the 430 years that Israel spent in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>). "Also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge (see the fulfilment, <a href="/exodus/6-11.htm">Exodus 6:11</a>); and afterward shall they come out with great substance (the actual fact according to <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-36</a>). And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-7.htm">Genesis 25:7-8</a>); and in the fourth generation they shall come hither again." The calculations are made here on the basis of a hundred years to a generation: not too much for those times, when the average duration of life was above 150 years, and Isaac was born in the hundredth year of Abraham's life. "For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full." Amorite, the name of the most powerful tribe of the Canaanites, is used here as the common name of all the inhabitants of Canaan, just as in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a> (cf. <a href="/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a>), <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/6-10.htm">Judges 6:10</a>, etc.).<p>By this revelation Abram had the future history of his seed pointed out to him in general outlines, and was informed at the same time why neither he nor his descendants could obtain immediate possession of the promised land, viz., because the Canaanites were not yet ripe for the sentence of extermination. </body></html>
