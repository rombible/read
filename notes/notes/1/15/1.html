The revelation on this occasion is made by night (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a>), not however in a dream, but in a trance, in which the senses of Abram were closed to all earthly impressions and he became passive in the hands of the Almighty. Up to this time Abram had received only general promises of offspring, and of the land being the possession of his seed; but years were passing by, and the fulfilment of his hopes remained distant as ever. By the war with the Elamite king he had also made for himself powerful enemies; and though the immediate result was fortunate, yet many Canaanite nations may have witnessed with displeasure so remarkable an exhibition of the power and energy of an “immigrant.” And thus the time had come when the patriarch needed and obtained more formal assurances, first, of the bestowal upon him of offspring (<a href="/context/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1-6</a>), and, secondly, of the future possession of Palestine (<a href="/context/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/genesis/15.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Genesis<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE WORD THAT SCATTERS FEAR<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Abram was now apparently about eighty-five years old. He had been fourteen years in Palestine, and had, for the only time in his life, quite recently been driven to have recourse to arms against a formidable league of northern kings, whom, after a swift forced march from the extreme south to the extreme north of the land, he had defeated. He might well fear attack from their overwhelmingly superior forces. So this vision, like all God’s words, fits closely to moments needs, but is also for all time and all men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1. The call to conquer fear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Fear not.-{<span class="ital">a</span>} There is abundant reason for fear in facts of life. There are so many certain evils, and so many possible evils, that any man who is not a feather-brained fool must sometimes quail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">b</span>} Reasons for fear in our relations to divine law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">c</span>} The only rational way of conquering fears is by showing them to be unfounded. It is waste of breath to say, Don’t be afraid, and to do nothing to remove the occasions of fear. It is childish to try to get rid of fears by shutting the eyes tight and refusing to look formidable facts in the face.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">d</span>} The revelation of God is the true antidote to fear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">e</span>} ‘Fear not’ is the characteristic word of divine revelation. It is of frequent occurrence from Abraham till John in Patmos.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2. The ground of the call in the Revelation of God as Shield.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>{<span class="ital">a</span>} As to outward evils, His protection assures us, not of absolute exemption, but of His entire control of them, so that men and circumstances are His instruments, and His will only is powerful. Chedorlaomer and all the allied kings are nothing; ‘a noise,’ as the prophet said of a later conqueror. All the bitterness and terror is taken out of evil. If any fiery dart pass through the shield, all its poison is wiped off in passage. So there remains no reason for fear, since all things work together for good. Behind that shield we are safe as diver in his bell, though seas rave and sea-monsters swim around.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">b</span>} As to inward evils, our Shield assures us of absolute exemption. ‘Shield of faith.’ Faith is shield because it takes hold of God’s strength.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3. The ground of the call in the Revelation of God as Reward.</span> Abraham had refused all share in booty, a large sacrifice, and here he is promised, A Reward in God, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> He gives Himself in recompense for all sacrifices in path of duty. ‘The Lord is able to give thee much more than these.’ This promise opens out to general truth that God Himself is the true reward of a devout life. There are many recompenses for all sacrifices for God, some of them outward and material, some of them inward and spiritual, but the reward which surpasses all others is that by such sacrifices we attain to greater capacity for God, and therefore possess more of Him. This is the only Reward worth thinking of-God only satisfies the soul. With Him we are rich; without Him poor; ‘exceeding great’-’riches in glory,’ transcending all measure. The revelations of God as Shield and Reward are both given in reference to the present life, but the former applies only to earth, where ‘without are fighters, within are fears’; while ‘the latter is mainly true for heaven, where those who have fought, having God for their Shield, will possess Him for their Reward, in a measure and manner which will make all earthly experiences seem poor. Here the ‘heirs of God’ get subsistence money, which is a small instalment of their inheritance; there they enter into possession of it all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Many years have passed since Abram was called to go forth from his father’s house, assured that God would make of him a great nation. They had been years of growing power. He has been dwelling at Mamre, as a prince among the people of the land, a power. There sweeps down on Southern Palestine the earliest of those invasions from the vast plains of the North which afterwards for generations were the standing dread of Abram’s descendants. Like the storm pillars in their own deserts, are these wild marauders with the wild names that never appear again in the history. Down on the rich valleys and peaceful pasture lands they swoop for booty, not for conquest. Like some sea-bird, they snatch their prey and away. They carry with them among the long train of captives Abram’s ungenerous brother-in-law, Lot. Then the friend of God, the father of the faithful, musters his men, like an Arab sheikh as he was, and swiftly follows the track of the marauders over the hills of Samaria, and across the plain of Jezreel. The night falls, and down he swoops upon them and scatters them. Coming back he had interviews with the King of Sodom, when he refuses to take any of the spoil, and with Melchizedek. Abram is back at Mamre. How natural that fear and depression should seize him: the reaction from high excitement; the dread that from the swarming East vengeance would come for his success in that night surprise; the thought that if it did, he was a wandering stranger in a strange land and could not count on allies. Then there would come, perhaps, the remembrance of how long God had delayed the very beginnings of the fulfilment, ‘Seeing I go childless.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To this mood of mind the divine vision is addressed. ‘Fear not-I am thy shield’ whatever force comes against thee, ‘and thine exceeding great reward,’-perhaps in reference to his refusal to take anything from the spoil. But God says this to us all. In these antique words the very loftiest and purest principles of spiritual religion are set forth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He that loves and trusts God possesses God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He that possesses God has enough for earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He that possesses God has enough for heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1. It is possible for a man to have God for his. ‘</span>I am thy Reward,’-not merely Rewarder, but Reward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How can one spiritual Being belong to another?-plainly, By mutual love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Gospel assures us of God’s love, and makes it possible for ours to be fixed on Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Faith gives us God for ours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The highest view of the blessings of the Gospel is that God Himself becomes our reward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How sad the insanity of men appears, in the ordinary aims of their life, its rewards and its objects of desire! How they chase after variety!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How much loftier and truer a conception of the blessing of religion this is than notions of mere escape and the like!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">2. The possession of God is enough for earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>God the all-sufficient object for our spirits, His love, the communication of Himself, the sense of His presence, the depths of His infinite character, of His wondrous ways, of His revealed Truth as an object for thought: of His authoritative will as imperative for will and conscience: aspiration towards Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God the Eternal Object.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> To find Him in everything, and everything in Him, is to be at rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This is what He promises-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Not a life of outward success and ease-much nobler than if He did.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Take Abram’s as a type.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In war He will be our Defence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In absence of other joys He will be Enough.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sphered and included in Him is all sweetness. He sustains all relations, and does for us what these other joys and goods partially do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The possession of His love should put away all fear, since having Him we are not at the mercy of externals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What, then, is Life as men ordinarily make it?-what a blunder!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3. To possess God is enough for heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Such a relationship is the great proof of immortality.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Christ and Sadducees.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The true glory of heaven is in fuller possession of God: no doubt other things, but these subsidiary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Reward is God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The idea of recompense ample and full for all sorrow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> More than adequate wages for all work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That final reward will show how wise the wanderer was, who left his father’s house and ‘looked for a city.’ God is not ashamed to be called their God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Christ comes to us-offers Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Think of how rich with Him, and oh, think of how poor without Him!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Which will you have on earth?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Which will you have in another world?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/15-1.htm" title="After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.">Genesis 15:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">After these things — </span>1st, After that act of generous charity which Abram had done, in rescuing his neighbours, God made him this gracious visit. 2d, After that victory which he had obtained over four kings: lest Abram should be too much elevated with that, God comes to tell him he had better things in store for him. <span class="ital">The word of the Lord came unto Abram — </span>That is, God manifested himself to Abram; <span class="ital">in a vision — </span>Which supposes that Abram was awake, and had some sensible token of the presence of the divine glory saying, <span class="ital">Fear not, Abram — </span>Abram might fear lest the four kings he had routed should rally and fall upon him.

"The word of the Lord," manifesting himself by speech to his servant. "In the vision" the intelligent observer passes from the merely sensible to the supersensible sphere of reality. "Fear not, Abram." The patriarch had some reason to fear. The formidable allies had indeed been defeated, and the fruits of their marauding enterprise wrested from them. But they might resume their purpose, and return with an overwhelming force. And Abram was still a stranger in a foreign land, preoccupied by tribes of another race, who would combine against him as soon as they suspected him of being an intruder. But the Lord had stood by him and given him the victory, and now speaks to him in the language of encouragement. "I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward." The word I is separately expressed, and, therefore, emphatic in the original.<p>I, Jehovah (Yahweh), the Self-existent One, the Author of existence, the Performer of promise, the Manifester of myself to man, and not any creature however exalted. This was something beyond a seed, or a land, or any temporal thing. The Creator infinitely transcends the creature. The mind of Abram is here lifted up to the spiritual and the eternal. (1) thy shield. (2) thy exceeding great reward. Abram has two fears - the presence of evil, and the absence of good. Experience and conscience had begun to teach him that both of these were justly his doom. But Yahweh has chosen him, and here engages himself to stand between him and all harm, and himself to be to him all good. With such a shield from all evil, and such a source of all good, he need not be afraid. The Lord, we see, begins, as usual, with the immediate and the tangible; but he propounds a principle that reaches to the eternal and the spiritual. We have here the opening germ of the great doctrine of "the Lord our righteousness," redeeming us on the one hand from the sentence of death, and on the other to a title to eternal life.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>Ge 15:1-21.

This is a technical expression in the O.T. for a Divine revelation to a prophet. It occurs nowhere else in the Pentateuch. It suggests the prophetic character of Abram, and should be compared with <a href="/genesis/20-7.htm" title="Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live: and if you restore her not, know you that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours.">Genesis 20:7</a> (E), where Abram is spoken of as a prophet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in a vision</span>] Evidently, as is shewn by <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/15-5.htm" title="And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.">Genesis 15:5</a></span>, the vision occurs in a dream, or in the condition described in <a href="/context/numbers/24-3.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:...">Numbers 24:3-4</a>; cf. <a href="/job/4-13.htm" title="In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,">Job 4:13</a>, “in thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Fear not</span>] The situation requiring this particular encouragement is not described.

That this was a personal designation of the pre-incarnate Logos, if not susceptible of complete demonstration, yet receives not a little sanction from the language employed throughout this narrative (cf. Vers. 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, &c.). At least the expression denotes "the Lord manifesting himself by speech to his servant" (Murphy; <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 1:3) - <span class="cmt_word">came</span> (literally, was) <span class="cmt_word">unto Abram in a vision</span> - a night vision, but no dream (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 5). Biblically viewed, the vision, as distinguished from the ordinary dream, defines the presentation to the bodily senses or to the mental consciousness of  objects usually beyond the sphere of their  natural activities; hence visions might be  imparted in dreams (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>), or in  trances (<a href="/numbers/24-4.htm">Numbers 24:4, 16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Fear not, Abram.</span> With allusion, doubtless, to the patriarch's mental dejection, which was probably occasioned by the natural re action consequent upon his late high-pitched  excitement (cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>), which  might lead him to anticipate either a war of  revenge from the Asiatic monarchs (Jonathan), or an assault from the heathen Canaanites, already jealous of his growing power,  or perhaps both. Wordsworth observes that the words here addressed to Abram are commonly employed in Scripture to introduce  announcements of Christ (<a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13, 30</a>; <a href="/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a>; cf. St. John's vision,  <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am thy shield, and thy exceed lag great reward.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">thy reward, exceeding abundantly</span>, the hiphil inf. abs.  <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> being always used adverbially (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-33.htm">Nehemiah 3:33</a>), The other rendering, "thy reward m exceeding great" (LXX., Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, Ewald), fails to give prominence to the thought that the patriarch's reward was to be the all-sufficient Jehovah himself. It is not needful to suppose with Lange an actual vision of a shield and treasure. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Abram returned with the booty which he had taken from the enemy, the king of Sodom (of course, the successor to the one who fell in the battle) and Melchizedek, king of Salem, came to meet him to congratulate him on his victory; the former probably also with the intention of asking for the prisoners who had been rescued. They met him in "the valley of Shaveh, which is (what was afterwards called) the King's dale." This valley, in which Absalom erected a monument for himself (<a href="/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>), was, according to Josephus, two stadia from Jerusalem, probably by the brook Kidron therefore, although Absalom's pillar, which tradition places there, was of the Grecian style rather than the early Hebrew. The name King's dale was given to it undoubtedly with reference to the event referred to here, which points to the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. For the Salem of Melchizedek cannot have been the Salem near to which John baptized (<a href="/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a>), or Aenon, which was eight Roman miles south of Scythopolis, as a march of about forty hours for the purpose of meeting Abraham, if not romantic, would, at least be at variance with the text of Scripture, where the kings are said to have gone out to Abram after his return. It must be Jerusalem, therefore, which is called by the old name Salem in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>, out of which the name Jerusalem (founding of peace, or possession of peace) was formed by the addition of the prefix &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;  equals  &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497; "founding," or &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; "possession." Melchizedek brings bread and wine from Salem "to supply the exhausted warriors with food and drink, but more especially as a mark of gratitude to Abram, who had conquered for them peace, freedom, and prosperity" (Delitzsch). This gratitude he expresses, as a priest of the supreme God, in the words, "Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, the founder of heaven and earth; and blessed be God, the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand." The form of the blessing is poetical, two parallel members with words peculiar to poetry, &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; for &#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498;, and &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503;. - &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500; without the article is a proper name for the supreme God, the God over all (cf. <a href="/exodus/18-11.htm">Exodus 18:11</a>), who is pointed out as the only true God by the additional clause, "founder of the heaven and the earth." On the construction of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; with &#1500;, vid., <a href="/genesis/31-15.htm">Genesis 31:15</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>, and Ges. 143, 2. &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, founder and possessor: &#1511;&#1504;&#1492; combines the meanings of &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; and &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. This priestly reception Abram reciprocated by giving him the tenth of all, i.e., of the whole of the booty taken from the enemy. Giving the tenth was a practical acknowledgment of the divine priesthood of Melchizedek; for the tenth was, according to the general custom, the offering presented to the Deity. Abram also acknowledged the God of Melchizedek as the true God; for when the king of Sodom asked for his people only, and would have left the rest of the booty to Abram, he lifted up his hand as a solemn oath "to Jehovah, the Most High God, the founder of heaven and earth," - acknowledging himself as the servant of this God by calling Him by the name Jehovah, - and swore that he would not take "from a thread to a shoe-string," i.e., the smallest or most worthless thing belonging to the king of Sodom, that he might not be able to say, he had made Abram rich. &#1488;&#1501;, as the sign of an oath, is negative, and in an earnest address is repeated before the verb. "Except (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1491;&#1497;, lit., not to me, nothing for me) only what the young men (Abram's men) have eaten, and the portion of my allies...let them take their portion:" i.e., his followers should receive what had been consumed as their share, and the allies should have the remainder of the booty.<p>Of the property belonging to the king of Sodom, which he had taken from the enemy, Abram would not keep the smallest part, because he would not have anything in common with Sodom. On the other hand, he accepted from Salem's priest and king, Melchizedek, not only bread and wine for the invigoration of the exhausted warriors, but a priestly blessing also, and gave him in return the tenth of all his booty, as a sign that he acknowledged this king as a priest of the living God, and submitted to his royal priesthood. In this self-subordination of Abram to Melchizedek there was the practical prediction of a royal priesthood which is higher than the priesthood entrusted to Abram's descendants, the sons of Levi, and foreshadowed in the noble form of Melchizedek, who blessed as king and priest the patriarch whom God had called to be a blessing to all the families of the earth. The name of this royal priest is full of meaning: Melchizedek, i.e., King of Righteousness. Even though, judging from <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-1.htm">Joshua 10:1</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>, where a much later king is called Adonizedek, i.e., Lord of Righteousness, this name may have been a standing title of the ancient kings of Salem, it no doubt originated with a king who ruled his people in righteousness, and was perfectly appropriate in the case of the Melchizedek mentioned here. There is no less significance in the name of the seat of his government, Salem, the peaceful or peace, since it shows that the capital of its kings was a citadel of peace, not only as a natural stronghold, but through the righteousness of its sovereign; for which reason David chose it as the seat of royalty in Israel; and Moriah, which formed part of it, was pointed out to Abraham by Jehovah as the place of sacrifice for the kingdom of God which was afterwards to be established. And, lastly, there was something very significant in the appearance in the midst of the degenerate tribes of Canaan of this king of righteousness, and priest of the true God of heaven and earth, without any account of his descent, or of the beginning and end of his life; so that he stands forth in the Scriptures, "without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life." Although it by no means follows from this, however, that Melchizedek was a celestial being (the Logos, or an angel), or one of the primeval patriarchs (Enoch or Shem), as Church fathers, Rabbins, and others have conjectured, and we can see in him nothing more than one, perhaps the last, of the witnesses and confessors of the early revelation of God, coming out into the light of history from the dark night of heathenism; yet this appearance does point to a priesthood of universal significance, and to a higher order of things, which existed at the commencement of the world, and is one day to be restored again. In all these respects, the noble form of this king of Salem and priest of the Most High God was a type of the God-King and eternal High Priest Jesus Christ; a thought which is expanded in <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a> on the basis of this account, and of the divine utterance revealed to David in the Spirit, that the King of Zion sitting at the right hand of Jehovah should be a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>). </body></html>
