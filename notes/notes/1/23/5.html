Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham purchases a burying-ground in the land. "The sons of Heth." These are the lords of the soil. "A stranger and a sojourner." He is a stranger, not a Hittite; a sojourner, a dweller in the land, not a mere visitor or traveller. The former explains why he has no burial-ground; the latter, why he asks to purchase one. "Bury my dead out of my sight." The bodies of those most dear to us decay, and must be removed from our sight. Abraham makes his request in the most general terms. In the somewhat exaggerated style of Eastern courtesy, the sons of Heth reply, "Hear us, my lord." One speaks for all; hence, the change of number. "My lord" is simply equivalent to our "Sir," or the German "mein Herr." "A prince of God" in those times of simple faith was a chief notably favored of God, as Abraham had been in his call, his deliverance in Egypt, his victory over the kings, his intercession for the cities of the vale, and his protection the court of Abimelek. Some of these events were well known to the Hittites, as they had occurred while he was residing among them.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 23:3-20.

Abraham, saying unto him, Hear us, my lord. My lord</span> (Adoni)   =   sir, <span class="accented">monsieur</span>, or <span class="accented">mein herr</span>. One acts as the spokesman of all; the number changing from plural to singular. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, after the Samaritan Codex, render <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>, Not so, my lord; but hear us. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art a mighty prince among us</span>. Literally, a <span class="accented">prince of Elohim</span>; not of Jehovah, since the speakers were heathen whose ideas of Deity did not transcend those expressed in the term Elohim. According to a familiar Hebrew idiom, the phrase might be legitimately translated as in the A.V. - cf. "mountains of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> great mountains, <a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; "cedars of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> goodly cedars, <a href="/psalms/80-10.htm">Psalm 80:10</a> (Calvin, Kimchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, 'Speaker's Commentary'); but, as employed by the Hittite chieftains, it probably expressed that they regarded him as a prince or phylarch, not to whom God had given an elevated aspect (Lange), but either whom God had appointed (Gesenius), or whom God manifestly favored (Kalisch, Murphy). This estimate of Abraham strikingly contrasts with that which the patriarch had formed (Ver. 4) of himself. <span class="cmt_word">In the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead; none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</span> This remarkable offer on the part of the Hittites Thomson ('Land and Book,' p. 578) regards as having been merely compliment, which Abraham was too experienced an Oriental not to understand. But, even if dictated by true kindness and generosity, the proposal was one to which for many reasons - faith in God, love for the dead, and respect for himself being among the strongest - the patriarch could not accede. With perfect courtesy, therefore, though likewise with respectful firmness, he declines their offer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Descendants of Nahor. - With the sacrifice of Isaac the test of Abraham's faith was now complete, and the purpose of his divine calling answered: the history of his life, therefore, now hastens to its termination. But first of all there is introduced quite appropriately an account of the family of his brother Nahor, which is so far in place immediately after the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, that it prepares the way for the history of the marriage of the heir of the promise. The connection is pointed out in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>, as compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>, in the expression, "she also." Nahor, like Ishmael and Jacob, had twelve sons, eight by his wife Milcah and four by his concubine; whereas Jacob had his by two wives and two maids, and Ishmael apparently all by one wife. This difference with regard to the mothers proves that the agreement as to the number twelve rests upon a good historical tradition, and is no product of a later myth, which traced to Nahor the same number of tribes as to Ishmael and Jacob. For it is a perfectly groundless assertion or assumption, that Nahor's twelve sons were the fathers of as many tribes. There are only a few names, of which it is probable that their bearers were the founders of tribes of the same name. On Uz, see <a href="/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. Buz is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a> along with Dedan and Tema as an Arabian tribe; and Elihu was a Buzite of the family of Ram (<a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>). Kemuel, the father of Aram, was not the founder of the Aramaeans, but the forefather of the family of Ram, to which the Buzite Elihu belonged, - Aram being written for Ram, like Arammim in <a href="/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a> for Rammim in <a href="/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>. Chesed again was not the father of the Chasdim (Chaldeans), for they were older than Chesed; at the most he was only the founder of one branch of the Chasdim, possibly those who stole Job's camels (Knobel; vid., <a href="/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>). Of the remaining names, Bethuel was not the founder of a tribe, but the father of Laban and Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>). The others are never met with again, with the exception of Maachach, from whom probably the Maachites (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>) in the land of Maacah, a small Arabian kingdom in the time of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>), derived their origin and name; though Maachah frequently occurs as the name of a person (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-43.htm">1 Chronicles 11:43</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16</a>). </body></html>
