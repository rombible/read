Blessed be God that there is a world where sin, death, vanity, and vexation cannot enter. Blessed be his name, that even death cannot part believers from union with Christ. Those whom we most love, yea, even our own bodies, which we so care for, must soon become loathsome lumps of clays, and be buried out of sight. How loose then should we be to all earthly attachments and adornments! Let us seek rather that our souls be adorned with heavenly graces. Abraham rendered honour and respect to the princes of Heth, although of the ungodly Canaanites. The religion of the Bible enjoins to pay due respect to all in authority, without flattering their persons, or countenancing their crimes if they are unworthy characters. And the noble generosity of these Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, selfishness, and ill-humour of many that call themselves Israelites. It was not in pride that Abraham refused the gift, because he scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but in justice and in prudence. Abraham was able to pay for the field, and therefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity. Honesty, as well as honour, forbids us to take advantage of our neighbour's liberality, and to impose, upon those who give freely.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sarah is the only woman whose age is recorded in Scripture.

But the meaning is, that he came from his own tent to Sarah's, see <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-67.htm">Genesis 24:67</a>, where her corpse was, to indulge his passion of grief and sorrow for her; which, in a moderate way, was lawful, and what natural affection and conjugal relation obliged him to. The Hebrews (w) observe, that, in the word for "weep", one of the letters is lesser than usual, and which they think denotes, that his weeping for her was not excessive, but little; but both phrases put together seem to denote that his sorrow was very great; and the one perhaps may refer to his private, and the other to his public mourning for her, according to the custom of those times. <p>(u) Pirke Eliezer, c. 32.

Beyond sitting on the ground and weeping in presence of (or upon the face of) the dead, no other rites are mentioned as having been observed by Abraham; though afterwards, as practiced among the Hebrews, Egyptians, and other nations of antiquity, mourning for the dead developed into an elaborate ritual, including such ceremonies as rending the garments, shaving the head, wearing sackcloth, covering the head with dust and ashes (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31, 35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>; <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>; <a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15, 16</a>).

But first of all there is introduced quite appropriately an account of the family of his brother Nahor, which is so far in place immediately after the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, that it prepares the way for the history of the marriage of the heir of the promise. The connection is pointed out in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/22-20.htm">Genesis 22:20</a>, as compared with <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a>, in the expression, "she also." Nahor, like Ishmael and Jacob, had twelve sons, eight by his wife Milcah and four by his concubine; whereas Jacob had his by two wives and two maids, and Ishmael apparently all by one wife. This difference with regard to the mothers proves that the agreement as to the number twelve rests upon a good historical tradition, and is no product of a later myth, which traced to Nahor the same number of tribes as to Ishmael and Jacob. For it is a perfectly groundless assertion or assumption, that Nahor's twelve sons were the fathers of as many tribes. There are only a few names, of which it is probable that their bearers were the founders of tribes of the same name. On Uz, see <a href="/genesis/10-23.htm">Genesis 10:23</a>. Buz is mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a> along with Dedan and Tema as an Arabian tribe; and Elihu was a Buzite of the family of Ram (<a href="/job/32-2.htm">Job 32:2</a>). Kemuel, the father of Aram, was not the founder of the Aramaeans, but the forefather of the family of Ram, to which the Buzite Elihu belonged, - Aram being written for Ram, like Arammim in <a href="/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a> for Rammim in <a href="/2_chronicles/22-5.htm">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>. Chesed again was not the father of the Chasdim (Chaldeans), for they were older than Chesed; at the most he was only the founder of one branch of the Chasdim, possibly those who stole Job's camels (Knobel; vid., <a href="/job/1-17.htm">Job 1:17</a>). Of the remaining names, Bethuel was not the founder of a tribe, but the father of Laban and Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>). The others are never met with again, with the exception of Maachach, from whom probably the Maachites (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>) in the land of Maacah, a small Arabian kingdom in the time of David (<a href="//biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>), derived their origin and name; though Maachah frequently occurs as the name of a person (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-43.htm">1 Chronicles 11:43</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-16.htm">1 Chronicles 27:16</a>). </body></html>
