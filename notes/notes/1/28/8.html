But he only made bad worse, and though he did not marry a "wife of the daughters of Canaan," he married into a family which God had rejected. It showed a partial reformation, but no repentance, for he gave no proofs of abating his vindictive purposes against his brother, nor cherishing that pious spirit that would have gratified his father&#8212;he was like Micah (see Jud 17:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father.
