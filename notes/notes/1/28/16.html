Rebekah had gone to one of these to inquire of Jehovah (<a href="/genesis/25-22.htm" title="And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus?

But first Abraham, and then Isaac, had for so long made Beer-sheba their home, that Jacob probably knew little about the sanctity of the spot, and felt himself far away from all the religious associations of his youth, and from that “presence of Jehovah” which in antediluvian times had also been supposed to be confined to certain localities (<a href="/genesis/4-16.htm" title="And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelled in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.">Genesis 4:16</a>).

Wherever we are, in the city or in the desert, in the house or in the field, in the shop or in the street, we may keep up our intercourse with Heaven, if it is not our own fault.

He knew his omnipresence; but he did not expect a special manifestation of the Lord in this place, far from the sanctuaries of his father. He is filled with solemn awe, when he finds himself in the house of God and at the gate of heaven. The pillar is the monument of the event. The pouring of oil upon it is an act of consecration to God who has there appeared to him <a href="/numbers/7-1.htm">Numbers 7:1</a>. He calls the name of the place Bethel, "the house of God." This is not the first time it received the name. Abraham also worshipped God here, and met with the name already existing (see on <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>.)<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Which had been sweet unto him, and out of his dream, it being now over; and it having left such a weight upon his mind, and such an awe upon his spirits, it might tend the sooner to awaken him; what time it was is not said, perhaps it was in the middle of the night or towards morning, since after this it is said that he rose early in the morning: <p>and he said, surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not; God is everywhere, in a general way, upholding all things by his power, as he is immense and omnipresent; but here he was in a special sense, by some signal token of his presence; by a stream of light and glory darting from the heavens, hence Onkelos and Jonathan paraphrase it,"the glory of the Lord, and the glory of the majesty of the Lord;''and by the appearance of angels, and by the communications of his mind and will, and grace to Jacob, and that communion he had with him in his dream, of which he was very sensible: for, when he says, "I knew it not", the meaning is, he did not think or expect to meet with God in such a place; he did not know that God ever appeared anywhere but in the houses of his people, such as his father's house; and in the congregation of the faithful, or where the saints met for public worship, or where an altar was erected for God: though sometimes God is present with his people, and they are not sensible of it; as the church in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>; and as Mary, when Christ was at her elbow, and she knew him not, <a href="/john/20-13.htm">John 20:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">in this place</span>] Jacob’s words express astonishment that Jehovah should have manifested Himself (<span class="ital">a</span>) in a place remote from his father’s home; (<span class="ital">b</span>) to himself a solitary wanderer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">this place</span>] Compare <a href="/exodus/3-5.htm" title="And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.">Exodus 3:5</a>, “the place whereon thou standest is holy ground”; <a href="/joshua/5-15.htm" title="And the captain of the LORD's host said to Joshua, Loose your shoe from off your foot; for the place where on you stand is holy.

Jacob does not here learn the doctrine of the Divine omnipresence for the first time (Knobel), but now discovers that the covenant God of Abraham revealed himself at other than consecrated places (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Murphy); or perhaps simply gives expression to his astonishment at finding that whereas he fancied himself alone, he was in reality in the company of God <span class="accented">- so plus adeptum ease quam sperare ausus fuisset</span> (Calvin). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jacob's Dream at Bethel. - As he was travelling from Beersheba, where Isaac was then staying (<a href="/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>), to Haran, Jacob came to a place where he was obliged to stop all night, because the sun had set. The words "he hit (lighted) upon the place," indicate the apparently accidental, yet really divinely appointed choice of this place for his night-quarters; and the definite article points it out as having become well known through the revelation of God that ensued. After making a pillow with the stones (&#1502;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, head-place, pillow), he fell asleep and had a dream, in which he saw a ladder resting upon the earth, with the top reaching to heaven; and upon it angels of God going up and down, and Jehovah Himself standing above it. The ladder was a visible symbol of the real and uninterrupted fellowship between God in heaven and His people upon earth. The angels upon it carry up the wants of men to God, and bring down the assistance and protection of God to men. The ladder stood there upon the earth, just where Jacob was lying in solitude, poor, helpless, and forsaken by men. Above in heaven stood Jehovah, and explained in words the symbol which he saw. Proclaiming Himself to Jacob as the God of his fathers, He not only confirmed to him all the promises of the fathers in their fullest extent, but promised him protection on his journey and a safe return to his home (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). But as the fulfilment of this promise to Jacob was still far off, God added the firm assurance, "I will not leave thee till I have done (carried out) what I have told thee." </body></html>
