When, then, he sees Jacob sent away to obtain a wife, in accordance with the rule established by Abraham, he determines also to conform to it, and marries a daughter of Ishmael. She is called Bashe-math in chap 36:3, and described in both places as “the sister of Nebajoth,” in order to show that as Nebajoth “the firstborn” (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm" title="And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,">Genesis 25:13</a>) was undoubtedly the son of Ishmael by his first wife, “whom Hagar took for him out of the land of Egypt” (<a href="/genesis/21-21.htm" title="And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.">Genesis 21:21</a>), so also Mahalath shared in this precedence, and was not the daughter of any of Ishmael’s subsequent wives, or of a concubine.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/28-6.htm" title="When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from there; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;">Genesis 28:6</a></span>. This passage comes in, in the midst of Jacob’s story, to show the influence of good example.

But he only made bad worse, and though he did not marry a "wife of the daughters of Canaan," he married into a family which God had rejected.
