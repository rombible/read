This corrected him for the fraud on his father. The blessing shall be conferred on him, yet he shall smart for the indirect course taken to obtain it. Jacob is dismissed by his father with a solemn charge. He must not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan: those who profess religion, should not marry with those that care not for religion. Also with a solemn blessing. Isaac had before blessed him unwittingly; now he does it designedly. This blessing is more full than the former; it is a gospel blessing. This promise looks as high as heaven, of which Canaan was a type. That was the better country which Jacob and the other patriarchs had in view.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Isaac has now become alive to the real destiny of Jacob. He therefore calls for him to bless him, and give him a command. The command is to take a wife, not from Kenaan, but from the kindred of his parents. The blessing comes from "God Almighty" (<a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>). It is that belonging to the chosen seed, "the blessing of Abraham." It embraces a numerous offspring, the land of promise, and all else that is included in the blessing of Abraham. "A congregation of peoples." This is the word "congregation" (&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;  qa&#770;ha&#772;l) which is afterward applied to the assembled people of God, and to which the Greek &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  ekkle&#772;sia, "ecclesia," corresponds. Jacob complies with his mother's advice and his father's command, and, at the same time, reaps the bitter fruit of his fraud against his brother in the hardship and treachery of an exile of twenty years. The aged Isaac is not without his share in the unpleasant consequences of endeavoring to go against the will of God.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 28<p>Ge 28:1-19.
