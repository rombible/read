Granting with St. Ambrose that it was the substitution of a smaller for a greater sin, and with St. Chrysostom that Lot was bound by the laws of hospitality to do his utmost to protect his guests, yet he was also bound as a father equally to protect his daughters to the last extremity: and if men might substitute smaller for greater sins, they would have an excuse for practising every form of wickedness. The difficulty arises from the high character given of Lot by St. Peter (<a href="/context/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2Peter 2:7-8</a>): but Lot was righteous only relatively; and though his soul was daily vexed by what he saw, it was not vexed enough to make him quit such evil surroundings, and return to the healthy and virtuous life of the mountains. And, when finally he sought refuge in them, as it was not of his own free will, but on compulsion (<a href="/genesis/19-30.htm" title="And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelled in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelled in a cave, he and his two daughters.">Genesis 19:30</a>), he found there no peace, but shared, even if unknowingly, in deeds of horrible lust. The warning of his fall is, that men who part with religious privileges for the sake of worldly advantage are in danger of sinking into moral degradation, and of losing, with their faith and hope, not only their self-respect and happiness, but even that earthly profit for the sake of which they sacrificed their religion.<p><span class= "bld">Unto these men.</span>—The form of the pronoun is archaic, and occurs again in <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm" title="And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.">Genesis 19:25</a>.

All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wicked violence of the citizens displays itself. They compass the house, and demand the men for the vilest ends. How familiar Lot had become with vice, when any necessity whatever could induce him to offer his daughters to the lust of these Sodomites! We may suppose it was spoken rashly, in the heat of the moment, and with the expectation that he would not be taken at his word. So it turned out. "Stand back." This seems to be a menace to frighten Lot out of the way of their perverse will. It is probable, indeed, that he and his family would not have been so long safe in this wicked place, had he not been the occasion of a great deliverance to the whole city when they were carried away by the four kings. The threat is followed by a taunt, when the sorely vexed host hesitated to give up the strangers. "He will needs be a judge." It is evident Lot had been in the habit of remonstrating with them. From threats and taunts they soon proceed to violence. His guests now interfere. They rescue Lot, and smite the rioters with blindness, or a wandering of the senses, so that they cannot find the door. This ebullition of the vilest passion seals the doom of the city.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. men of Sodom, compassed the house&#8212;Appalling proofs are here given of their wickedness.

Lot’s proposal, so atrocious in our ears, may have been deemed meritorious in an Eastern country, where no sacrifice was considered too great to maintain inviolate the safety of a stranger who had been received in hospitality. That Lot should have thought of imperilling the honour of his family, and not have rather hazarded his own life, is due not so much to the weakness of the man as to the terribly low estimate of womanhood which prevailed at that time. A parallel is afforded by the story in <a href="/judges/1-19.htm" title="And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.">Jdg 1:19</a>. The three regulations of modern Arab law as to the protection of the stranger are recorded by Robertson Smith in his <span class="ital">Kinship</span>, p. 259, “(1) the man whose tent rope has touched thine is thy stranger; (2) so also is he who journeys with thee by day and sleeps by thy side at night; (3) the guest who eats with thee is under thy protection, until he has eaten with another.”<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The messengers (angels) sent by Jehovah to Sodom, arrived there in the evening, when Lot, who was sitting at the gate, pressed them to pass the night in his house. The gate, generally an arched entrance with deep recesses and seats on either side, was a place of meeting in the ancient towns of the East, where the inhabitants assembled either for social intercourse or to transact public business (vid., <a href="/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>, etc.). The two travellers, however (for such Lot supposed them to be, and only recognised them as angels when they had smitten the Sodomites miraculously with blindness), said that they would spend the night in the street - &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489; the broad open space within the gate - as they had been sent to inquire into the state of the town. But they yielded to Lot's entreaty to enter his house; for the deliverance of Lot, after having ascertained his state of mind, formed part of their commission, and entering into his house might only serve to manifest the sin of Sodom in all its heinousness. While Lot was entertaining his guests with the greatest hospitality, the people of Sodom gathered round his house, "both old and young, all people from every quarter" (of the town, as in <a href="/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a>), and demanded, with the basest violation of the sacred rite of hospitality and the most shameless proclamation of their sin (<a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>), that the strangers should be brought out, that they might know them. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is applied, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22</a>, to the carnal sin of paederastia, a crime very prevalent among the Canaanites (<a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a>., <a href="/leviticus/20-23.htm">Leviticus 20:23</a>), and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>, a curse of heathenism generally. </body></html>
