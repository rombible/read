All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages.

The Eternal is here designated by the name Elohim, the Everlasting, because in the war of elements in which the cities were overwhelmed, the eternal potencies of his nature were signally displayed.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. Abraham gat up early in the morning, &c.&#8212;Abraham was at this time in Mamre, near Hebron, and a traveller last year verified the truth of this passage. "From the height which overlooks Hebron, where the patriarch stood, the observer at the present day has an extensive view spread out before him towards the Dead Sea. A cloud of smoke rising from the plain would be visible to a person at Hebron now, and could have been, therefore, to Abraham as he looked toward Sodom on the morning of its destruction by God" [Hackett]. It must have been an awful sight, and is frequently alluded to in Scripture (De 29:23; Isa 13:19; Jude 7). "The plain which is now covered by the Salt or Dead Sea shows in the great difference of level between the bottoms of the northern and southern ends of the lake&#8212;the latter being thirteen feet and the former thirteen hundred&#8212;that the southern end was of recent formation, and submerged at the time of the fall of the cities" [Lynch].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain,....

It is not the usual word for smoke, but rather corresponds to our “reek” or, as Driver, “steam.” Travellers relate that, owing to rapid evaporation, there always appears a steamy mist rising up from the Dead Sea. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/10-6.htm" title="When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man, who fled from the fire which fell down upon the five cities....">Wis 10:6-7</a>, “While the ungodly were perishing, wisdom delivered a righteous man, when he fled from the fire that descended out of heaven on Pentapolis.

It may be added that this opinion has received the sanction of Robinson, Stanley, Porter, Thomson (The Land and the Book), and other eminent geographers. On the other hand, there are reasons for believing that the true site of the cities was at the north, and not the south, of the Dead Sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The circle of the Jordan was visible from the Bethel plateau (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>); the southern extremity of the Dead Sea is not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> From the heights above Hebron or Mature, though the actual circle is not visible, "yet the depression between the nearer hills and those of Gilead can be perceived, and Abraham could at once identify the locality whence the smoke arose," after Sodom's burning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Chedorlaomer's route (<a href="/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7-14</a>) was from Kadesh to Hazezon-tamar, midway up the western shore of the Dead Sea, from Hazezon-tamar to the vale of Siddim, and from Siddim to Dan, the natural conclusion being that on reaching Hazezon-tamar he did not turn southward, but continued marching northwards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> Moses from Mount Nebo (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>) beheld"' the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar," which was certainly possible if Zoar was in the line of vision with the plain and the city of Jericho, but as certainly impossible if it was at the southern extremity of the lake This view has been advocated by Grove (Smith's 'Biblical Dictionary,' art. ZONE) and by Tristram ('Land of Israel,' pp. 354-358, and 'Land of Moab,' pp. 330-334), and has been adopted by Drew ('Imp.' 'Bible Dict.,' art.

Cf.

Ego, sicut inelitas quondam urbes igne celesti flagrasse concesserim." For traditional notices of this event by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Pliny, Ovid, &c. <span class="accented">vide</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller (Scholia I. <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they left him here (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;, to let loose, and leave, to leave to one's self), the Lord commanded him, for the sake of his life, not to look behind him, and not to stand still in all the plain (&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>), but to flee to the mountains (afterwards called the mountains of Moab). In <a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a> we are struck by the change from the plural to the singular: "when they brought them forth, he said." To think of one of the two angels - the one, for example, who led the conversation - seems out of place, not only because Lot addressed him by the name of God, "Adonai" (<a href="/genesis/19-18.htm">Genesis 19:18</a>), but also because the speaker attributed to himself the judgment upon the cities (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>, <a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>), which is described in <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a> as executed by Jehovah. Yet there is nothing to indicate that Jehovah suddenly joined the angels. The only supposition that remains, therefore, is that Lot recognised in the two angels a manifestation of God, and so addressed them (<a href="/genesis/19-18.htm">Genesis 19:18</a>) as Adonai (my Lord), and that the angel who spoke addressed him as the messenger of Jehovah in the name of God, without its following from this, that Jehovah was present in the two angels. Lot, instead of cheerfully obeying the commandment of the Lord, appealed to the great mercy shown to him in the preservation of his life, and to the impossibility of his escaping to the mountains, without the evil overtaking him, and entreated therefore that he might be allowed to take refuge in the small and neighbouring city, i.e., in Bela, which received the name of Zoar (<a href="/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>) on account of Lot's calling it little. Zoar, the &#x3a3;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1; of the lxx, and Segor of the crusaders, is hardly to be sought for on the peninsula which projects a long way into the southern half of the Dead Sea, in the Ghor of el Mezraa, as Irby and Robinson (Pal. iii. p. 481) suppose; it is much more probably to be found on the south-eastern point of the Dead Sea, in the Ghor of el Szaphia, at the opening of the Wady el Ahsa (vid., v. Raumer, Pal. p. 273, Anm. 14). </body></html>
