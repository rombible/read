All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The visitors now take steps for the deliverance of Lot and his kindred before the destruction of the cities. All that are related to him are included in the offer of deliverance. There is a blessing in being connected with the righteous, if men will but avail themselves of it. Lot seems bewildered by the contemptuous refusal of his connections to leave the place. His early choice and his growing habits have attached him to the place, notwithstanding its temptations. His married daughters, or at least the intended husbands of the two who were at home ("who are here"), are to be left behind. But though these thoughts make him linger, the mercy of the Lord prevails. The angels use a little violence to hasten their escape. The mountain was preserved by its elevation from the flood of rain, sulphur, and fire which descended on the low ground on which the cities were built. Lot begs for a small town to which he may retreat, as he shrinks from the perils of a mountain dwelling, and his request is mercifully granted.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. Hast thou here any besides? &#8230; we will destroy this place&#8212;Apostolic authority has declared Lot was "a righteous man" (2Pe 2:8), at bottom good, though he contented himself with lamenting the sins that he saw, instead of acting on his own convictions, and withdrawing himself and family from such a sink of corruption. But favor was shown him: and even his bad relatives had, for his sake, an offer of deliverance, which was ridiculed and spurned (2Pe 3:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For we will destroy this place,....

"Only to these men (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, an archaism for &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; rof, occurs also in <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-27.htm">Leviticus 18:27</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-11.htm">Deuteronomy 19:11</a>; and &#1488;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-8.htm">1 Chronicles 20:8</a>) do nothing, for therefore (viz., to be protected from injury) have they come under the shadow of my roof." In his anxiety, Lot was willing to sacrifice to the sanctity of hospitality his duty as a father, which ought to have been still more sacred, "and committed the sin of seeking to avert sin by sin." Even if he expected that his daughters would suffer no harm, as they were betrothed to Sodomites (<a href="/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a>), the offer was a grievous violation of his paternal duty. But this offer only heightened the brutality of the mob. "Stand back" (make way, <a href="/isaiah/49-20.htm">Isaiah 49:20</a>), they said; "the man, who came as a foreigner, is always wanting to play the judge" (probably because Lot had frequently reproved them for their licentious conduct, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2-8.htm">2 Peter 2:8</a>): "not will we deal worse with thee than with them." With these words they pressed upon him, and approached the door to break it in. The men inside, that is to say, the angels, then pulled Lot into the house, shut the door, and by miraculous power smote the people without with blindness (&#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; here and <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a> for mental blindness, in which the eye sees, but does not see the right object), as a punishment for their utter moral blindness, and an omen of the coming judgment. </body></html>
