All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wicked violence of the citizens displays itself. They compass the house, and demand the men for the vilest ends. How familiar Lot had become with vice, when any necessity whatever could induce him to offer his daughters to the lust of these Sodomites! We may suppose it was spoken rashly, in the heat of the moment, and with the expectation that he would not be taken at his word. So it turned out. "Stand back." This seems to be a menace to frighten Lot out of the way of their perverse will. It is probable, indeed, that he and his family would not have been so long safe in this wicked place, had he not been the occasion of a great deliverance to the whole city when they were carried away by the four kings. The threat is followed by a taunt, when the sorely vexed host hesitated to give up the strangers. "He will needs be a judge." It is evident Lot had been in the habit of remonstrating with them. From threats and taunts they soon proceed to violence. His guests now interfere. They rescue Lot, and smite the rioters with blindness, or a wandering of the senses, so that they cannot find the door. This ebullition of the vilest passion seals the doom of the city.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. men of Sodom, compassed the house&#8212;Appalling proofs are here given of their wickedness.

They came to the door, and opened it, and put out their hands, one on one side the door, and the other on the other: <p>and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door; and thus they rescued Lot from the fury and rage of the men of Sodom, and prevented his daughters being exposed unto them, as he had offered. This action showed them to be more than men, that they should open the door, take in Lot, and shut it so suddenly, that the men of Sodom could take no advantage of it, could neither retain Lot, nor enter the door when opened, and especially what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the men</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the angels) <span class="cmt_word">put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door</span> <span class="accented">- deleth</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 6). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The messengers (angels) sent by Jehovah to Sodom, arrived there in the evening, when Lot, who was sitting at the gate, pressed them to pass the night in his house. The gate, generally an arched entrance with deep recesses and seats on either side, was a place of meeting in the ancient towns of the East, where the inhabitants assembled either for social intercourse or to transact public business (vid., <a href="/genesis/34-20.htm">Genesis 34:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>, etc.). The two travellers, however (for such Lot supposed them to be, and only recognised them as angels when they had smitten the Sodomites miraculously with blindness), said that they would spend the night in the street - &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489; the broad open space within the gate - as they had been sent to inquire into the state of the town. But they yielded to Lot's entreaty to enter his house; for the deliverance of Lot, after having ascertained his state of mind, formed part of their commission, and entering into his house might only serve to manifest the sin of Sodom in all its heinousness. While Lot was entertaining his guests with the greatest hospitality, the people of Sodom gathered round his house, "both old and young, all people from every quarter" (of the town, as in <a href="/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a>), and demanded, with the basest violation of the sacred rite of hospitality and the most shameless proclamation of their sin (<a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>), that the strangers should be brought out, that they might know them. &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; is applied, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22</a>, to the carnal sin of paederastia, a crime very prevalent among the Canaanites (<a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a>., <a href="/leviticus/20-23.htm">Leviticus 20:23</a>), and according to <a href="//biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>, a curse of heathenism generally. </body></html>
