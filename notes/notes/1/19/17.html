All the people of Sodom were very wicked and vile. Care was therefore taken for saving Lot and his family. Lot lingered; he trifled. Thus many who are under convictions about their spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, defer that needful work. The salvation of the most righteous men is of God's mercy, not by their own merit. We are saved by grace. God's power also must be acknowledged in bringing souls out of a sinful state If God had not been merciful to us, our lingering had been our ruin. Lot must flee for his life. He must not hanker after Sodom. Such commands as these are given to those who, through grace, are delivered out of a sinful state and condition. Return not to sin and Satan. Rest not in self and the world. Reach toward Christ and heaven, for that is escaping to the mountain, short of which we must not stop. Concerning this destruction, observe that it is a revelation of the wrath of God against sin and sinners of all ages. Let us learn from hence the evil of sin, and its hurtful nature; it leads to ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The visitors now take steps for the deliverance of Lot and his kindred before the destruction of the cities. All that are related to him are included in the offer of deliverance. There is a blessing in being connected with the righteous, if men will but avail themselves of it. Lot seems bewildered by the contemptuous refusal of his connections to leave the place. His early choice and his growing habits have attached him to the place, notwithstanding its temptations. His married daughters, or at least the intended husbands of the two who were at home ("who are here"), are to be left behind. But though these thoughts make him linger, the mercy of the Lord prevails. The angels use a little violence to hasten their escape. The mountain was preserved by its elevation from the flood of rain, sulphur, and fire which descended on the low ground on which the cities were built. Lot begs for a small town to which he may retreat, as he shrinks from the perils of a mountain dwelling, and his request is mercifully granted.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-17. The kindly interest the angels took in the preservation of Lot is beautifully displayed. But he "lingered." Was it from sorrow at the prospect of losing all his property, the acquisition of many years? Or was it that his benevolent heart was paralyzed by thoughts of the awful crisis? This is the charitable way of accounting for a delay that would have been fatal but for the friendly urgency of the angel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either one of the angels said this, or the third person, the Lord himself, who having parted from Abraham, after some time came to Lot, as appears both by the change of the number; for before this he speaks of them in the plural number, but from hence in the singular number, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/19-19.htm" title="Behold now, your servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your mercy, which you have showed to me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:">Genesis 19:19</a>,21,22</span>; and by the variation of the phrase, for the other two speak with submission, and as servants, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/19-13.htm" title="For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.">Genesis 19:13</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord hath sent us, </span>& c.; but this speaks with more authority, as is evident from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/19-21.htm" title="And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.">Genesis 19:21</a>,22</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Escape for thy life, </span> i.e. as thou lovest thy life.

Into the fields of Sodom, or the suburbs of it: <p>that he said, escape for thy life; not one of the two men or angels that had been with him all the night past, for they had now left him, and were gone back to the city: but Jehovah the Son of God, who had been communing with Abraham, and now came to Sodom, and appeared to Lot, just at the time the two angels left him, and bid him escape with all haste, if he had any regard for his life, and that of those with him: <p>look not behind thee; as showing any concern for his goods and substance he had left behind him, or for his sons-in-law, who refused to come with him, and much less for the wicked inhabitants of the city; and this command was not given to Lot only, but to his wife and daughters, as appears by the sequel: <p>neither stay thou in all the plain: in the plain of Jordan, for the whole plain, and the cities in it, were to be destroyed: <p>escape to the mountain, lest thou be destroyed, lest thou be consumed; the same mountain the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, and they that were with them after the battle of the kings, fled to, <a href="/genesis/14-10.htm">Genesis 14:10</a>; here only he and his could be safe from the conflagration of the plain. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</span><p>(i) He willed him to flee God's judgments and not to be sorry to leave that rich country, full of vain pleasures.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">he said</span>] One of the men is spokesman, as in <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/19-21.htm" title="And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.">Genesis 19:21</a></span>; but the plural “they said” is found in the LXX and Lat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">look not behind thee</span>] The meaning of this direction, which recalls the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, is not quite obvious. It may be a prohibition either of irresolute lingering, or of regretful curiosity. It is, probably, also, a test of obedience, combined with the thought that man could not look upon Jehovah and live. Cf. <a href="/genesis/16-13.htm" title="And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, You God see me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that sees me?">Genesis 16:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Plain</span>] i.e. the <span class="ital">kikkar</span>: see <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm" title="And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.">Genesis 13:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the mountain</span>] i.e. the mountainous region on the east of the Dead Sea, “the mountains of Moab.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when they had brought them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Lot and his family) <span class="cmt_word">forth abroad</span> (literally, <span class="accented">without</span>; sc. the city), <span class="cmt_word">that he</span> - one of the angels (Rabbi Solomon, Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lange, 'Speaker's Commentary'); <span class="cmt_word">the one that had taken Lot's hand</span> (Inglis); Jehovah speaking through the angel (Delitzsch); the angel speaking in the name of God (Keil, Kalisch); Jehovah himself, who, though not mentioned, had now appeared upon the scene (Ainsworth, Candlish) - <span class="cmt_word">said, Escape for thy life</span> (literally, <span class="accented">for thy soul</span>; and clearly in this case the loss of the soul in the higher sense must have been involved in the destruction of the life); <span class="cmt_word">look not behind thee</span>. From the event it may be inferred that this injunction was also given to Lot's wife and daughters; perhaps to hide God's working in the fiery judgment from mortal vision (Knobel), but more likely to express detestation of the abhorred city (Bush), to guard against the incipience of any desire to return (Lange), and to stimulate their zeal to escape destruction. Neither stay thou in all the plain - or "circle" (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>).

"Only to these men (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;, an archaism for &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; rof, occurs also in <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/18-27.htm">Leviticus 18:27</a>, and <a href="/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-11.htm">Deuteronomy 19:11</a>; and &#1488;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-8.htm">1 Chronicles 20:8</a>) do nothing, for therefore (viz., to be protected from injury) have they come under the shadow of my roof." In his anxiety, Lot was willing to sacrifice to the sanctity of hospitality his duty as a father, which ought to have been still more sacred, "and committed the sin of seeking to avert sin by sin." Even if he expected that his daughters would suffer no harm, as they were betrothed to Sodomites (<a href="/genesis/19-14.htm">Genesis 19:14</a>), the offer was a grievous violation of his paternal duty. But this offer only heightened the brutality of the mob. "Stand back" (make way, <a href="/isaiah/49-20.htm">Isaiah 49:20</a>), they said; "the man, who came as a foreigner, is always wanting to play the judge" (probably because Lot had frequently reproved them for their licentious conduct, <a href="//biblehub.com/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2-8.htm">2 Peter 2:8</a>): "not will we deal worse with thee than with them." With these words they pressed upon him, and approached the door to break it in. The men inside, that is to say, the angels, then pulled Lot into the house, shut the door, and by miraculous power smote the people without with blindness (&#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; here and <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a> for mental blindness, in which the eye sees, but does not see the right object), as a punishment for their utter moral blindness, and an omen of the coming judgment. </body></html>
