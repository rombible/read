This blessing seems to indicate that, whereas in the case of some plants many individuals of the same species were simultaneously created, so as to produce a universal covering of verdure for the land and an abundant supply of aliment for the animals about to be created - in regard to these animals a single pair only, at all events of the larger kinds, was at first called into being, from which, by the potent blessing of the Creator, was propagated the multitude by which the waters and the air were peopled. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 1:20-23.

It is connected with the gift of life (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a></span>). The animal world differs from the vegetable world in its distinctive principle of life. The animals possess powers, instincts, and energies which are to be exercised, and on the exercise of which God gives His blessing. He has placed them in conditions favourable to their development and multiplication. Modern science, especially as represented by the honoured names of Darwin and Lyell, has shewn in what wonderful and varied ways the blessing of God has attended both the multiplication of animal life and the adaptation of the animals to their surroundings.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God blessed them</span>. To bless is to wish well to (<a href="/genesis/27-4.htm">Genesis 27:4</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-23.htm">Numbers 6:23</a>). In the case of God blessing inanimate things, it signifies to make them to prosper and be abundant (<a href="/exodus/23-25.htm">Exodus 23:25</a>; <a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-11.htm">Psalm 65:11</a>). The nature of the blessing pronounced upon the animal creation had reference to their propagation and increase. <span class="cmt_word">Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</span> The paronomastic combination, be <span class="accented">fruitful and multiply</span>, became a regular formula of blessing (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-60.htm">Genesis 24:60</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/48-4.htm">Genesis 48:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3, 4</a>). The Divine benediction was not simply a wish; but, adds Calvin, "by the bare intimation of his purpose he effects what men seek by entreaty." Nor was it meaningless that the words of benediction were addressed to the creatures; it was designed to teach that the "force of the Divine word was not meant to be transient, but, being infused into their natures, to take root and constantly bear fruit" (Calvin). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Fifth Day. - "God said: Let the waters swarm with swarms, with living beings, and let birds fly above the earth in the face (the front, i.e., the side turned towards the earth) of the firmament." &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1508;&#1507; are imperative. Earlier translators, on the contrary, have rendered the latter as a relative clause, after the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; of the lxx, "and with birds that fly;" thus making the birds to spring out of the water, in opposition to <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>. Even with regard to the element out of which the water animals were created the text is silent; for the assertion that &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; is to be understood "with a causative colouring" is erroneous, and is not sustained by <a href="/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a> or <a href="/psalms/105-30.htm">Psalm 105:30</a>. The construction with the accusative is common to all verbs of multitude. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, to creep and swarm, is applied, "without regard to size, to those animals which congregate together in great numbers, and move about among one another." &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1490;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, anima viva, living soul, animated beings (vid., <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is in apposition to &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, "swarms consisting of living beings." The expression applies not only to fishes, but to all water animals from the greatest to the least, including reptiles, etc. In carrying out His word, God created (<a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>) the great "tanninim," - lit., the long-stretched, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;, to stretch-whales, crocodiles, and other sea-monsters; and "all moving living beings with which the waters swarm after their kind, and all (every) winged fowl after its kind." That the water animals and birds of every kind were created on the same day, and before the land animals, cannot be explained on the ground assigned by early writers, that there is a similarity between the air and the water, and a consequent correspondence between the two classes of animals. For in the light of natural history the birds are at all events quite as near to the mammalia as to the fishes; and the supposed resemblance between the fins of fishes and the wings of birds, is counterbalanced by the no less striking resemblance between birds and land animals, viz., that both have feet. The real reason is rather this, that the creation proceeds throughout from the lower to the higher; and in this ascending scale the fishes occupy to a great extent a lower place in the animal economy than birds, and both water animals and birds a lower place than land animals, more especially the mammalia. Again, it is not stated that only a single pair was created of each kind; on the contrary, the words, "let the waters swarm with living beings," seem rather to indicate that the animals were created, not only in a rich variety of genera and species, but in large numbers of individuals. The fact that but one human being was created at first, by no means warrants the conclusion that the animals were created singly also; for the unity of the human race has a very different signification from that of the so-called animal species. - (<a href="/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>). As animated beings, the water animals and fowls are endowed, through the divine blessing, with the power to be fruitful and multiply. The word of blessing was the actual communication of the capacity to propagate and increase in numbers. </body></html>
