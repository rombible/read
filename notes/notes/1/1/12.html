Though the use of them is allowed to man, they are from God, and to his service and honour they must be used. The earth, at his command, brings forth grass, herbs, and fruits. God must have the glory of all the benefit we receive from the produce of the earth. If we have, through grace, an interest in Him who is the Fountain, we may rejoice in him when the streams of temporal mercies are dried up.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Here the fulfillment of the divine command is detailed, after being summed up in the words "it was so," at the close of the previous verse. This seems to arise from the nature of growth, which has a commencement, indeed, but goes on without ceasing in a progressive development. It appears from the text that the full plants, and not the seeds, germs, or roots, were created. The land sent forth grass, herb, tree, each in its fully developed form. This was absolutely necessary, if man and the land animals were to be sustained by grasses, seeds, and fruits.<p>Thus, the land begins to assume the form of beauty and fertility. Its bare and rough soil is set with the germs of an incipient verdure. It has already ceased to be "a waste." And now, at the end of this third day, let us pause to review the natural order in which everything has been thus far done. It was necessary to produce light in the first place, because without this potent element water could not pass into vapor, and rise on the wings of the buoyant air into the region above the expanse. The atmosphere must in the next place be reduced to order, and charged with its treasures of vapor, before the plants could commence the process of growth, even though stimulated by the influence of light and heat. Again, the waters must be withdrawn from a portion of the solid surface before the plants could be placed in the ground, so as to have the full benefit of the light, air, and vapor in enabling them to draw from the soil the sap by which they are to be nourished. When all these conditions are fulfilled, then the plants themselves are called into existence, and the first cycle of the new creation is completed.<p>Could not the Eternal One have accomplished all this in one day? Doubtless, He might. He might have effected it all in an instant of time. And He might have compressed the growth and development of centuries into a moment. He might even by possibility have constructed the stratifications of the earth's crust with all their slips, elevations, depressions, unconformities, and organic formations in a day. And, lastly, He might have carried on to completion all the evolutions of universal nature that have since taken place or will hereafter take place until the last hour has struck on the clock of time. But what then? What purpose would have been served by all this speed? It is obvious that the above and such like questions are not wisely put. The very nature of the eternal shows the futility of such speculations. Is the commodity of time so scarce with him that he must or should for any good reason sum up the course of a universe of things in an infinitesimal portion of its duration? May we not, rather, must we not, soberly conclude that there is a due proportion between the action and the time of the action, the creation to be developed and the time of development. Both the beginning and the process of this latest creation are to a nicety adjusted to the preexistent and concurrent state of things. And the development of what is created not only displays a mutual harmony and exact coincidence in the progress of all its other parts, but is at the same time finely adapted to the constitution of man, and the natural, safe, and healthy ratio of his physical and metaphysical movements. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. let the earth bring forth&#8212;The bare soil was clothed with verdure, and it is noticeable that the trees, plants, and grasses&#8212;the three great divisions of the vegetable kingdom here mentioned&#8212;were not called into existence in the same way as the light and the air; they were made to grow, and they grew as they do still out of the ground&#8212;not, however, by the slow process of vegetation, but through the divine power, without rain, dew, or any process of labor&#8212;sprouting up and flourishing in a single day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This clause is so often added, to show that all the disorders, evil and hurtful qualities, that now are in the creatures, are not to be imputed to God, who made all of them good; but to manâ€™s sin, which hath corrupted their nature, and perverted their use. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the earth brought forth grass,....

In all probability the seed forms were in the soil from the first, only waiting to be vitalized by the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim - The</span> Spirit of God; or they may have been then created. Certainly they were not evolved from the dead matter of the dry land. Scripture, no more than science, is acquainted with Abiogenesis. Believing that "if it were given to her to- look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time, she might "witness the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter," science yet honestly affirms "that she sees no reason for believing that the feat (of vitalizing dead matter) has been performed yet" (Huxley's 'Brit. Association Address, 1871); and Scripture is emphatic that, if it is protoplasm which makes organized beings, the power which manufactures protoplasm is the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim</span>, acting in obedience to the <span class="accented">Divine Logos</span>. The time when the earth put forth its verdure, viz., towards the close of the third day, after light, air, earth, and water had been prepared and so adjusted as to minister to the life of plants, was a signal proof of the wisdom of the Creator and of the naturalness of his working. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Third Day. - The work of this day was twofold, yet closely connected. At first the waters beneath the heavens, i.e., those upon the surface of the earth, were gathered together, so that the dry (&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, the solid ground) appeared. In what way the gathering of the earthly waters in the sea and the appearance of the dry land were effected, whether by the sinking or deepening of places in the body of the globe, into which the water was drawn off, or by the elevation of the solid ground, the record does not inform us, since it never describes the process by which effects are produced. It is probable, however, that the separation was caused both by depression and elevation. With the dry land the mountains naturally arose as the headlands of the mainland. But of this we have no physical explanations, either in the account before us, or in the poetical description of the creation in <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm">Psalm 54:1-7</a>. Even if we render <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/54-8.htm">Psalm 54:8</a>, "the mountains arise, and they (the waters) descend into the valleys, to the place which Thou (Jehovah) hast founded for them," we have no proof, in this poetical account, of the elevation-theory of geology, since the psalmist is not speaking as a naturalist, but as a sacred poet describing the creation on the basis of <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. "The dry" God called Earth, and "the gathering of the waters," i.e., the place into which the waters were collected, He called Sea. &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, an intensive rather than a numerical plural, is the great ocean, which surrounds the mainland on all sides, so that the earth appears to be founded upon seas (<a href="/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>). Earth and sea are the two constituents of the globe, by the separation of which its formation was completed. The "seas" include the rivers which flow into the ocean, and the lakes which are as it were "detached fragments" of the ocean, though they are not specially mentioned here. By the divine act of naming the two constituents of the globe, and the divine approval which follows, this work is stamped with permanency; and the second act of the third day, the clothing of the earth with vegetation, is immediately connected with it. At the command of God "the earth brought forth green (&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;), seed yielding herb (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;( breh ), and fruit-bearing fruit-trees (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1506;&#1509;)." These three classes embrace all the productions of the vegetable kingdom. &#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, lit., the young, tender green, which shoots up after rain and covers the meadows and downs (<a href="/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>; <a href="/job/38-27.htm">Job 38:27</a>; <a href="/joel/2-22.htm">Joel 2:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>), is a generic name for all grasses and cryptogamous plants. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;, with the epithet &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;, yielding or forming seed, is used as a generic term for all herbaceous plants, corn, vegetables, and other plants by which seed-pods are formed. &#1508;&#1512;&#1497; &#1506;&#1509;: not only fruit-trees, but all trees and shrubs, bearing fruit in which there is a seed according to its kind, i.e., fruit with kernels. &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1506;&#1500; (upon the earth) is not to be joined to "fruit-tree," as though indicating the superior size of the trees which bear seed above the earth, in distinction from vegetables which propagate their species upon or in the ground; for even the latter bear their seed above the earth. It is appended to &#1514;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, as a more minute explanation: the earth is to bring forth grass, herb, and trees, upon or above the ground, as an ornament or covering for it. &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493; (after its kind), from &#1502;&#1497;&#1503; species, which is not only repeated in <a href="/genesis/1-12.htm">Genesis 1:12</a> in its old form &#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1490;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; in the case of the fruit-tree, but is also appended to the herb. It indicates that the herbs and trees sprang out of the earth according to their kinds, and received, together with power to bear seed and fruit, the capacity to propagate and multiply their own kind. In the case of the grass there is no reference either to different kinds, or to the production of seed, inasmuch as in the young green grass neither the one nor the other is apparent to the eye. Moreover, we must not picture the work of creation as consisting of the production of the first tender germs which were gradually developed into herbs, shrubs, and trees; on the contrary, we must regard it as one element in the miracle of creation itself, that at the word of God not only tender grasses, but herbs, shrubs, and trees, sprang out of the earth, each ripe for the formation of blossom and the bearing of seed and fruit, without the necessity of waiting for years before the vegetation created was ready to blossom and bear fruit. Even if the earth was employed as a medium in the creation of the plants, since it was God who caused it to bring them forth, they were not the product of the powers of nature, generatio aequivoca in the ordinary sense of the word, but a work of divine omnipotence, by which the trees came into existence before their seed, and their fruit was produced in full development, without expanding gradually under the influence of sunshine and rain. </body></html>
