God forbid that by indulging the body, and the desires of it, we should make ourselves like the beasts that perish! Man was to be a creature different from all that had been hitherto made. Flesh and spirit, heaven and earth, must be put together in him. God said, Let us make man. Man, when he was made, was to glorify the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Into that great name we are baptized, for to that great name we owe our being. It is the soul of man that especially bears God's image. Man was made upright, Ec 7:29. His understanding saw Divine things clearly and truly; there were no errors or mistakes in his knowledge; his will consented at once, and in all things, to the will of God. His affections were all regular, and he had no bad appetites or passions. His thoughts were easily brought and fixed to the best subjects. Thus holy, thus happy, were our first parents in having the image of God upon them. But how is this image of God upon man defaced!

We discern here two stages in his creation. The general fact is stated in the first clause of the verse, and then the two particulars. "In the image of God created he him." This is the primary act, in which his relation to his Maker is made prominent. In this his original state he is actually one, as God in whose image he is made is one. "Male and female created he them." This is the second act or step in his formation. He is now no longer one, but two, - the male and the female. His adaptation to be the head of a race is hereby completed. This second stage in the existence of man is more circumstantially described hereafter <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21-25</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. The last stage in the progress of creation being now reached&#8212;God said, Let us make man&#8212;words which show the peculiar importance of the work to be done, the formation of a creature, who was to be God's representative, clothed with authority and rule as visible head and monarch of the world. In our image, after our likeness&#8212;This was a peculiar distinction, the value attached to which appears in the words being twice mentioned. And in what did this image of God consist? Not in the erect form or features of man, not in his intellect, for the devil and his angels are, in this respect, far superior; not in his immortality, for he has not, like God, a past as well as a future eternity of being; but in the moral dispositions of his soul, commonly called original righteousness (Ec 7:29). As the new creation is only a restoration of this image, the history of the one throws light on the other; and we are informed that it is renewed after the image of God in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness (Col 3:10; Eph 4:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not both together, as some of the Jews have fabled, but successively, the woman after and out of the man, as is more particularly related, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/2-21.htm" title="And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;">Genesis 2:21</a></span>, &c., which is here mentioned by anticipation.

The Jerusalem Targum is, <p>the Word of the Lord created man in his likeness; even that Word that was in the beginning with God, and was God, and in time became incarnate, by whom all things were made, <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. <p>in the image of God created he him; which is repeated for the certainty of it, and that it might be taken notice of, as showing man's superior glory and dignity to the rest of the creatures, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>. <p>male and female created he them; not that man was created an hermaphrodite, or with two bodies, back to back united together, and afterwards cleaved asunder, as the Jews fabulously say; but first God made man, or the male, out of the dust of the earth, and infused a rational soul into him; and then out of one of his ribs made a female, or woman, who was presented to him as his wife, that so their species might be propagated; and only one male and one female were created, to show that hereafter a man was to have at a time no more wives than one; see <a href="/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15</a> for all that is said in the following chapter, concerning the formation of man out of the dust of the earth, and the making of woman out of his rib, and presenting her to him, and his taking her to be his wife, were all done on this sixth day, and at this time. It is a tradition among the Heathens, that man was made last of all the creatures; so says Plato (k); and this notion the Chinese also have (l). The Jews give these reasons why man was made on the evening of the sabbath, to show that he did not assist in the work of creation; and that if he was elated in his mind, it might be told him that a fly was created before him, and that he might immediately enter on the command, i.e. of the sabbath (m). <p>(k) Protagor. p. 320, 321.

They are to be solved not by Revelation in Holy Scripture, but by the exercise of the gifts of patient enquiry, accurate observation, and sound reasoning. The Hebrew writer has in view a population drawn from a single stock. His account of the origin of Man, applicable to one race, is symbolical of all, if a plurality of origin is to be assumed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> (or and) <span class="cmt_word">God created</span> (<span class="accented">bars</span>, as in vers. 1, 21, q.v.) <span class="cmt_word">man</span> (literally; the Adam referred to in ver. 26) <span class="cmt_word">in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them</span>.

Murphy notices two stages in man's creation, the general fact being stated in the first clause of this triumphal song, and the two particulars - first his relation to his Maker, and second his sexual distinction - in its other members. In the third clause Luther sees an intimation "that the woman also was created by God, and made a partaker of the Divine image, and of dominion over all." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Sixth Day. - Sea and air are filled with living creatures; and the word of God now goes forth to the earth, to produce living beings after their kind. These are divided into three classes. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, cattle, from &#1489;&#1492;&#1501;, mutum, brutum esse, generally denotes the larger domesticated quadrupeds (e.g., <a href="/genesis/47-18.htm">Genesis 47:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>, etc.), but occasionally the larger land animals as a whole. &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474; (the creeping) embraces the smaller land animals, which move either without feet, or with feet that are scarcely perceptible, viz., reptiles, insects, and worms. In <a href="/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a> they are distinguished from the race of water reptiles by the term &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; (the old form of the construct state, for &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;), the beast of the earth, i.e., the freely roving wild animals.<p>"After its kind:" this refers to all three classes of living creatures, each of which had its peculiar species; consequently in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a>, where the word of God is fulfilled, it is repeated with every class. This act of creation, too, like all that precede it, is shown by the divine word "good" to be in accordance with the will of God. But the blessing pronounced is omitted, the author hastening to the account of the creation of man, in which the work of creation culminated. The creation of man does not take place through a word addressed by God to the earth, but as the result of the divine decree, "We will make man in Our image, after our likeness," which proclaims at the very outset the distinction and pre-eminence of man above all the other creatures of the earth. The plural "We" was regarded by the fathers and earlier theologians almost unanimously as indicative of the Trinity: modern commentators, on the contrary, regard it either as pluralis majestatis; or as an address by God to Himself, the subject and object being identical; or as communicative, an address to the spirits or angels who stand around the Deity and constitute His council. The last is Philo's explanation: &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#834;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  equals  angels). But although such passages as <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a>, show that God, as King and Judge of the world, is surrounded by heavenly hosts, who stand around His throne and execute His commands, the last interpretation founders upon this rock: either it assumes without sufficient scriptural authority, and in fact in opposition to such distinct passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, <a href="/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a> seq., <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/44-24.htm">Genesis 44:24</a>, that the spirits took part in the creation of man; or it reduces the plural to an empty phrase, inasmuch as God is made to summon the angels to cooperate in the creation of man, and then, instead of employing them, is represented as carrying out the work alone. Moreover, this view is irreconcilable with the words "in our image, after our likeness;" since man was created in the image of God alone (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>), and not in the image of either the angels, or God and the angels. A likeness to the angels cannot be inferred from <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm">Hebrews 2:7</a>, or from <a href="/luke/20-36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>. Just as little ground is there for regarding the plural here and in other passages (<a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>) as reflective, an appeal to self; since the singular is employed in such cases as these, even where God Himself is preparing for any particular work (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>). No other explanation is left, therefore, than to regard it as pluralis majestatis, - an interpretation which comprehends in its deepest and most intensive form (God speaking of Himself and with Himself in the plural number, not reverentiae causa, but with reference to the fullness of the divine powers and essences which He possesses) the truth that lies at the foundation of the trinitarian view, viz., that the potencies concentrated in the absolute Divine Being are something more than powers and attributes of God; that they are hypostases, which in the further course of the revelation of God in His kingdom appeared with more and more distinctness as persons of the Divine Being. On the words "in our image, after our likeness" modern commentators have correctly observed, that there is no foundation for the distinction drawn by the Greek, and after them by many of the Latin Fathers, between &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; (imago) and &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (similitudo), the former of which they supposed to represent the physical aspect of the likeness to God, the latter the ethical; but that, on the contrary, the older Lutheran theologians were correct in stating that the two words are synonymous, and are merely combined to add intensity to the thought: "an image which is like Us" (Luther); since it is no more possible to discover a sharp or well-defined distinction in the ordinary use of the words between &#1510;&#1500;&#1501; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, than between &#1489;&#1468; and &#1499;&#1468;. &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, from &#1510;&#1500;, lit., a shadow, hence sketch, outline, differs no more from &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, likeness, portrait, copy, than the German words Umriss or Abriss (outline or sketch) from Bild or Abbild (likeness, copy). &#1489;&#1468; and &#1499;&#1468; are also equally interchangeable, as we may see from a comparison of this verse with <a href="/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a> and <a href="/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3</a>. (Compare also <a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-12.htm">Leviticus 27:12</a>, and for the use of &#1489;&#1468; to denote a norm, or sample, <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-37.htm">Exodus 30:37</a>, etc.) There is more difficulty in deciding in what the likeness to God consisted. Certainly not in the bodily form, the upright position, or commanding aspect of the man, since God has no bodily form, and the man's body was formed from the dust of the ground; nor in the dominion of man over nature, for this is unquestionably ascribed to man simply as the consequence or effluence of his likeness to God. Man is the image of God by virtue of his spiritual nature. of the breath of God by which the being, formed from the dust of the earth, became a living soul.<p>(Note: "The breath of God became the soul of man; the soul of man therefore is nothing but the breath of God. The rest of the world exists through the word of God; man through His own peculiar breath. This breath is the seal and pledge of our relation to God, of our godlike dignity; whereas the breath breathed into the animals is nothing but the common breath, the life-wind of nature, which is moving everywhere, and only appears in the animal fixed and bound into a certain independence and individuality, so that the animal soul is nothing but a nature-soul individualized into certain, though still material spirituality." - Ziegler.)<p>The image of God consists, therefore, in the spiritual personality of man, though not merely in unity of self-consciousness and self-determination, or in the fact that man was created a consciously free Ego; for personality is merely the basis and form of the divine likeness, not its real essence. This consists rather in the fact, that the man endowed with free self-conscious personality possesses, in his spiritual as well as corporeal nature, a creaturely copy of the holiness and blessedness of the divine life. This concrete essence of the divine likeness was shattered by sin; and it is only through Christ, the brightness of the glory of God and the expression of His essence (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), that our nature is transformed into the image of God again (<a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>).<p>"And they (&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, a generic term for men) shall have dominion over the fish," etc. There is something striking in the introduction of the expression "and over all the earth," after the different races of animals have been mentioned, especially as the list of races appears to be proceeded with afterwards. If this appearance were actually the fact, it would be impossible to escape the conclusion that the text is faulty, and that &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; has fallen out; so that the reading should be, "and over all the wild beasts of the earth," as the Syriac has it. But as the identity of "every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;) with "every thing that creepeth upon the ground" (&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;) in <a href="/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a> is not absolutely certain; on the contrary, the change in expression indicates a difference of meaning; and as the Masoretic text is supported by the oldest critical authorities (lxx, Sam., Onk.), the Syriac rendering must be dismissed as nothing more than a conjecture, and the Masoretic text be understood in the following manner. The author passes on from the cattle to the entire earth, and embraces all the animal creation in the expression, "every moving thing (&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;) that moveth upon the earth," just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, "every living thing &#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514; upon the earth." According to this, God determined to give to the man about to be created in His likeness the supremacy, not only over the animal world, but over the earth itself; and this agrees with the blessing in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where the newly created man is exhorted to replenish the earth and subdue it; whereas, according to the conjecture of the Syriac, the subjugation of the earth by man would be omitted from the divine decree. - <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>. In the account of the accomplishment of the divine purpose the words swell into a jubilant song, so that we meet here for the first time with a parallelismus membrorum, the creation of man being celebrated in three parallel clauses. The distinction drawn between &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; (in the image of God created He him) and &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; (as man and woman created He them) must not be overlooked. The word &#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, which indicates that God created the man and woman as two human beings, completely overthrows the idea that man was at first androgynous (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>.). By the blessing in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, God not only confers upon man the power to multiply and fill the earth, as upon the beasts in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>, but also gives him dominion over the earth and every beast. In conclusion, the food of both man and beast is pointed out in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a>, exclusively from the vegetable kingdom. Man is to eat of "every seed-bearing herb on the face of all the earth, and every tree on which there are fruits containing seed," consequently of the productions of both field and tree, in other words, of corn and fruit; the animals are to eat of "every green herb," i.e., of vegetables or green plants, and grass.<p>From this it follows, that, according to the creative will of God, men were not to slaughter animals for food, nor were animals to prey upon one another; consequently, that the fact which now prevails universally in nature and the order of the world, the violent and often painful destruction of life, is not a primary law of nature, nor a divine institution founded in the creation itself, but entered the world along with death at the fall of man, and became a necessity of nature through the curse of sin. It was not till after the flood, that men received authority from God to employ the flesh of animals as well as the green herb as food (<a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>); and the fact that, according to the biblical view, no carnivorous animals existed at the first, may be inferred from the prophetic announcements in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>, where the cessation of sin and the complete transformation of the world into the kingdom of God are described as being accompanied by the cessation of slaughter and the eating of flesh, even in the case of the animal kingdom. With this the legends of the heathen world respecting the golden age of the past, and its return at the end of time, also correspond (cf. Gesenius on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>). It is true that objections have been raised by natural historians to this testimony of Scripture, but without scientific ground. For although at the present time man is fitted by his teeth and alimentary canal for the combination of vegetable and animal food; and although the law of mutual destruction so thoroughly pervades the whole animal kingdom, that not only is the life of one sustained by the death of another, but "as the graminivorous animals check the overgrowth of the vegetable kingdom, so the excessive increase of the former is restricted by the beasts of prey, and of these again by the destructive implements of man;" and although, again, not only beasts of prey, but evident symptoms of disease are met with among the fossil remains of the aboriginal animals: all these facts furnish no proof that the human and animal races were originally constituted for death and destruction, or that disease and slaughter are older than the fall. For, to reply to the last objection first, geology has offered no conclusive evidence of its doctrine, that the fossil remains of beasts of prey and bones with marks of disease belong to a pre-Adamite period, but has merely inferred it from the hypothesis already mentioned of successive periods of creation. Again, as even in the present order of nature the excessive increase of the vegetable kingdom is restrained, not merely by the graminivorous animals, but also by the death of the plants themselves through the exhaustion of their vital powers; so the wisdom of the Creator could easily have set bounds to the excessive increase of the animal world, without requiring the help of huntsmen and beasts of prey, since many animals even now lose their lives by natural means, without being slain by men or eaten by beasts of prey. The teaching of Scripture, that death entered the world through sin, merely proves that the human race was created for eternal life, but by no means necessitates the assumption that the animals were also created for endless existence. As the earth produced them at the creative word of God, the different individuals and generations would also have passed away and returned to the bosom of the earth, without violent destruction by the claws of animals or the hand of man, as soon as they had fulfilled the purpose of their existence. The decay of animals is a law of nature established in the creation itself, and not a consequence of sin, or an effect of the death brought into the world by the sin of man. At the same time, it was so far involved in the effects of the fall, that the natural decay of the different animals was changed into a painful death or violent end. Although in the animal kingdom, as it at present exists, many varieties are so organized that they live exclusively upon the flesh of other animals, which they kill and devour; this by no means necessitates the conclusion, that the carnivorous beasts of prey were created after the fall, or the assumption that they were originally intended to feed upon flesh, and organized accordingly. If, in consequence of the curse pronounced upon the earth after the sin of man, who was appointed head and lord of nature, the whole creation was subjected to vanity and the bondage of corruption (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>.); this subjection might have been accompanied by a change in the organization of the animals, though natural science, which is based upon the observation and combination of things empirically discovered, could neither demonstrate the fact nor explain the process. And if natural science cannot boast that in any one of its many branches it has discovered all the phenomena connected with the animal and human organism of the existing world, how could it pretend to determine or limit the changes through which this organism may have passed in the course of thousands of years?<p>The creation of man and his installation as ruler on the earth brought the creation of all earthly beings to a close (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>). God saw His work, and behold it was all very good; i.e., everything perfect in its kind, so that every creature might reach the goal appointed by the Creator, and accomplish the purpose of its existence. By the application of the term "good" to everything that God made, and the repetition of the word with the emphasis "very" at the close of the whole creation, the existence of anything evil in the creation of God is absolutely denied, and the hypothesis entirely refuted, that the six days' work merely subdued and fettered an ungodly, evil principle, which had already forced its way into it. The sixth day, as being the last, is distinguished above all the rest by the article - &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; "a day, the sixth" (Gesenius, 111, 2a). </body></html>
