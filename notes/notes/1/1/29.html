We are not to suppose that they did not eat seeds and fruits, but that the fundamental supply for the maintenance of animal life was the blade and leaf, and that of human life the perfected seed and ripe fruit. Man is thus from the first pointed out as of a higher organisation than the animal; and the fact that his food is such as requires preparation and cooking has been the basis, not merely of most of the refinements of life, but even of the close union of the family.

In ancient times this was the rule. Flesh was not the staple of man’s diet, but the eating of it was a religious ceremony, at which certain portions were offered to God and burnt on His altar, and the rest consumed by man as the Deity’s guests. So we may well believe that until the flood the descendants of Seth partook of flesh rarely, and only at a sacrifice, but that after the flood a more free use of it was permitted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/context/genesis/1-29.htm" title="And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat....">Genesis 1:29-30</a>. </span><span class="ital">I have given you every herb — </span>It does not appear that liberty was given to men to eat animal food before the flood.

With our habits it may seem a matter of course that each should at once appropriate what he needs of things at his hand. But in the beginning of existence it could not be so. Of two things proceeding from the same creative hand neither has any original or inherent right to interfere in any way whatever with the other. The absolute right to each lies in the Creator alone. The one, it is true, may need the other to support its life, as fruit is needful to man. And therefore the just Creator cannot make one creature dependent for subsistence on another without granting to it the use of that other. But this is a matter between Creator and creature, not by any means between creature and creature. Hence, it was necessary to the rightful adjustment of things, whenever a rational creature was ushered into the world, that the Creator should give an express permission to that creature to partake of the fruits of the earth. And in harmony with this view we shall hereafter find an exception made to this general grant <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>. Thus, we perceive, the necessity of this formal grant of the use of certain creatures to moral and responsible man lies deep in the nature of things. And the sacred writer here hands down to us from the mists of a hoary antiquity the primitive deed of conveyance, which lies at the foundation of the the common property of man in the earth, and all that it contains.<p>The whole vegetable world is assigned to the animals for food. In the terms of the original grant the herb bearing seed and the tree bearing fruit are especially allotted to man, because the grain and the fruit were edible by man without much preparation. As usual in Scripture the chief parts are put for the whole, and accordingly this specification of the ordinary and the obvious covers the general principle that whatever part of the vegetable kingdom is convertible into food by the ingenuity of man is free for his use. It is plain that a vegetable diet alone is expressly conceded to man in this original conveyance, and it is probable that this alone was designed for him in the state in which he was created. But we must bear in mind that he was constituted master of the animal as well as of the vegetable world; and we cannot positively affirm that his dominion did not involve the use of them for food.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. Be fruitful, &c.&#8212;The human race in every country and age has been the offspring of the first pair. Amid all the varieties found among men, some black, some copper-colored, others white, the researches of modern science lead to a conclusion, fully accordant with the sacred history, that they are all of one species and of one family (Ac 17:26). What power in the word of God! "He spake and it was done. He commanded and all things stood fast" [Ps 33:9]. "Great and manifold are thy works, Lord God Almighty! in wisdom hast thou made them all" [Ps 104:24]. We admire that wisdom, not only in the regular progress of creation, but in its perfect adaptation to the end. God is represented as pausing at every stage to look at His work. No wonder He contemplated it with complacency. Every object was in its right place, every vegetable process going on in season, every animal in its structure and instincts suited to its mode of life and its use in the economy of the world. He saw everything that He had made answering the plan which His eternal wisdom had conceived; and, "Behold it was very good" [Ge 1:31].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is neither affirmed nor denied that flesh also was granted to the first men for food, and therefore we may safely be ignorant of it.

Provision of Food<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In this verse God gives food to mankind consisting of the seed-bearing herbs and the fruit of trees. By comparison with <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm" title="Every moving thing that lives shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.">Genesis 9:3</a>, we see that the writer believed that, until after the Flood, mankind subsisted upon a purely vegetable diet. It may be asked how, if this were the case, man had the opportunity of exercising his dominion over fish, birds, and beasts: if he did not wish to eat them, neither would he wish to kill them. The truth seems to be that, according to the P version of Hebrew tradition, the first generations of mankind were intended to live, without bloodshed or violence, in an ideal condition, like that predicted by Isaiah (<a href="/context/genesis/11-6.htm" title="And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do....">Genesis 11:6-9</a>), “they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain.” The prophet’s words, “a little child shall lead them,” imply a dominion over the animal world which does not rest upon force.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Provision for the sustenance of the newly-appointed monarch and his subjects is next made. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</span> Of the three classes into which the vegetable creation was divided, grass, herbs, and trees (ver. 12), the two last were assigned to man for food. Macdonald thinks that without this express conveyance man would have been warranted to partake of them for nourishment, warranted by the necessities of his nature. The same reasoning, however, would have entitled him to kill the lower animals if he judged them useful for his support. Murphy with more truth remarks, "Of two things proceeding from the same creative hand, neither has any original or inherent right to interfere in any way with the other. The absolute right to each lies in the Creator alone. The one, it is true, may need the other to support its life, as fruit is needful to man; and, therefore, the just Creator cannot make one creature dependent for subsistence on another without granting to it the use of that other. But this is a matter between Creator and creature, and not by any means between creature and creature." The primitive charter of man's common property in the earth, and all that it contains, is the present section of this ancient document. Among other reasons for the formal conveyance to man of the herbs and trees may be noted a desire to keep him mindful of his dependent condition. Though lord of the creation, he was yet to draw the means of his subsistence from the creature which he ruled. Whether man was a vegetarian prior to the fall is debated. On the one hand it is contended that the original grant does not formally exclude the animals, and, in fact, says nothing about man's relation to the animals (Macdonald); that we cannot positively affirm that man's dominion over the animals did not involve the use of them for food (Murphy); and that as men offered sacrifices from their flocks, it is probable they ate the flesh of the victims (Calvin), On the other hand it is argued that the Divine language cannot be held as importing morn than it really says, arid that <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a> distinctly teaches that man's right to the animal creation dates from the time of Noah (Kalisch, Knobel, Alford, &c.). Almost all nations have traditions of a golden age of innocence, when men abstained from killing animals (cf. Ovid, 'Met.,' 1:103-106). Scripture alone anticipates a. time when such shall again be a characteristic of earth's inhabitants (<a href="/isaiah/11-7.htm">Isaiah 11:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Sixth Day. - Sea and air are filled with living creatures; and the word of God now goes forth to the earth, to produce living beings after their kind. These are divided into three classes. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, cattle, from &#1489;&#1492;&#1501;, mutum, brutum esse, generally denotes the larger domesticated quadrupeds (e.g., <a href="/genesis/47-18.htm">Genesis 47:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>, etc.), but occasionally the larger land animals as a whole. &#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474; (the creeping) embraces the smaller land animals, which move either without feet, or with feet that are scarcely perceptible, viz., reptiles, insects, and worms. In <a href="/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a> they are distinguished from the race of water reptiles by the term &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; (the old form of the construct state, for &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;), the beast of the earth, i.e., the freely roving wild animals.<p>"After its kind:" this refers to all three classes of living creatures, each of which had its peculiar species; consequently in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a>, where the word of God is fulfilled, it is repeated with every class. This act of creation, too, like all that precede it, is shown by the divine word "good" to be in accordance with the will of God. But the blessing pronounced is omitted, the author hastening to the account of the creation of man, in which the work of creation culminated. The creation of man does not take place through a word addressed by God to the earth, but as the result of the divine decree, "We will make man in Our image, after our likeness," which proclaims at the very outset the distinction and pre-eminence of man above all the other creatures of the earth. The plural "We" was regarded by the fathers and earlier theologians almost unanimously as indicative of the Trinity: modern commentators, on the contrary, regard it either as pluralis majestatis; or as an address by God to Himself, the subject and object being identical; or as communicative, an address to the spirits or angels who stand around the Deity and constitute His council. The last is Philo's explanation: &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#834;&#x3c5; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  equals  angels). But although such passages as <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>., <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a>, show that God, as King and Judge of the world, is surrounded by heavenly hosts, who stand around His throne and execute His commands, the last interpretation founders upon this rock: either it assumes without sufficient scriptural authority, and in fact in opposition to such distinct passages as <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, <a href="/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a> seq., <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/44-24.htm">Genesis 44:24</a>, that the spirits took part in the creation of man; or it reduces the plural to an empty phrase, inasmuch as God is made to summon the angels to cooperate in the creation of man, and then, instead of employing them, is represented as carrying out the work alone. Moreover, this view is irreconcilable with the words "in our image, after our likeness;" since man was created in the image of God alone (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a>), and not in the image of either the angels, or God and the angels. A likeness to the angels cannot be inferred from <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm">Hebrews 2:7</a>, or from <a href="/luke/20-36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>. Just as little ground is there for regarding the plural here and in other passages (<a href="/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22</a>) as reflective, an appeal to self; since the singular is employed in such cases as these, even where God Himself is preparing for any particular work (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>). No other explanation is left, therefore, than to regard it as pluralis majestatis, - an interpretation which comprehends in its deepest and most intensive form (God speaking of Himself and with Himself in the plural number, not reverentiae causa, but with reference to the fullness of the divine powers and essences which He possesses) the truth that lies at the foundation of the trinitarian view, viz., that the potencies concentrated in the absolute Divine Being are something more than powers and attributes of God; that they are hypostases, which in the further course of the revelation of God in His kingdom appeared with more and more distinctness as persons of the Divine Being. On the words "in our image, after our likeness" modern commentators have correctly observed, that there is no foundation for the distinction drawn by the Greek, and after them by many of the Latin Fathers, between &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd; (imago) and &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (similitudo), the former of which they supposed to represent the physical aspect of the likeness to God, the latter the ethical; but that, on the contrary, the older Lutheran theologians were correct in stating that the two words are synonymous, and are merely combined to add intensity to the thought: "an image which is like Us" (Luther); since it is no more possible to discover a sharp or well-defined distinction in the ordinary use of the words between &#1510;&#1500;&#1501; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, than between &#1489;&#1468; and &#1499;&#1468;. &#1510;&#1500;&#1501;, from &#1510;&#1500;, lit., a shadow, hence sketch, outline, differs no more from &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, likeness, portrait, copy, than the German words Umriss or Abriss (outline or sketch) from Bild or Abbild (likeness, copy). &#1489;&#1468; and &#1499;&#1468; are also equally interchangeable, as we may see from a comparison of this verse with <a href="/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1</a> and <a href="/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3</a>. (Compare also <a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4</a> with <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/27-12.htm">Leviticus 27:12</a>, and for the use of &#1489;&#1468; to denote a norm, or sample, <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-32.htm">Exodus 30:32</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/exodus/30-37.htm">Exodus 30:37</a>, etc.) There is more difficulty in deciding in what the likeness to God consisted. Certainly not in the bodily form, the upright position, or commanding aspect of the man, since God has no bodily form, and the man's body was formed from the dust of the ground; nor in the dominion of man over nature, for this is unquestionably ascribed to man simply as the consequence or effluence of his likeness to God. Man is the image of God by virtue of his spiritual nature. of the breath of God by which the being, formed from the dust of the earth, became a living soul.<p>(Note: "The breath of God became the soul of man; the soul of man therefore is nothing but the breath of God. The rest of the world exists through the word of God; man through His own peculiar breath. This breath is the seal and pledge of our relation to God, of our godlike dignity; whereas the breath breathed into the animals is nothing but the common breath, the life-wind of nature, which is moving everywhere, and only appears in the animal fixed and bound into a certain independence and individuality, so that the animal soul is nothing but a nature-soul individualized into certain, though still material spirituality." - Ziegler.)<p>The image of God consists, therefore, in the spiritual personality of man, though not merely in unity of self-consciousness and self-determination, or in the fact that man was created a consciously free Ego; for personality is merely the basis and form of the divine likeness, not its real essence. This consists rather in the fact, that the man endowed with free self-conscious personality possesses, in his spiritual as well as corporeal nature, a creaturely copy of the holiness and blessedness of the divine life. This concrete essence of the divine likeness was shattered by sin; and it is only through Christ, the brightness of the glory of God and the expression of His essence (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), that our nature is transformed into the image of God again (<a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>).<p>"And they (&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, a generic term for men) shall have dominion over the fish," etc. There is something striking in the introduction of the expression "and over all the earth," after the different races of animals have been mentioned, especially as the list of races appears to be proceeded with afterwards. If this appearance were actually the fact, it would be impossible to escape the conclusion that the text is faulty, and that &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514; has fallen out; so that the reading should be, "and over all the wild beasts of the earth," as the Syriac has it. But as the identity of "every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" (&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;) with "every thing that creepeth upon the ground" (&#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492;) in <a href="/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25</a> is not absolutely certain; on the contrary, the change in expression indicates a difference of meaning; and as the Masoretic text is supported by the oldest critical authorities (lxx, Sam., Onk.), the Syriac rendering must be dismissed as nothing more than a conjecture, and the Masoretic text be understood in the following manner. The author passes on from the cattle to the entire earth, and embraces all the animal creation in the expression, "every moving thing (&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;) that moveth upon the earth," just as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, "every living thing &#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514; upon the earth." According to this, God determined to give to the man about to be created in His likeness the supremacy, not only over the animal world, but over the earth itself; and this agrees with the blessing in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where the newly created man is exhorted to replenish the earth and subdue it; whereas, according to the conjecture of the Syriac, the subjugation of the earth by man would be omitted from the divine decree. - <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>. In the account of the accomplishment of the divine purpose the words swell into a jubilant song, so that we meet here for the first time with a parallelismus membrorum, the creation of man being celebrated in three parallel clauses. The distinction drawn between &#1488;&#1514;&#1493; (in the image of God created He him) and &#1488;&#1514;&#1501; (as man and woman created He them) must not be overlooked. The word &#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, which indicates that God created the man and woman as two human beings, completely overthrows the idea that man was at first androgynous (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>.). By the blessing in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, God not only confers upon man the power to multiply and fill the earth, as upon the beasts in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>, but also gives him dominion over the earth and every beast. In conclusion, the food of both man and beast is pointed out in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a>, exclusively from the vegetable kingdom. Man is to eat of "every seed-bearing herb on the face of all the earth, and every tree on which there are fruits containing seed," consequently of the productions of both field and tree, in other words, of corn and fruit; the animals are to eat of "every green herb," i.e., of vegetables or green plants, and grass.<p>From this it follows, that, according to the creative will of God, men were not to slaughter animals for food, nor were animals to prey upon one another; consequently, that the fact which now prevails universally in nature and the order of the world, the violent and often painful destruction of life, is not a primary law of nature, nor a divine institution founded in the creation itself, but entered the world along with death at the fall of man, and became a necessity of nature through the curse of sin. It was not till after the flood, that men received authority from God to employ the flesh of animals as well as the green herb as food (<a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>); and the fact that, according to the biblical view, no carnivorous animals existed at the first, may be inferred from the prophetic announcements in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>, where the cessation of sin and the complete transformation of the world into the kingdom of God are described as being accompanied by the cessation of slaughter and the eating of flesh, even in the case of the animal kingdom. With this the legends of the heathen world respecting the golden age of the past, and its return at the end of time, also correspond (cf. Gesenius on <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-8</a>). It is true that objections have been raised by natural historians to this testimony of Scripture, but without scientific ground. For although at the present time man is fitted by his teeth and alimentary canal for the combination of vegetable and animal food; and although the law of mutual destruction so thoroughly pervades the whole animal kingdom, that not only is the life of one sustained by the death of another, but "as the graminivorous animals check the overgrowth of the vegetable kingdom, so the excessive increase of the former is restricted by the beasts of prey, and of these again by the destructive implements of man;" and although, again, not only beasts of prey, but evident symptoms of disease are met with among the fossil remains of the aboriginal animals: all these facts furnish no proof that the human and animal races were originally constituted for death and destruction, or that disease and slaughter are older than the fall. For, to reply to the last objection first, geology has offered no conclusive evidence of its doctrine, that the fossil remains of beasts of prey and bones with marks of disease belong to a pre-Adamite period, but has merely inferred it from the hypothesis already mentioned of successive periods of creation. Again, as even in the present order of nature the excessive increase of the vegetable kingdom is restrained, not merely by the graminivorous animals, but also by the death of the plants themselves through the exhaustion of their vital powers; so the wisdom of the Creator could easily have set bounds to the excessive increase of the animal world, without requiring the help of huntsmen and beasts of prey, since many animals even now lose their lives by natural means, without being slain by men or eaten by beasts of prey. The teaching of Scripture, that death entered the world through sin, merely proves that the human race was created for eternal life, but by no means necessitates the assumption that the animals were also created for endless existence. As the earth produced them at the creative word of God, the different individuals and generations would also have passed away and returned to the bosom of the earth, without violent destruction by the claws of animals or the hand of man, as soon as they had fulfilled the purpose of their existence. The decay of animals is a law of nature established in the creation itself, and not a consequence of sin, or an effect of the death brought into the world by the sin of man. At the same time, it was so far involved in the effects of the fall, that the natural decay of the different animals was changed into a painful death or violent end. Although in the animal kingdom, as it at present exists, many varieties are so organized that they live exclusively upon the flesh of other animals, which they kill and devour; this by no means necessitates the conclusion, that the carnivorous beasts of prey were created after the fall, or the assumption that they were originally intended to feed upon flesh, and organized accordingly. If, in consequence of the curse pronounced upon the earth after the sin of man, who was appointed head and lord of nature, the whole creation was subjected to vanity and the bondage of corruption (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>.); this subjection might have been accompanied by a change in the organization of the animals, though natural science, which is based upon the observation and combination of things empirically discovered, could neither demonstrate the fact nor explain the process. And if natural science cannot boast that in any one of its many branches it has discovered all the phenomena connected with the animal and human organism of the existing world, how could it pretend to determine or limit the changes through which this organism may have passed in the course of thousands of years?<p>The creation of man and his installation as ruler on the earth brought the creation of all earthly beings to a close (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>). God saw His work, and behold it was all very good; i.e., everything perfect in its kind, so that every creature might reach the goal appointed by the Creator, and accomplish the purpose of its existence. By the application of the term "good" to everything that God made, and the repetition of the word with the emphasis "very" at the close of the whole creation, the existence of anything evil in the creation of God is absolutely denied, and the hypothesis entirely refuted, that the six days' work merely subdued and fettered an ungodly, evil principle, which had already forced its way into it. The sixth day, as being the last, is distinguished above all the rest by the article - &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; "a day, the sixth" (Gesenius, 111, 2a). </body></html>
