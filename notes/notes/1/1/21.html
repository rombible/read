In the selection of different words to express the divine operation, two considerations seem to have guided the author's pen - variety and propriety of diction. The diversity of words appears to indicate a diversity in the mode of exercising the divine power. On the first day <a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a> a new admission of light into a darkened region, by the partial rarefaction of the intervening medium, is expressed by the word "be." This may denote what already existed, but not in that place. On the second day <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-7</a> a new disposition of the air and the water is described by the verbs "be" and "make." These indicate a modification of what already existed. On the third day <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, <a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a> no verb is directly applied to the act of divine power. This agency is thus understood, while the natural changes following are expressly noticed. In the fourth <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16-17</a> the words "be," "make," and "give" occur, where the matter in hand is the manifestation of the heavenly bodies and their adaptation to the use of man. In these cases it is evident that the word "create" would have been only improperly or indirectly applicable to the action of the Eternal Being. Here it is employed with propriety; as the animal world is something new and distinct summoned into existence. It is manifest from this review that variety of expression has resulted from attention to propriety.<p>Great fishes. - Monstrous crawlers that wriggle through the water or scud along the banks.<p>Every living, breathing thing that creeps. - The smaller animals of the water and its banks.<p>Bird of wing. - Here the wing is made characteristic of the class, which extends beyond what we call birds.

They are further described by their motion, “that moveth.” The Hebrew word denotes the gliding, swift movement of the fish for which there is no adequate English equivalent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX, <span class="greekheb">πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ζώων ἑρπετῶν</span>, gives too restricted a sense and suggests only lizards and reptiles: while the Vulg. <span class="ital">omnem animam viventem atque motabilem</span>, like the R.V., is too general.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which … brought forth abundantly</span>] Better, “with which the waters teemed” or “swarmed.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after their kinds</span>] Cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/context/genesis/1-11.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: and it was so....">Genesis 1:11-12</a></span>; the expression has reference to the great variety of species of water animals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and every winged fowl</span>] or “and every winged flying thing”: LXX <span class="greekheb">πᾶν πετεινὸν πτερωτόν</span>.

Clearly the Israelite drew a very sharp line of distinction between the vegetable and the animal world. Modern science has shewn how infinitely fine is this line; and geology has shewn that, in the earliest rock formations which contain fossils, it is difficult to decide whether vegetable or animal life recedes into the most distant antiquity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God created</span> (<span class="accented">bara</span>, is in ver. 1, to indicate the introduction of an absolutely new thing, viz., the principle of animal life) <span class="cmt_word">great whales</span>. <span class="accented">Tanninim</span>, from <span class="accented">tanan</span>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>; Latin, <span class="accented">tendo</span>; Sansc., <span class="accented">tan</span>, to stretch.

Earlier translators, on the contrary, have rendered the latter as a relative clause, after the &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; of the lxx, "and with birds that fly;" thus making the birds to spring out of the water, in opposition to <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>. Even with regard to the element out of which the water animals were created the text is silent; for the assertion that &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; is to be understood "with a causative colouring" is erroneous, and is not sustained by <a href="/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a> or <a href="/psalms/105-30.htm">Psalm 105:30</a>. The construction with the accusative is common to all verbs of multitude. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, to creep and swarm, is applied, "without regard to size, to those animals which congregate together in great numbers, and move about among one another." &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1490;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, anima viva, living soul, animated beings (vid., <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is in apposition to &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1509;, "swarms consisting of living beings." The expression applies not only to fishes, but to all water animals from the greatest to the least, including reptiles, etc. In carrying out His word, God created (<a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>) the great "tanninim," - lit., the long-stretched, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;, to stretch-whales, crocodiles, and other sea-monsters; and "all moving living beings with which the waters swarm after their kind, and all (every) winged fowl after its kind." That the water animals and birds of every kind were created on the same day, and before the land animals, cannot be explained on the ground assigned by early writers, that there is a similarity between the air and the water, and a consequent correspondence between the two classes of animals. For in the light of natural history the birds are at all events quite as near to the mammalia as to the fishes; and the supposed resemblance between the fins of fishes and the wings of birds, is counterbalanced by the no less striking resemblance between birds and land animals, viz., that both have feet. The real reason is rather this, that the creation proceeds throughout from the lower to the higher; and in this ascending scale the fishes occupy to a great extent a lower place in the animal economy than birds, and both water animals and birds a lower place than land animals, more especially the mammalia. Again, it is not stated that only a single pair was created of each kind; on the contrary, the words, "let the waters swarm with living beings," seem rather to indicate that the animals were created, not only in a rich variety of genera and species, but in large numbers of individuals. The fact that but one human being was created at first, by no means warrants the conclusion that the animals were created singly also; for the unity of the human race has a very different signification from that of the so-called animal species. - (<a href="/genesis/1-22.htm">Genesis 1:22</a>). As animated beings, the water animals and fowls are endowed, through the divine blessing, with the power to be fruitful and multiply. The word of blessing was the actual communication of the capacity to propagate and increase in numbers. </body></html>
