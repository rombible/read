Though they have no love to God's people, they will pretend to it, and try to make a merit of necessity. Foolish Laban! to call those things his gods which could be stolen! Enemies may steal our goods, but not our God. Here Laban lays to Jacob's charge things that he knew not. Those who commit their cause to God, are not forbidden to plead it themselves with meekness and fear. When we read of Rachel's stealing her father's images, what a scene of iniquity opens! The family of Nahor, who left the idolatrous Chaldees; is this family itself become idolatrous? It is even so. The truth seems to be, that they were like some in after-times, who sware by the Lord and by Malcham, Zep 1:5; and like others in our times, who wish to serve both God and mammon. Great numbers will acknowledge the true God in words, but their hearts and houses are the abodes of spiritual idolatry. When a man gives himself up to covetousness, like Laban, the world is his god; and he has only to reside among gross idolaters in order to become one, or at least a favourer of their abominations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Laban's expostulation and Jacob's reply. What hast thou done? Laban intimates that he would have dismissed him honorably and affectionately, and therefore, that his flight was needless and unkind; and finally charges him with stealing his gods. Jacob gives him to understand that he did not expect fair treatment at his hands, and gives him leave to search for his gods, not knowing that Rachel had taken them.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26-30. Laban said &#8230; What hast thou done?&#8212;Not a word is said of the charge (Ge 31:1). His reproaches were of a different kind. His first charge was for depriving him of the satisfaction of giving Jacob and his family the usual salutations at parting. In the East it is customary, when any are setting out to a great distance, for their relatives and friends to accompany them a considerable way with music and valedictory songs. Considering the past conduct of Laban, his complaint on this ground was hypocritical cant. But his second charge was a grave one&#8212;the carrying off his gods&#8212;Hebrew, "teraphim," small images of human figures, used not as idols or objects of worship, but as talismans, for superstitious purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Laban could not be so senseless as to take those for true gods which could be stolen away; but he called them <span class="ital">gods, </span> because they were the means or representations whereby he worshipped his gods. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone,....

The night before he overtook them, he was warned by God in a dream, "not to speak to Jacob from good to bad," i.e., not to say anything decisive and emphatic for the purpose of altering what had already occurred (vid., <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>, and the note on <a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>). Hence he confined himself, when they met, "to bitter reproaches combining paternal feeling on the one hand with hypocrisy on the other;" in which he told them that he had the power to do them harm, if God had not forbidden him, and charged them with stealing his gods (the teraphim). </body></html>
