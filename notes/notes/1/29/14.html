Nobody needs to be ashamed of honest, useful labour, nor ought it to hinder any one's preferment. When Jacob understood that this was his kinswoman, he was very ready to serve her. Laban, though not the best humoured, bade him welcome, and was satisfied with the account Jacob gave of himself. While we avoid being foolishly ready to believe every thing which is told us, we must take heed of being uncharitably suspicious.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob's interview with Rachel, and hospitable reception by Laban. Rachel's approach awakens all Jacob's warmth of feeling. He rolls away the stone, waters the sheep, kisses Rachel, and bursts into tears. The remembrance of home and of the relationship of his mother to Rachel overpowers him. He informs Rachel who he is, and she runs to acquaint her father. Laban hastens to welcome his relative to his house. "Surely my bone and my flesh art thou." This is a description of kinsmanship probably derived from the formation of the woman out of the man <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>.

A similar rule obtained in Laban's establishment, and the wages for which his nephew engaged to continue in his employment was the hand of Rachel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He armed his trained servants, </span> whom he had disciplined and instructed both in religion and in the military art too, both which were necessary to make them good soldiers, that they might both fight with skill and courage, and also rely upon God, and engage his assistance; which was now especially necessary, when so small a party were to engage against so numerous an army. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dan</span> is commonly thought to be a town then called <span class="ital">Leshem, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a></span>, or <span class="ital">Laish, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/18-7.htm" title="Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.">Judges 18:7</a></span>, and afterwards <span class="ital">Dan; </span> see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/18-7.htm" title="Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.">Judges 18:7</a>,29</span>; so it is an anticipation.

When Jacob thereupon told the shepherds to water the flocks and feed them again, for the day was still "great," - i.e., it wanted a long while to the evening, and was not yet time to drive them in (to the folds to rest for the night) - he certainly only wanted to get the shepherds away from the well, that he might meet with his cousin alone. But as Rachel came up in the meantime, he was so carried away by the feelings of relationship, possibly by a certain love at first sight, that he rolled the stone away from the well, watered her flock, and after kissing her, introduced himself with tears of joyous emotion as her cousin (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;, brother, i.e., relation of her father) and Rebekah's son. What the other shepherds thought of all this, is passed over as indifferent to the purpose of the narrative, and the friendly reception of Jacob by Laban is related immediately afterwards. When Jacob had told Laban "all these things," - i.e., hardly "the cause of his journey, and the things which had happened to him in relation to the birthright" (Rosenmller), but simply the things mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2-12</a> - Laban acknowledged him as his relative: "Yes, thou art my bone and my flesh" (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a> and <a href="/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>); and thereby eo ipso ensured him an abode in his house. </body></html>
