Providence brought him to the field where his uncle's flocks were to be watered. What is said of the care of the shepherds for their sheep, may remind us of the tender concern which our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, has for his flock the church; for he is the good Shepherd, that knows his sheep, and is known of them. The stone at the well's mouth was to secure it; water was scarce, it was not there for every one's use: but separate interests should not take us from helping one another. When all the shepherds came together with their flocks, then, like loving neighbours, they watered their flocks together. The law of kindness in the tongue has a commanding power, Pr 31:26. Jacob was civil to these strangers, and he found them civil to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob arrives at the well of Haran. "The land of the sons of the east." The points of the heavens were defined by the usage of practical life, and not by the standard of a science yet unknown. Hence, the east means any quarter toward the sunrising. Haran was about four degrees east of Beer-sheba, and five and a half degrees north. The distance was about four hundred and fifty miles, and therefore it would take Jacob fifteen days to perform the journey at thirty miles a day. If he reached Bethel the first night, he must have travelled about fifty miles the first day. After this he proceeds on his journey without any memorable incident. In the neighborhood of Haran he comes upon a well, by which lay three flocks. This is not the well near Haran where Abraham's servant met Rebekah. It is in the pasture grounds at some distance from the town. On its mouth was a large stone, indicating that water was precious, and that the well was the common property of the surrounding natives. The custom was to gather the flocks, roll away the stone, which was too great to be moved by a boy or a female, water the flocks, and replace the stone. Jacob, on making inquiry, learns that Haran is at hand, that Laban is well, and that Rachel is drawing nigh with her father's flocks. Laban is called by Jacob the son of Nahor, that is, his grandson, with the usual latitude of relative names in Scripture <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>. "The day is great." A great part of it yet remains. It is not yet the time to shut up the cattle for the night; "water the sheep and go feed them." Jacob may have wished to meet with Rachel without presence of the shepherds. "We cannot." There was a rule or custom that the flocks must be all assembled before the stone was rolled away for the purpose of watering the cattle. This may have been required to insure a fair distribution of the water to all parties, and especially to those who were too weak to roll away the stone.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. thither were all the flocks gathered; and a stone, &c.&#8212;In Arabia, owing to the shifting sands and in other places, owing to the strong evaporation, the mouth of a well is generally covered, especially when it is private property. Over many is laid a broad, thick, flat stone, with a round hole cut in the middle, forming the mouth of the cistern. This hole is covered with a heavy stone which it would require two or three men to roll away. Such was the description of the well at Haran.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thither were all the flocks gathered,....

From the middle of ver. 2 the words are parenthetical, the watering of the flocks not having taken place till Rachel had arrived (ver. 9) and Jacob had uncovered the well (ver. 10). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the morning Jacob set up the stone at his head, as a monument (&#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;) to commemorate the revelation he had received from God; and poured oil upon the top, to consecrate it as a memorial of the mercy that had been shown him there (visionis insigne &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Calvin), not as an idol or an object or divine worship (vid., <a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>.). - He then gave the place the name of Bethel, i.e., House of God, whereas (&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;) the town had been called Luz before. This antithesis shows that Jacob gave the name, not to the place where the pillar was set up, but to the town, in the neighbourhood of which he had received the divine revelation. He renewed it on his return from Mesopotamia (<a href="/genesis/35-15.htm">Genesis 35:15</a>). This is confirmed by <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/48-3.htm">Genesis 48:3</a>, where Jacob, like the historian in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/35-6.htm">Genesis 35:6-7</a>, speaks of Luz as the place of this revelation. There is nothing at variance with this in <a href="/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>; for it is not Bethel as a city, but the mountains of Bethel, that are there distinguished from Luz (see my Commentary on <a href="/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>).<p>(Note: The fact mentioned here has often been cited as the origin of the anointed stones (&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) of the heathen, and this heathen custom has been regarded as a degeneration of the patriarchal. But apart from this essential difference, that the Baetulian worship was chiefly connected with meteoric stones (cf. F. von Dalberg, @fcb. d. Meteor-cultus d. Alten), which were supposed to have come down from some god, and were looked upon as deified, this opinion is at variance with the circumstance, that Jacob himself, in consecrating the stone by pouring oil upon it, only followed a custom already established, and still more with the fact, that the name &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, notwithstanding its sounding like Bethel, can hardly have arisen from the name Beth-El, Gr. &#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;, since the &#x3c4; for &#x3b8; would be perfectly inexplicable. Dietrich derives &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; from &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1468;&#1500;, to render inoperative, and interprets it amulet.) </body></html>
