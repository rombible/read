Then, overcome with joy at this happy termination of his long journey, and at finding himself among relatives, he can restrain his feelings no longer, but bursts into tears. In this outburst of emotion we see the commencement of his lifelong affection for the beautiful child whom he thus opportunely met.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:9-14 See Rachel's humility and industry. Nobody needs to be ashamed of honest, useful labour, nor ought it to hinder any one's preferment. When Jacob understood that this was his kinswoman, he was very ready to serve her. Laban, though not the best humoured, bade him welcome, and was satisfied with the account Jacob gave of himself. While we avoid being foolishly ready to believe every thing which is told us, we must take heed of being uncharitably suspicious.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob's interview with Rachel, and hospitable reception by Laban. Rachel's approach awakens all Jacob's warmth of feeling. He rolls away the stone, waters the sheep, kisses Rachel, and bursts into tears. The remembrance of home and of the relationship of his mother to Rachel overpowers him. He informs Rachel who he is, and she runs to acquaint her father. Laban hastens to welcome his relative to his house. "Surely my bone and my flesh art thou." This is a description of kinsmanship probably derived from the formation of the woman out of the man <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>.

While he yet spake with them, Rachel came&#8212;Among the pastoral tribes the young unmarried daughters of the greatest sheiks tend the flocks, going out at sunrise and continuing to watch their fleecy charges till sunset. Watering them, which is done twice a day, is a work of time and labor, and Jacob rendered no small service in volunteering his aid to the young shepherdess. The interview was affecting, the reception welcome, and Jacob forgot all his toils in the society of his Mesopotamian relatives. Can we doubt that he returned thanks to God for His goodness by the way?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jacob kissed Rachel,....

The suddenness of Jacob’s opportune meeting with his relatives, the removal of doubt and anxiety from his mind on entering a strange country, and the apparition of his young and fair cousin, had all deeply stirred his emotional nature. Cf. the tears of Joseph, <a href="/genesis/45-2.htm" title="And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.">Genesis 45:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/45-14.htm" title="And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck.">Genesis 45:14</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob kissed Rachel</span>, - in demonstration of his cousinly affection. If Jacob had not yet discovered who he was to the fair shepherdess, his behavior must have filled her with surprise, even allowing for the unaffected simplicity of the times; but the fact that she does not resent his conduct as an undue liberty perhaps suggests that he had first informed her of his relationship to the inmates of Laban s house (Calvin). On kissing <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/27-26.htm">Genesis 27:26</a> - <span class="cmt_word">and lifted up his voice, and wept</span> - partly for joy in finding his relatives (cf. <a href="/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>; <a href="/genesis/45-2.htm">Genesis 45:2, 14, 15</a>); partly in grateful acknowledgment of God's kindness in conducting him to his mother s brother's house. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jacob asked the shepherds where they lived; from which it is probable that the well was not situated, like that in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24-11.htm">Genesis 24:11</a>, in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of Haran; and when they said they were from Haran, he inquired after Laban, the son, i.e., the descendant, of Nahor, and how he was (&#1500;&#1493; &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;: is he well?; and received the reply, "Well; and behold Rachel, his daughter, is just coming (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; particip.) with the flock." When Jacob thereupon told the shepherds to water the flocks and feed them again, for the day was still "great," - i.e., it wanted a long while to the evening, and was not yet time to drive them in (to the folds to rest for the night) - he certainly only wanted to get the shepherds away from the well, that he might meet with his cousin alone. But as Rachel came up in the meantime, he was so carried away by the feelings of relationship, possibly by a certain love at first sight, that he rolled the stone away from the well, watered her flock, and after kissing her, introduced himself with tears of joyous emotion as her cousin (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1497;, brother, i.e., relation of her father) and Rebekah's son. What the other shepherds thought of all this, is passed over as indifferent to the purpose of the narrative, and the friendly reception of Jacob by Laban is related immediately afterwards. When Jacob had told Laban "all these things," - i.e., hardly "the cause of his journey, and the things which had happened to him in relation to the birthright" (Rosenmller), but simply the things mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2-12</a> - Laban acknowledged him as his relative: "Yes, thou art my bone and my flesh" (cf. <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a> and <a href="/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>); and thereby eo ipso ensured him an abode in his house. </body></html>
