Mutual affection is both the duty and comfort of the married relation; and yoke-fellows should study to recommend themselves to each other, 1Co 7:33,34. She thankfully acknowledges the kind providence of God in hearing her. Whatever supports and comforts us under afflictions, or tends to our deliverance from them, God must be owned in it. Her fourth son she called Judah, or praise, saying, Now will I praise the Lord. This was he, of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came. Whatever is the matter of our rejoicing, ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. Fresh favours should quicken us to praise God for former favours; Now will I praise the Lord more and better than I have done.

"The Lord saw." The eye of the Lord is upon the sufferer. It is remarkable that both the narrator and Leah employ the proper name of God, which makes the performance of promise a prominent feature of his character. This is appropriate in the mouth of Leah, who is the mother of the promised seed. "That Leah was hated" - less loved than Rachel. He therefore recompenses her for the lack of her husband's affections by giving her children, while Rachel was barren. "Reuben" - behold a son. "The Lord hath looked on my affliction." Leah had qualities of heart, if not of outward appearance, which commanded esteem. She had learned to acknowledge the Lord in all her ways. "Simon" - answer. She had prayed to the Lord, and this was her answer. "Levi" - union, the reconciler. Her husband could not, according to the prevailing sentiments of those days, fail to be attached to the mother of three sons. "Judah" - praised. Well may she praise the Lord; for this is the ancestor of the promised seed. It is remarkable that the wife of priority, but not of preference, is the mother of the seed in whom all nations are to be blessed. Levi the reconciler is the father of the priestly tribe. Simon is attached to Judah. Reuben retires into the background.<p>Reuben may have been born when Jacob was still only eighty-four, and consequently Judah was born when Jacob was eighty-seven. <p> - Jacob's Family and Wealth<p>6. &#1491;&#1503;  da&#772;n, Dan, "judge, lord."<p>8. &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1500;&#1497;  napta&#772;l&#305;&#770;y, Naphtali, "wrestling."<p>11. &#1490;&#1491;  ga&#772;d, Gad, "overcoming, victory." &#1489;&#1490;&#1491;  ba&#772;ga&#772;d, "in victory or"  equals &#1490;&#1491; &#1489;&#1488;  ba&#772;' ga&#772;d, "victory cometh." &#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  gu&#770;d, "press down." &#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;  gedu&#770;d, "troop."<p>13. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;  'a&#780;ashe&#772;r, Asher, "prosperity, happiness."<p>18. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1513;&#1499;&#1512;  y&#305;&#770;s&#769;a&#772;ska&#772;r, Jissakar, "reward."

There is, however, an obvious allusion to the thought. "God hath taken away (&#1488;&#1505;&#1507;  'a&#772;sap) my reproach." Double references, we find, are usual in the giving of names (see <a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>).<p>This chapter is the continuation of the former, and completes the history of Jacob in Haran. The event immediately following probably took place after Leah had borne two of her sons, though not admitted into the narrative until she had paused for a short time.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32-35. son &#8230; his name Reuben&#8212;Names were also significant; and those which Leah gave to her sons were expressive of her varying feelings of thankfulness or joy, or allusive to circumstances in the history of the family.

A perfectly worthless excuse; for if this had really been the custom in Haran as in ancient India and elsewhere, he ought to have told Jacob of it before.
