Now, certainly, more is comprised in this blessing than appears at first; it must amount to an entail of the promise of the Messiah: that was, in the patriarchal dialect, <span class="ital">the blessing; </span>something spiritual, doubtless, is included in it. First, That from him should come the Messiah, that should have a sovereign <span class="ital">dominion on earth, </span>See <a href="/numbers/24-19.htm" title="Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remains of the city.">Numbers 24:19</a>, <span class="ital">Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, </span>the <span class="ital">star </span>and <span class="ital">sceptre, </span><a href="/genesis/27-17.htm" title="And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.">Genesis 27:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jacob’s dominion over Esau was to be only typical of this, <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>. Secondly, That from him should come <span class="ital">the Church, </span>that should be particularly owned and favoured <span class="ital">by Heaven. </span>It was part of the blessing of Abraham when he was first called to be the father of the faithful, <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm" title="And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 12:3</a>, <span class="ital">I will bless them that bless thee; </span>therefore, when Isaac afterward confirmed the blessing to Jacob, he called it, the <span class="ital">blessing of Abraham, </span><a href="/genesis/28-4.htm" title="And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you; that you may inherit the land wherein you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.">Genesis 28:4</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:18-29 Jacob, with some difficulty, gained his point, and got the blessing. This blessing is in very general terms. No mention is made of the distinguishing mercies in the covenant with Abraham. This might be owing to Isaac having Esau in his mind, though it was Jacob who was before him. He could not be ignorant how Esau had despised the best things. Moreover, his attachment to Esau, so as to disregard the mind of God, must have greatly weakened his own faith in these things. It might therefore be expected, that leanness would attend his blessing, agreeing with the state of his mind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He gives the kiss of paternal affection, and pronounces the benediction. It contains, first, a fertile soil. "Of the dew of heaven." An abundant measure of this was especially precious in a country where the rain is confined to two seasons of the year. "Of the fatness of the earth;" a proportion of this to match and render available the dew of heaven. "Corn and wine," the substantial products, implying all the rest. Second, a numerous and powerful offspring. "Let peoples serve thee" - pre-eminence among the nations. "Be lord of thy brethren" - pre-eminence among his kindred. Isaac does not seem to have grasped the full meaning of the prediction, "The older shall serve the younger." Third, Prosperity, temporal and spiritual. He that curseth thee be cursed, and he that blesseth thee be blessed. This is the only part of the blessing that directly comprises spiritual things; and even this of a special form. It is to be recollected that it was Isaac's intention to bless Esau, and he may have felt that Esau, after all, was not to be the progenitor of the holy seed. Hence, the form of expression is vague enough to apply to temporal things, and yet sufficiently comprehensive to embrace the infliction of the ban of sin, and the diffusion of the blessing of salvation by means of the holy seed.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. the smell of my son is as of a field&#8212;The aromatic odors of the Syrian fields and meadows, often impart a strong fragrance to the person and clothes, as has been noticed by many travellers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which is full of odoriferous herbs, and flowers, and fruits, and spices, with some of which Esau’s garments might be perfumed in the chest wherein they were laid, as the manner now is.

Jacob came near and kissed Isaac his father: <p>and he smelled the smell of his raiment; which being not like the smell of a sheep coat, but of a field, might give him more full satisfaction that it was truly Esau: <p>and he blessed him; with his patriarchal and prophetic blessing, which here begins: <p>and said, see, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed; like a field fall of fragrant herbs, flowers, and spices, watered with the dews and rain of heaven, and so made fruitful, which emits a most, delightful odour; this may respect the scent of Esau's clothes, now on Jacob's back, which they received from the fields, which Esau continually frequented; or rather from the odoriferous herbs and fruits which were put among them in the chest, in which Rebekah had laid them up; and it may be, that whereas the goatskins on his hands and neck would be apt to send forth a rank and disagreeable smell, these might be so scented by Rebekah as to prevent that. Some render these words, "see the smell of my son, whom the Lord hath blessed (w), as the smell of a field"; and so Isaac pronounces him blessed of the Lord, as well as by himself; the sense is the same: as to the smell many interpreters consider this as a type and figure of the acceptance of believers with God, being clothed with the goodly, excellent, and desirable garment of the righteousness of Christ their elder brother, even of their persons, services, and sacrifices; which is indeed truly spiritual and evangelical; but is liable to this objection, that it makes profane Esau a type of Christ. I see not that anything can well be objected to the application of this son of Isaac's to the Messiah himself, whom he may have a special regard unto in this prophetic blessing, reading the words, "the smell of my son shall be as the smell of a field": or "my son, whom the Lord hath blessed", and came before with all the blessings of goodness, and in whom all nations shall be blessed, shall be "as the smell of a field"; all whose garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia, <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>, even Isaac's principal son, that should be of his seed, of whom Jacob his present son was a type, and who was to spring from him. <p>(w) So Junius, Tremellius, Gesner. &amp; Walther. apud Calov. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">he smelled</span>] The scent of the “field” forms the starting-point of the Oracle, or Song, of Blessing. The blessing is concerned not with the personal destiny of Jacob, but with the national history of the Israelite people. Cf. the blessing of Jacob on Joseph (<a href="/genesis/49-22.htm" title="Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:">Genesis 49:22</a> ff.).

And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.">Genesis 27:5</a>, the country of the huntsman.

The two clauses in this verse serve as a prelude to the blessing of <span class="ital"><a href="/context/genesis/27-28.htm" title="Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:...">Genesis 27:28-29</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he came near, and kissed him</span>. Originally the act of kissing had a symbolical character. Here it is a sign of affection between a parent and a child; in <a href="/genesis/29-13.htm">Genesis 29:13</a> between relatives. It was also a token of friendship (Tobit 7. 6; 10:12; <a href="/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48</a>; <a href="/luke/7-45.htm">Luke 7:45</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>; <a href="/acts/20-37.htm">Acts 20:37</a>). The kissing of princes was a symbol of homage (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>; Xenoph., 'Cyrop.,' 7. 5, 32). With the Persians it was a mark of honor (Xenoph., 'Agesil.,' 5. 4). The Rabbins permitted only three kinds of kisses - the kiss of reverence, of reception, and of dismissal. The kiss of charity was practiced among disciples in the early Christian Church (<a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-20.htm">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-14.htm">1 Peter 5:14</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Kitto's' 'Cyclopedia,' art. Kissing). <span class="cmt_word">And he smelled the smell of his raiment</span>, - not deliberately, in order to detect whether they belonged to a shepherd or a huntsman (Tuch), but accidentally while, in the act of kissing. The odor of Esau s garments, impregnated with the fragrance of the aromatic herbs of Palestine, excited the dull sensibilities of the aged prophet, suggesting to his mind pictures of freshness and fertility, and inspiring him to pour forth his promised benediction - <span class="cmt_word">and blessed him</span> (not a second time, the statement in ver. 23 being only inserted by anticipation), <span class="cmt_word">and said</span>, - the blessing, as is usual in elevated prophetic utterances, assumes a poetic and antistrophical form (cf. Esau's blessing, vers. 39, 40) - <span class="cmt_word">See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field</span> - the first clause of the poetic stanza clearly connects with the odor of Esau's raiment as that which had opened the fount of prophetic song in Isaac's breast, so far at least as its peculiar form was concerned; its secret inspiration we know was the Holy Ghost operating through Isaac's faith in the promise (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">which the Lord hath blessed</span>. The introduction of the name Jehovah instead of Elohim in this second clause proves that Isaac did not mean to liken his son to an ordinary well-cultivated field, but to "<span class="accented">a</span> field like that of Paradise, resplendent with traces of the Deity - an ideal field, bearing the same relation to an ordinary one as Israel did to the heathen - a kind of enchanted garden, such as would be realized at a later period in Canaan, as far as the fidelity of the people permitted it" (Hengstenberg). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Jacob had no easy task to perform before his father. As soon as he had spoken on entering, his father asked him, "Who art thou, my son?" On his replying, "I am Esau, thy first-born," the father expressed his surprise at the rapid success of his hunting; and when he was satisfied with the reply, "Jehovah thy God sent it (the thing desired) to meet me," he became suspicious about the voice, and bade him come nearer, that he might feel him. But as his hands appeared hairy like Esau's, he did not recognise him; and "so he blessed him." In this remark (<a href="/genesis/27-23.htm">Genesis 27:23</a>) the writer gives the result of Jacob's attempt; so that the blessing is merely mentioned proleptically here, and refers to the formal blessing described afterwards, and not to the first greeting and salutation. </body></html>
