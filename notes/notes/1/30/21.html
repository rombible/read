"Mandrakes" - the fruit of the "mandragora vernaIis," which is to this day supposed to promote fruitfulness of the womb. Rachel therefore desires to partake of them, and obtains them by a compact with Leah. Leah betakes herself to prayer, and bears a fifth son. She calls him "Issakar," with a double allusion. She had hired her husband with the mandrakes, and had received this son as her hire for giving her maid to her husband; which she regards as an act of generosity or self-denial. "Zebulun." Here Leah confesses, "God hath endowed me with a good dowry." She speaks now like Rachel of the God of nature.

They are about the size of a nutmeg, with a strong and agreeable odour, and were used by the ancients, as they still are by the Arabs, as a means of promoting child-bearing. To Rachel's request that she would give her some, Leah replied (<a href="/genesis/30-15.htm">Genesis 30:15</a>): "Is it too little, that thou hast taken (drawn away from me) my husband, to take also" (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514; infin.), i.e., that thou wouldst also take, "my son's mandrakes?" At length she parted with them, on condition that Rachel would let Jacob sleep with her the next night. After relating how Leah conceived again, and Rachel continued barren in spite of the mandrakes, the writer justly observes (<a href="/genesis/30-17.htm">Genesis 30:17</a>), "Elohim hearkened unto Leah," to show that it was not from such natural means as love-apples, but from God the author of life, that she had received such fruitfulness. Leah saw in the birth of her fifth son a divine reward for having given her maid to her husband - a recompense, that is, for her self-denial; and she named him on that account Issaschar, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange form, to be understood either according to the Chethib &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; "there is reward," or according to the Keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; "he bears (brings) reward." At length she bore her sixth son, and named him Zebulun, i.e., "dwelling;" for she hoped that now, after God had endowed her with a good portion, her husband, to whom she had born six sons, would dwell with her, i.e., become more warmly attached to her. The name is from &#1494;&#1489;&#1500; to dwell, with acc. constr. "to inhabit," formed with a play upon the alliteration in the word &#1494;&#1489;&#1491; to present - two &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;. In connection with these two births, Leah mentions Elohim alone, the supernatural giver, and not Jehovah, the covenant God, whose grace had been forced out of her heart by jealousy. She afterwards bore a daughter, Dinah, who is mentioned simply because of the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; for, according to <a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a>, Jacob had several daughters, though they were nowhere mentioned by name. </body></html>
