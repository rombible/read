Wool, as the chief material for clothing, is a very valuable commodity in the East, and by the sale of it Jacob would obtain means for the purchase of male and female servants and camels. The latter were especially valuable for purposes of commerce, in which Jacob evidently was actively engaged, and whence probably came his chief gains.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/30-43.htm" title="And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.">Genesis 30:43</a></span>. <span class="ital">The man increased exceedingly — </span>Upon the whole of what is said here, and in the following chapter, we may conclude that Jacob’s behaviour in this affair was generous, fair, and candid; that he chose the ring-streaked cattle with a view to prevent disputes, trusting that God would so order it, agreeably to his petition at Beth-el, that he should have enough, being determined to be content with what God’s providence should give him; and that, when he made use of the rods, it was an act of faith, and in obedience to God’s command. We have the more reason to think this, because we find nothing but good arose to Jacob from it; whereas, we may remark, that though the Scripture often mentions the misconduct of good men, yet it always takes care to inform us, that evil arose to them in consequence of such actions. We may observe also God’s faithfulness; he had promised <span class="ital">Jacob at Beth-el </span>to be with him in all places whither he should go; and we find him accordingly blessing Laban because he was with him: so that, though Laban had but little when Jacob came to him, it was, under him, increased to a multitude. We ought likewise to take notice that, though Jacob, from what he says to Laban in the following chapter, appears to have been a most industrious, faithful servant, yet he attributes all the increase of the flock to the blessing of God, and not to his own care.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:25-43 The fourteen years being gone, Jacob was willing to depart without any provision, except God's promise. But he had in many ways a just claim on Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob devises means to provide himself with a flock in these unfavorable circumstances. His first device is to place party-colored rods before the eyes of the cattle at the rutting season, that they might drop lambs and kids varied with speckles, patches, or streaks of white. He had learned from experience that there is a congruence between the colors of the objects contemplated by the dams at that season and those of their young. At all events they bare many straked, speckled, and spotted lambs and kids. He now separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flock toward the young of the rare colors, doubtless to affect them in the same way as the pilled rods. "Put his own folds by themselves." These are the party-colored cattle that from time to time appeared in the flock of Laban. In order to secure the stronger cattle, Jacob added the second device of employing the party-colored rods only when the strong cattle conceived. The sheep in the East lamb twice a year, and it is supposed that the lambs dropped in autumn are stronger than those dropped in the spring. On this supposition Jacob used his artifice in the spring, and not in the autumn. It is probable, however, that he made his experiments on the healthy and vigorous cattle, without reference to the season of the year. The result is here stated. "The man brake forth exceedingly" - became rapidly rich in hands and cattle.<p>It is obvious that the preceding and present chapters form one continuous piece of composition; as otherwise we have no account of the whole family of Jacob from one author.

This word occurs fifteen times in the Old Testament. It appears three times in this chapter, and nowhere else in the Pentateuch. It is always in the plural number. The root does not appear in Biblical Hebrew. It perhaps means "to live well," intransitively (Gesenius, Roedig.), "to nourish," transitively (Furst). The teraphim were symbols or representatives of the Deity, as Laban calls them his gods. They seem to have been busts (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;  protomai, Aquila) of the human form, sometimes as large as life <a href="/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>.

He undertook that himself, probably to make more sure, and then gave those which were set apart as Jacob's wages to his own sons to tend, since it was Jacob's duty to take care of Laban's flock, and "set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob," i.e., between the flock to be tended by himself through his sons, and that to be tended by Jacob, for the purpose of preventing any copulation between the animals of the two flocks. Nevertheless he was overreached by Jacob, who adopted a double method of increasing the wages agreed upon. In the first place (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37-39</a>), he took fresh rods of storax, maple, and walnut-trees, all of which have a dazzling white wood under their dark outside, and peeled white stripes upon them, &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1503; &#1502;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507; (the verbal noun instead of the inf. abs. &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1507;), "peeling the white naked in the rods." These partially peeled, and therefore mottled rods, he placed in the drinking-troughs (&#1512;&#1492;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; lit., gutters, from &#1512;&#1492;&#1496;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; to run, is explained by &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; water-troughs), to which the flock came to drink, in front of the animals, in order that, if copulation took place at the drinking time, it might occur near the mottled sticks, and the young be speckled and spotted in consequence. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; a rare, antiquated form for &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; from &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; imperf. Kal of &#1497;&#1495;&#1501;  equals  &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;. This artifice was founded upon a fact frequently noticed, particularly in the case of sheep, that whatever fixes their attention in copulation is marked upon the young (see the proofs in Bochart, Hieroz. 1, 618, and Friedreich zur Bibel 1, 37ff.). - Secondly (<a href="/genesis/30-40.htm">Genesis 30:40</a>), Jacob separated the speckled animals thus obtained from those of a normal colour, and caused the latter to feed so that the others would be constantly in sight, in order that he might in this way obtain a constant accession of mottled sheep. As soon as these had multiplied sufficiently, he formed separate flocks (viz., of the speckled additions), "and put them not unto Laban's cattle;" i.e., he kept them apart in order that a still larger number of speckled ones might be procured, through Laban's one-coloured flock having this mottled group constantly in view. </body></html>
