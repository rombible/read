She considered not that God made the difference, and that in other things she had the advantage. Let us carefully watch against all the risings and workings of this passion in our minds. Let not our eye be evil towards any of our fellow-servants, because our Master's is good. Jacob loved Rachel, and therefore reproved her for what she said amiss. Faithful reproofs show true affection. God may be to us instead of any creature; but it is sin and folly to place any creature in God's stead, and to place that confidence in any creature, which should be placed in God only. At the persuasion of Rachel, Jacob took Bilhah her handmaid to wife, that, according to the usage of those times, her children might be owned as her mistress's children. Had not Rachel's heart been influenced by evil passions, she would have thought her sister's children nearer to her, and more entitled to her care than Bilhah's. But children whom she had a right to rule, were more desirable to her than children she had more reason to love. As an early instance of her power over these children, she takes pleasure in giving them names that carry in them marks of rivalry with her sister. See what roots of bitterness envy and strife are, and what mischief they make among relations. At the persuasion of Leah, Jacob took Zilpah her handmaid to wife also. See the power of jealousy and rivalship, and admire the wisdom of the Divine appointment, which joins together one man and one woman only; for God hath called us to peace and purity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bilhah, Rachel's maid, bears two sons. Rachel becomes impatient of her barrenness and jealous of her sister, and unjustly reproaches her husband, who indignantly rebukes her. God, not he, has withheld children from her. She does what Sarah had done before her <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2-3</a>, gives her handmaid to her husband. No express law yet forbade this course, though nature and Scripture by implication did <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23-25</a>. "Dan." "God hath judged me." In this passage Jacob and Rachel use the common noun, God, the Everlasting, and therefore Almighty, who rules in the physical relations of things - a name suitable to the occasion. He had judged her, dealt with her according to his sovereign justice in withholding the fruit of the womb, when she was self-complacent and forgetful of her dependence on a higher power; and also in hearing her voice when she approached him in humble supplication. "Naphtali." "Wrestlings of God," with God, in prayer, on the part of both sisters, so that they wrestled with one another in the self-same act. Rachel, though looking first to Jacob and then to her maid, had at length learned to look to her God, and then had prevailed.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-9. Bilhah &#8230; Zilpah&#8212;Following the example of Sarah with regard to Hagar, an example which is not seldom imitated still, she adopted the children of her maid. Leah took the same course. A bitter and intense rivalry existed between them, all the more from their close relationship as sisters; and although they occupied separate apartments, with their families, as is the uniform custom where a plurality of wives obtains, and the husband and father spends a day with each in regular succession, that did not allay their mutual jealousies. The evil lies in the system, which being a violation of God's original ordinance, cannot yield happiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God hath judged me, </span> pleaded my cause, or given sentence for me, as this phrase is oft taken. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Rachel said,....

The employment of Elohim by Jacob and Rachel, supposed to mark the first thirteen verses as belonging to the primitive document (Tuch, Bleek, Kalisch), though by others (Davidson, Colenso) they are ascribed to the Jehovist, is sufficiently explained by Rachers consciousness that in a large measure her handmaid's son was rather the fruit of her own impious device than the gift of Jehovah (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore called she his name Dan</span> - i.e. "Judge," one decreeing justice, <span class="accented">vindex</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span>, to judge (Gesenius, Keil, Lange, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), though, as in other proper names, e.g. Joseph, Zebulun, in which two verbs are alluded to, Michaelis thinks non <span class="accented">ajudicando solum</span>, <span class="accented">sed et ab audiendo nomen accepisse Danem</span>, and connects it with another verb, a denominative from an Arabic root, signifying to hear (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Suppl.,' p. 425). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Leah's First Sons. - Jacob's sinful weakness showed itself even after his marriage, in the fact that he loved Rachel more than Leah; and the chastisement of God, in the fact that the hated wife was blessed with children, whilst Rachel for a long time remained unfruitful. By this it was made apparent once more, that the origin of Israel was to be a work not of nature, but of grace. Leah had four sons in rapid succession, and gave them names which indicated her state of mind: (1) Reuben, "see, a son!" because she regarded his birth as a pledge that Jehovah had graciously looked upon her misery, for now her husband would love her; (2) Simeon, i.e., "hearing," for Jehovah had heard, i.e., observed that she was hated; (3) Levi, i.e., attachment, for she hoped that this time, at least, after she had born three sons, her husband would become attached to her, i.e., show her some affection; (4) Judah (&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, verbal, of the fut. hoph. of &#1497;&#1491;&#1492;), i.e., praise, not merely the praised one, but the one for whom Jehovah is praised. After this fourth birth there was a pause (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>), that she might not be unduly lifted up by her good fortune, or attribute to the fruitfulness of her own womb what the faithfulness of Jehovah, the covenant God had bestowed upon her. </body></html>
