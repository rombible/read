It is courtly and complimentary, but utterly inconclusive. “If now I have found favour in thine eyes, I have a feeling that God hath blessed me for thy sake.” It, of course, suggests that he would be glad if Jacob would remain with him.

But he had in many ways a just claim on Laban's substance, and it was the will of God that he should be provided for from it. He referred his cause to God, rather than agree for stated wages with Laban, whose selfishness was very great. And it would appear that he acted honestly, when none but those of the colours fixed upon should be found among his cattle. Laban selfishly thought that his cattle would produce few different in colour from their own. Jacob's course after this agreement has been considered an instance of his policy and management. But it was done by intimation from God, and as a token of his power. The Lord will one way or another plead the cause of the oppressed, and honour those who simply trust his providence. Neither could Laban complain of Jacob, for he had nothing more than was freely agreed that he should have; nor was he injured, but greatly benefitted by Jacob's services. May all our mercies be received with thanksgiving and prayer, that coming from his bounty, they may lead to his praise.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jacob enters into a new contract of service with Laban. "When Rachel had borne Joseph." Jacob cannot ask his dismissal until the twice seven years of service were completed. Hence, the birth of Joseph, which is the date of his request, took place at the earliest in the fifteenth year of his sojourn with Laban. Jacob now wishes to return home, from which he had been detained so long by serving for Rachel. He no doubt expects of Laban the means at least of accomplishing his journey. Laban is loath to part with him. "I have divined" - I have been an attentive observer. The result of his observation is expressed in the following words. "Appoint." Laban offers to leave the fixing of the hire to Jacob. "Thy hire upon me," which I will take upon me as binding. Jacob touches upon the value of his services, perhaps with the tacit feeling that Laban in equity owed him at least the means of returning to his home. "Brake forth" - increased. "At my foot" - under my guidance and tending of thy flocks.<p>"Do" - provide. "Thou shalt not give me anything." This shows that Jacob had no stock from Laban to begin with. "I will pass through all thy flock today" with thee. "Remove thou thence every speckled and spotted sheep, and every brown sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats." These were the rare colors, as in the East the sheep are usually white, and the goats black or dark brown. "And such shall be my hire." Such as these uncommon party-colored cattle, when they shall appear among the flock already cleared of them; and not those of this description that are now removed. For in this case Laban would have given Jacob something; whereas Jacob was resolved to be entirely dependent on the divine providence for his hire. "And my righteousness will answer for me." The color will determine at once whose the animal is. Laban willingly consents to so favorable a proposal, removes the party-colored animals from the flock, gives them into the hands of his sons, and puts an interval of three days' journey between them and the pure stock which remains in Jacob's hands. Jacob is now to begin with nothing, and have for his hire any party-colored lambs or kids that appear in those flocks, from which every specimen of this rare class has been carefully removed.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. Laban said &#8230; I have learned&#8212;His selfish uncle was averse to a separation, not from warmth of affection either for Jacob or his daughters, but from the damage his own interests would sustain. He had found, from long observation, that the blessing of heaven rested on Jacob, and that his stock had wonderfully increased under Jacob's management. This was a remarkable testimony that good men are blessings to the places where they reside. Men of the world are often blessed with temporal benefits on account of their pious relatives, though they have not always, like Laban, the wisdom to discern, or the grace to acknowledge it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry,....

They are about the size of a nutmeg, with a strong and agreeable odour, and were used by the ancients, as they still are by the Arabs, as a means of promoting child-bearing. To Rachel's request that she would give her some, Leah replied (<a href="/genesis/30-15.htm">Genesis 30:15</a>): "Is it too little, that thou hast taken (drawn away from me) my husband, to take also" (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514; infin.), i.e., that thou wouldst also take, "my son's mandrakes?" At length she parted with them, on condition that Rachel would let Jacob sleep with her the next night. After relating how Leah conceived again, and Rachel continued barren in spite of the mandrakes, the writer justly observes (<a href="/genesis/30-17.htm">Genesis 30:17</a>), "Elohim hearkened unto Leah," to show that it was not from such natural means as love-apples, but from God the author of life, that she had received such fruitfulness. Leah saw in the birth of her fifth son a divine reward for having given her maid to her husband - a recompense, that is, for her self-denial; and she named him on that account Issaschar, &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;, a strange form, to be understood either according to the Chethib &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; "there is reward," or according to the Keri &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; "he bears (brings) reward." At length she bore her sixth son, and named him Zebulun, i.e., "dwelling;" for she hoped that now, after God had endowed her with a good portion, her husband, to whom she had born six sons, would dwell with her, i.e., become more warmly attached to her. The name is from &#1494;&#1489;&#1500; to dwell, with acc. constr. "to inhabit," formed with a play upon the alliteration in the word &#1494;&#1489;&#1491; to present - two &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;. In connection with these two births, Leah mentions Elohim alone, the supernatural giver, and not Jehovah, the covenant God, whose grace had been forced out of her heart by jealousy. She afterwards bore a daughter, Dinah, who is mentioned simply because of the account in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; for, according to <a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a>, Jacob had several daughters, though they were nowhere mentioned by name. </body></html>
