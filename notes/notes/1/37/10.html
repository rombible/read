Joseph’s dream seemed to violate the respect due to parents. As Jacob probably regarded his son’s dreams as the result of his letting his fancy dwell upon ideas of self-exaltation, he rightly rebuked him; while, nevertheless, “observing his saying.” (Comp. <a href="/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thy mother.</span>—Rachel was certainly dead, as Joseph had at this time eleven brethren. Nor did Leah ever bow down before him; for she died at Hebron (<a href="/genesis/49-31.htm" title="There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.">Genesis 49:31</a>). The enumeration of “sun, moon, and stars,” means Jacob, his wives, and his children, that is, the whole family, elders and juniors, were to make obeisance to Joseph. It is a general phrase, like that in <a href="/genesis/35-26.htm" title="And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.">Genesis 35:26</a>, and is not to be too literally interpreted. But as the handmaids were both of them younger than either Rachel or Leah, they may have gone down with Jacob into Egypt; and probably Bilhah had done a mother’s part by Joseph after Rachel’s death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/37.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/37-10.htm" title="And he told it to his father, and to his brothers: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed?

In his thus rebuking him, although in regard to Joseph without cause, Jacob is an example worthy of the imitation of all parents, who, when they observe any appearance of arrogance, self-exaltation, or aspiring after high things in any of their children, ought always to check it, as being a sinful disposition, and often productive of very evil consequences. <span class="ital">Shall I and thy mother — </span>Leah, his step-mother, one that filled his mother’s place, and was now Jacob’s only wife, and the mother of the family.

Observe, Joseph dreamed of his preferment, but he did not dream of his imprisonment. Thus many young people, when setting out in the world, think of nothing but prosperity and pleasure, and never dream of trouble. His brethren rightly interpreted the dream, though they abhorred the interpretation of it. While they committed crimes in order to defeat it, they were themselves the instruments of accomplishing it. Thus the Jews understood what Christ said of his kingdom. Determined that he should not reign over them, they consulted to put him to death; and by his crucifixion, made way for the exaltation they designed to prevent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph's dreams excite the jealousy of his brothers. His frankness in reciting his dream to his brothers marks a spirit devoid of guile, and only dimly conscious of the import of his nightly visions. The first dream represents by a figure the humble submission of all his brothers to him, as they rightly interpret it. "For his dreams and for his words." The meaning of this dream was offensive enough, and his telling of it rendered it even more disagreeable. A second dream is given to express the certainty of the event <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>. The former serves to interpret the latter. There the sheaves are connected with the brothers who bound them, and thereby indicate the parties. The eleven stars are not so connected with them. But here Joseph is introduced directly without a figure, and the number eleven, taken along with the eleven sheaves of the former dream, makes the application to the brothers plain. The sun and moon clearly point out the father and mother. The mother is to be taken, we conceive, in the abstract, without nicely inquiring whether it means the departed Rachel, or the probably still living Leah. Not even the latter seems to have lived to see the fulfillment of this prophetic dream <a href="/genesis/49-31.htm">Genesis 49:31</a>. The second dream only aggravated the hatred of his brothers; but his father, while rebuking him for his speeches, yet marked the saying. The rebuke seems to imply that the dream, or the telling of it, appears to his father to indicate the lurking of a self-sufficient or ambitious spirit within the breast of the youthful Joseph. The twofold intimation, however, came from a higher source.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 37:5-36. The Dreams of Joseph.<p>5. Joseph dreamed a dream&#8212;Dreams in ancient times were much attended to, and hence the dream of Joseph, though but a mere boy, engaged the serious consideration of his family. But this dream was evidently symbolical. The meaning was easily discerned, and, from its being repeated under different emblems, the fulfilment was considered certain (compare Ge 41:32), whence it was that "his brethren envied him, but his father observed the saying" [Ge 37:11].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His father rebuked him; </span> not through anger at Joseph, or contempt of his dream, for it follows, he <span class="ital">observed it; </span> but partly lest Joseph should be puffed up upon the account of his dreams, and principally to allay the envy and hatred of his brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thy mother:</span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Leah, his stepmother, one that filled his mother’s place, being now Jacob’s only wife, and the mother of the family. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he told it to his father, and to his brethren,.... After he had told it to his brethren, he told it to his father a second time in their hearing, that he might pass his judgment on it, and give his sense of it before them: <p>and his father rebuked him; not as being ignorant of the meaning of the dream, for by what follows he had a clear understanding of it, or as if he thought it was an idle dream, and would never have any accomplishment: but he thought fit, in his great wisdom and prudence, to put on such an air, partly to check young Joseph, lest he should grow proud, and haughty, and insolent upon it, and behave in a disagreeable manner to himself and to his brethren; and partly to conciliate the minds of his brethren to him, which he perceived were exasperated by his dreams: <p>and said unto him, what is this dream that thou hast dreamed? what dost thou take to be the meaning of it? canst thou imagine that it is of God? is it not a mere whim and imagination of thine own wandering brain in thy sleep? why dost thou tell such an idle dream as this, as if there were something divine in it, when it appears the most absurd and irrational? <p>shall I, thy mother, and thy brethren, indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? whereby it plainly shows he understood the meaning of the dream, though he would not seem to countenance it. By the "sun" he understood himself, the principal and head of the family, the active instrument of the generation of it, the light, life, and support of it; and by the "moon" his wife, the passive instrument of generation, who had the lesser share of rule in the family, yet contributed much to its good and welfare; by whom is meant not Rachel, the real mother of Joseph, who was dead, unless this is observed to show the seeming absurdity of it, from whence the whole might appear ridiculous; but rather Leah, who was now Jacob's only true wife, and the stepmother of Joseph; or else Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, who since her death was a mother to Joseph; and by the eleven "stars" he understood the eleven brethren of Joseph, who were as stars that receive their light from the sun; and in allusion to the twelve constellations in the Zodiac, to which Joseph and his eleven brethren answered. This had its fulfilment, in some measure, when Jacob sent presents to Joseph when governor of Egypt, though unknown to him, and when he and his family went thither, when, no doubt, Jacob showed a civil respect according to his dignity, and in regard to the office he bore: and so his wife, if he then had any, that went with him, and if not personally, yet in her posterity paid a deference to him, as it is certain all his brethren did. Grotius observes from the Oneirocritics or interpreters of dreams, particularly Achmes, that according to the doctrine of the Persians and Egyptians, that if anyone should dream that he rules over the stars, he shall rule over all people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he told <i>it</i> to his father, and to his brethren: and his father <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> rebuked him, and said unto him, What <i>is</i> this dream that thou hast dreamed?
