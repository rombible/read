Thirdly, Canon Cook, in the “Excursus on Egyptian Words,” at the end of Vol. I. of <span class= "ital">The Speaker’s Commentary, </span>argues with much cogency, that it means “father of the palace.” This again would be an official name.<p><span class= "bld">An officer.</span>—Though this word literally in Hebrew signifies an eunuch, yet either, as seems probable from other places, it had come to mean any officer of the palace, or Potiphar was chief of the eunuchs, and therefore is himself numbered among them.<p><span class= "bld">Captain of the guard.</span>—Heb., <span class= "ital">chief of the slaughterers, </span>by which the LXX. understand the slaughterers of animals for food, and translate “chief cook.” The other versions understand by it the commander of the king’s body-guard, whose business it would be to execute condemned criminals.

Joseph's brethren kept their own and one another's counsel for some time; but their villany came to light at last, and it is here published to the world. To grieve their father, they sent him Joseph's coat of colours; and he hastily thought, on seeing the bloody coat, that Joseph was rent in pieces. Let those that know the heart of a parent, suppose the agony of poor Jacob. His sons basely pretended to comfort him, but miserable, hypocritical comforters were they all. Had they really desired to comfort him, they might at once have done it, by telling the truth. The heart is strangely hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Jacob refused to be comforted. Great affection to any creature prepares for so much the greater affliction, when it is taken from us, or made bitter to us: undue love commonly ends in undue grief. It is the wisdom of parents not to bring up children delicately, they know not to what hardships they may be brought before they die. From the whole of this chapter we see with wonder the ways of Providence. The malignant brothers seem to have gotten their ends; the merchants, who care not what they deal in so that they gain, have also obtained theirs; and Potiphar, having got a fine young slave, has obtained his! But God's designs are, by these means, in train for execution. This event shall end in Israel's going down to Egypt; that ends in their deliverance by Moses; that in setting up the true religion in the world; and that in the spread of it among all nations by the gospel. Thus the wrath of man shall praise the Lord, and the remainder thereof will he restrain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The brothers contrive to conceal their crime; and Joseph is sold into Egypt. "Torn, torn in pieces is Joseph." The sight of the bloody coat convinces Jacob at once that Joseph has been devoured by a wild beast. "All his daughters." Only one daughter of Jacob is mentioned by name. These are probably his daughters-in-law. "To the grave." Sheol is the place to which the soul departs at death. It is so called from its ever craving, or being empty. "Minister." This word originally means eunuch, and then, generally, any officer about the court or person of the sovereign. "Captain of the guards." The guards are the executioners of the sentences passed by the sovereign on culprits, which were often arbitrary, summary, and extremely severe. It is manifest, from this dark chapter, that the power of sin has not been extinguished in the family of Jacob. The name of God does not appear, and his hand is at present only dimly seen among the wicked designs, deeds, and devices of these unnatural brothers. Nevertheless, his counsel of mercy standeth sure, and fixed is his purpose to bring salvation to the whole race of man, by means of his special covenant with Abraham. <p> - The Family of Judah<p>1. &#1506;&#1491;&#1500;&#1501;  &#8219;a&#780;du&#770;lla&#770;m, 'Adullam, "righteousness." &#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;  ch&#305;&#770;yra&#770;h Chirah, "nobility?"<p>2. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;  shu&#770;a&#8219;, Shua', "luck, riches, cry."<p>3. &#1506;&#1512;  &#8219;e&#770;r, 'Er, "watching."<p>4. &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;  'o&#770;na&#770;n, Onan, "strong."<p>5. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;  she&#772;la&#770;h, Shelah, "request? rest." &#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1489;  kez&#305;&#770;yb Kezib, "falsehood."<p>6. &#1514;&#1502;&#1512;  ta&#772;ma&#772;r, Tamar, "palm."<p>12. &#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  t&#305;&#770;mna&#770;h, Timnah, "counted or assigned."<p>14. &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#770;ynay&#305;&#770;m, 'Enaim, "two fountains."<p>29. &#1508;&#1512;&#1509;  perets, Perets, "breach."<p>This strange narrative is an episode in the history of Joseph; but an integral part of the "generations" of Jacob. It is loosely dated with the phrase "at that time." This does not indicate a sequel to the preceding record, the proper phrase for which is "after these things" (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1495;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;  'achar hadeba&#772;r&#305;&#770;ym ha&#770;'e&#772;leh <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>). It implies rather a train of events that commenced at least in the past, some time before the closing incident of the previous narrative <a href="/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>. But the sale of Joseph, which alone is recorded in the last chapter, only occupied some few weeks or months of a year. Hence, the circumstances contained in this memoir of Judah's family must have taken their rise before that event. The date "at that time," is rendered indefinite also by being attached to the phrase, "And it came to pass," which covers at least all the events in the first eleven verses of the chapter.<p>All this is in accordance with the customary mode of arranging parallel lines of events in Hebrew narrative. We shall see reason afterward for placing the birth of Er at as early a date as possible in the life of Judah <a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>. Now Judah, we conceive, was born when his father was eighty-seven, and Joseph when he was ninety-one, and hence, there is a difference about four years in their ages. We suppose Er to have been born in Judah's fourteenth year, when Joseph and Dinah were in their tenth, and therefore, about three years before the rape of Dinah, and shortly after Jacob arrived at the town of Shekem. The dishonor of Dinah, and the cruel treatment of Joseph, being of essential moment in the process of things, had to be recorded in the main line of events. The commencement of Judah's family, having no particular influence on the current of the history, is fitly reserved until the whole of the circumstances could be brought together into a connected narrative. And the private history of Judah's line is given, while that of the others is omitted, simply because from him the promised seed is descended. As soon as Jacob is settled in the promised land, the contact with Hebron and its neighborhood seems to have commenced. A clear proof of this is the presence of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, in Jacob's family <a href="/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>. The great thoroughfare from Damascus to Egypt runs through Shekem and Hebron, and we know that when Jacob was residing at Hebron, his sons fed their flocks at Shekem and Dothan, and the youthful Joseph was sent to inquire after their welfare.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son&#8212;not the earth, for Joseph was supposed to be torn in pieces, but the unknown place&#8212;the place of departed souls, where Jacob expected at death to meet his beloved son.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whose office it was to apprehend and punish criminal persons.

Joseph was a most eminent type of Christ, and there are so many things in this chapter which show an agreement between them that cannot be passed over. Joseph was the son of his father's old age, Christ the son of the Ancient of days; Joseph was in a peculiar manner beloved by his father, Christ is the dear son of his Father's love; Jacob made for Joseph a coat of many colours, God prepared a body in human nature for Christ, filled and adorned with the various gifts and graces of the Spirit without measure. Joseph was hated by his brethren, and they could not endure to think he should have the dominion over them. The Jews, of whom Christ was according to the flesh, hated him, and would not have him to reign over them; Joseph was sent by his father a long journey to visit his brethren, and know the welfare of them and their flocks, Christ was sent from heaven to earth to seek and save the lost sheep of the house of Israel; Joseph's brethren, when they saw him come to them, conspired to take away his life, the Jews, who were Christ's own, when he came to them, received him not, but said, this is the heir, let us kill him, and they consulted to take away his life; Joseph was stripped of his clothes, and sold for twenty pieces of silver at the motion of Judah, and Christ, by one of the same name, was sold for thirty pieces of silver, and was stripped of his clothes by the Roman soldiers; Joseph was delivered into the hands of foreigners, and Christ into the hands of the Gentiles; Joseph being reckoned as dead by his father, and yet alive, may be herein an emblem of Christ's death, and his resurrection from the dead. <p>(h)  Sept.

When he came to the pit and found Joseph gone, he rent his clothes (a sign of intense grief on the part of the natural man) and exclaimed: "The boy is no more, and I, whither shall I go!" - how shall I account to his father for his disappearance! But the brothers were at no loss; they dipped Joseph's coat in the blood of a goat and sent it to his father, with the message, "We have found this; see whether it is thy son's coat or not." Jacob recognised the coat at once, and mourned bitterly in mourning clothes (&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;) for his son, whom he supposed to have been devoured and destroyed by a wild beast (&#1496;&#1512;&#1507; &#1496;&#1512;&#1507; inf. abs. of Kal before Pual, as an indication of undoubted certainty), and refused all comfort from his children, saying, "No (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; immo, elliptical: Do not attempt to comfort me, for) I will go down mourning into Sheol to my son." Sheol denotes the place where departed souls are gathered after death; it is an infinitive form from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; to demand, the demanding, applied to the place which inexorably summons all men into its shade (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>). How should his sons comfort him, when they were obliged to cover their wickedness with the sin of lying and hypocrisy, and when even Reuben, although at first beside himself at the failure of his plan, had not courage enough to disclose his brothers' crime? </body></html>
