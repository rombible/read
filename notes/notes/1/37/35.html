Jacob supposed that Joseph had been devoured by wild beasts, and as he was not buried, the father could not have “gone down into the grave unto his son.” (Comp.

Joseph, whose supposed premature and violent death he thus deeply and inconsolably lamented, was still alive and in health; and God was preparing him for, and conducting him to, a state of felicity and glory much beyond what Jacob could reasonably have expected or desired for him. Nay, and God by these very means, which had deprived Jacob of him for a time, was pursuing the measures which his infinite wisdom had devised to make Joseph the instrument of preserving Jacob and all his family from perishing by famine! Thus do we often mourn, with the bitterest anguish, those very ways and acts of Providence, which are designed to be productive of the greatest good to us; and consider as the greatest evils those things which God intends to be real and lasting blessings! Let us then learn to resign ourselves and all our affairs to the disposal of that infinitely wise and gracious Being, who is engaged, by promise, to make all things work for good to them that love and trust in him. And let us be aware that great affection to any creature doth but prepare for so much the greater affliction, when it is either removed from us, or imbittered to us: inordinate love commonly ends in immoderate grief.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:31-36 When Satan has taught men to commit one sin, he teaches them to try to conceal it with another; to hide theft and murder, with lying and false oaths: but he that covers his sin shall not prosper long. Joseph's brethren kept their own and one another's counsel for some time; but their villany came to light at last, and it is here published to the world. To grieve their father, they sent him Joseph's coat of colours; and he hastily thought, on seeing the bloody coat, that Joseph was rent in pieces. Let those that know the heart of a parent, suppose the agony of poor Jacob. His sons basely pretended to comfort him, but miserable, hypocritical comforters were they all. Had they really desired to comfort him, they might at once have done it, by telling the truth. The heart is strangely hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Jacob refused to be comforted. Great affection to any creature prepares for so much the greater affliction, when it is taken from us, or made bitter to us: undue love commonly ends in undue grief. It is the wisdom of parents not to bring up children delicately, they know not to what hardships they may be brought before they die. From the whole of this chapter we see with wonder the ways of Providence. The malignant brothers seem to have gotten their ends; the merchants, who care not what they deal in so that they gain, have also obtained theirs; and Potiphar, having got a fine young slave, has obtained his! But God's designs are, by these means, in train for execution. This event shall end in Israel's going down to Egypt; that ends in their deliverance by Moses; that in setting up the true religion in the world; and that in the spread of it among all nations by the gospel. Thus the wrath of man shall praise the Lord, and the remainder thereof will he restrain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The brothers contrive to conceal their crime; and Joseph is sold into Egypt. "Torn, torn in pieces is Joseph." The sight of the bloody coat convinces Jacob at once that Joseph has been devoured by a wild beast. "All his daughters." Only one daughter of Jacob is mentioned by name. These are probably his daughters-in-law. "To the grave." Sheol is the place to which the soul departs at death. It is so called from its ever craving, or being empty. "Minister." This word originally means eunuch, and then, generally, any officer about the court or person of the sovereign. "Captain of the guards." The guards are the executioners of the sentences passed by the sovereign on culprits, which were often arbitrary, summary, and extremely severe. It is manifest, from this dark chapter, that the power of sin has not been extinguished in the family of Jacob. The name of God does not appear, and his hand is at present only dimly seen among the wicked designs, deeds, and devices of these unnatural brothers. Nevertheless, his counsel of mercy standeth sure, and fixed is his purpose to bring salvation to the whole race of man, by means of his special covenant with Abraham. <p> - The Family of Judah<p>1. &#1506;&#1491;&#1500;&#1501;  &#8219;a&#780;du&#770;lla&#770;m, 'Adullam, "righteousness." &#1495;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;  ch&#305;&#770;yra&#770;h Chirah, "nobility?"<p>2. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;  shu&#770;a&#8219;, Shua', "luck, riches, cry."<p>3. &#1506;&#1512;  &#8219;e&#770;r, 'Er, "watching."<p>4. &#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;  'o&#770;na&#770;n, Onan, "strong."<p>5. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;  she&#772;la&#770;h, Shelah, "request? rest." &#1499;&#1494;&#1497;&#1489;  kez&#305;&#770;yb Kezib, "falsehood."<p>6. &#1514;&#1502;&#1512;  ta&#772;ma&#772;r, Tamar, "palm."<p>12. &#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;  t&#305;&#770;mna&#770;h, Timnah, "counted or assigned."<p>14. &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;  'e&#770;ynay&#305;&#770;m, 'Enaim, "two fountains."<p>29. &#1508;&#1512;&#1509;  perets, Perets, "breach."<p>This strange narrative is an episode in the history of Joseph; but an integral part of the "generations" of Jacob. It is loosely dated with the phrase "at that time." This does not indicate a sequel to the preceding record, the proper phrase for which is "after these things" (&#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1495;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;  'achar hadeba&#772;r&#305;&#770;ym ha&#770;'e&#772;leh <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>). It implies rather a train of events that commenced at least in the past, some time before the closing incident of the previous narrative <a href="/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>. But the sale of Joseph, which alone is recorded in the last chapter, only occupied some few weeks or months of a year. Hence, the circumstances contained in this memoir of Judah's family must have taken their rise before that event. The date "at that time," is rendered indefinite also by being attached to the phrase, "And it came to pass," which covers at least all the events in the first eleven verses of the chapter.<p>All this is in accordance with the customary mode of arranging parallel lines of events in Hebrew narrative. We shall see reason afterward for placing the birth of Er at as early a date as possible in the life of Judah <a href="/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>. Now Judah, we conceive, was born when his father was eighty-seven, and Joseph when he was ninety-one, and hence, there is a difference about four years in their ages. We suppose Er to have been born in Judah's fourteenth year, when Joseph and Dinah were in their tenth, and therefore, about three years before the rape of Dinah, and shortly after Jacob arrived at the town of Shekem. The dishonor of Dinah, and the cruel treatment of Joseph, being of essential moment in the process of things, had to be recorded in the main line of events. The commencement of Judah's family, having no particular influence on the current of the history, is fitly reserved until the whole of the circumstances could be brought together into a connected narrative. And the private history of Judah's line is given, while that of the others is omitted, simply because from him the promised seed is descended. As soon as Jacob is settled in the promised land, the contact with Hebron and its neighborhood seems to have commenced. A clear proof of this is the presence of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, in Jacob's family <a href="/genesis/35-8.htm">Genesis 35:8</a>. The great thoroughfare from Damascus to Egypt runs through Shekem and Hebron, and we know that when Jacob was residing at Hebron, his sons fed their flocks at Shekem and Dothan, and the youthful Joseph was sent to inquire after their welfare.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/37.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son&#8212;not the earth, for Joseph was supposed to be torn in pieces, but the unknown place&#8212;the place of departed souls, where Jacob expected at death to meet his beloved son.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All his daughters; </span> Dinah, and his daughters-in-law, and his sons’ daughters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The grave; </span> this Hebrew word <span class="ital">sheol</span> is taken sometimes for hell, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/job/11-8.htm" title="It is as high as heaven; what can you do? deeper than hell; what can you know?">Job 11:8</a> <a href="/proverbs/15-11.htm" title="Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?">Proverbs 15:11</a></span>, but most commonly for the grave, or the place or state of the dead, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/42-38.htm" title="And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which you go, then shall you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.">Genesis 42:38</a> 44:29,31 Psa 6:5 16:10</span>, &c.

His sons must act a most hypocritical part in this affair; and as for his daughters, it is not easy to say who they were, since he had but one daughter that we read of, whose name was Dinah: the Targum of Jonathan calls them his sons wives; but it is a question whether any of his sons were as yet married, since the eldest of them was not more than twenty four years of age; and much less can their daughters be supposed to be meant, as they are by some. It is the opinion of the Jews, that Jacob had a twin daughter born to him with each of his sons; these his sons and daughters came together, or singly, to condole his loss, to sympathize with him, and speak a word of comfort to him, and entreat him not to give way to excessive grief and sorrow: <p>but he refused to be comforted; to attend to anything that might serve to alleviate his mind, and to abstain from outward mourning, and the tokens of it; he chose not to be interrupted in it: <p>and he said, for I will go down into the grave unto my son, mourning; the meaning is, not that he would by any means hasten his own death, or go down to his son in the grave, strictly and literally taken; since, according to his apprehension of his son's death he could have no grave, being torn to pieces by a wild beast; but either that he should go into the state of the dead, where his son was, mourning all along till he carne thither; or rather that he would go mourning all his days "for his son" (e), as some render it, till he came to the grave; nor would he, nor should he receive any comfort more in this world: <p>thus his father wept for him; in this manner, with such circumstances as before related, and he only; for as for his brethren they hated him, and were glad they had got rid of him; or, "and his father", &amp;c.

But the brothers were at no loss; they dipped Joseph's coat in the blood of a goat and sent it to his father, with the message, "We have found this; see whether it is thy son's coat or not." Jacob recognised the coat at once, and mourned bitterly in mourning clothes (&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;) for his son, whom he supposed to have been devoured and destroyed by a wild beast (&#1496;&#1512;&#1507; &#1496;&#1512;&#1507; inf. abs. of Kal before Pual, as an indication of undoubted certainty), and refused all comfort from his children, saying, "No (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; immo, elliptical: Do not attempt to comfort me, for) I will go down mourning into Sheol to my son."
