After the cruel and barbarous massacre which Jacob’s sons had been guilty of toward the Shechemites, it is a wonder they should venture to seek pasture for their flocks in that neighbourhood; but it is no wonder that their father should be anxious for their safety. It must be observed, however, as the LXX. make a difference in the spelling of the name of that place where they had so lately robbed and murdered the people, and this where they were now feeding their flocks, some suppose that this was not the same Shechem, but another at some considerable distance from it. Be this as it will, as either place was at least forty, if not sixty miles from Hebron, if Jacob had any idea of the envy and malice which actuated his other sons against Joseph, it is not to be supposed that he would have sent him among them, and have thus put his life in their hands. The providence of God, however, was in the whole affair, for his own glory, and the preservation of the lives of many.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:12-22 How readily does Joseph wait his father's orders! Those children who are best beloved by their parents, should be the most ready to obey them. See how deliberate Joseph's brethren were against him. They thought to slay him from malice aforethought, and in cold blood. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, 1Jo 3:15. The sons of Jacob hated their brother because their father loved him. New occasions, as his dreams and the like, drew them on further; but this laid rankling in their hearts, till they resolved on his death. God has all hearts in his hands. Reuben had most reason to be jealous of Joseph, for he was the first-born; yet he proves his best friend. God overruled all to serve his own purpose, of making Joseph an instrument to save much people alive. Joseph was a type of Christ; for though he was the beloved Son of his Father, and hated by a wicked world, yet the Father sent him out of his bosom to visit us in great humility and love. He came from heaven to earth to seek and save us; yet then malicious plots were laid against him. His own not only received him not, but crucified him. This he submitted to, as a part of his design to redeem and save us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph is sent to Dothan.

But the herbage there was so rich and nutritious that they thought it well worth the pains of so long a journey, to the neglect of the grazing district of Hebron [Van De Velde].<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the parts adjoining to <span class="ital">Shechem, </span> in the lands which he had purchased there, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a></span>.

But those pastures being his own, and convenient for his use, he did commit himself and them to that same good Providence which watched over him then and ever since, and still kept up that terror which then he sent upon them.

Very probably some considerable time after the telling of the above dreams; it was usual to remove flocks from place to place for the sake of pasturage; and sometimes at a great distance, as Shechem was from Hebron, where Jacob now dwelt, said (i) to be about sixty miles; but this is not so much to be marvelled at as the place itself, whither they went, for though Jacob had bought a parcel of a field in this place, <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; which might be a reason for their going thither to feed their father's flocks in his own field; yet it was the place where they had committed a most outrageous action in destroying all, the males there, and therefore might fear the inhabitants of the neighbouring cities would rise upon them and cut them off. <p>(i) Bunting's Travels, p. 79.

The fact that Jacob’s brethren selected it for pasturing their flocks, indicates that the Dinah narrative, recorded in chap. 34, belongs to a separate group of Israelite tradition. Clearly Dinah, if we may judge from <a href="/context/genesis/30-21.htm" title="And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah....">Genesis 30:21-24</a>, was of the same age as Joseph. Joseph in the present chapter (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/37-2.htm" title="These are the generations of Jacob.

Evidently the present J narrative is independent of them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Seeing that Jacob, according to <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/37-14.htm" title="And he said to him, Go, I pray you, see whether it be well with your brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.">Genesis 37:14</a></span>, was residing in Hebron, Shechem and Dothan would be a very great distance away from the patriarch’s residence. Apparently the writer assumes that the whole country was open grazing ground.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the modern Nablous, in the plain of Muknah, which belonged to Jacob partly by purchase and partly by conquest (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 33:19; 34:27). Shechem was at a considerable distance from the vale of Hebron, where the patriarchal family at this time resided. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/37.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This hatred was increased when Joseph told them of two dreams that he had had: viz., that as they were binding sheaves in the field, his sheaf "stood and remained standing," but their sheaves placed themselves round it and bowed down to it; and that the sun (his father), and the moon (his mother, "not Leah, but Rachel, who was neither forgotten nor lost"), and eleven stars (his eleven brethren) bowed down before him. These dreams pointed in an unmistakeable way to the supremacy of Joseph; the first to supremacy over his brethren, the second over the whole house of Israel. The repetition seemed to establish the thing as certain (cf. <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>); so that not only did his brethren hate him still more "on account of his dreams and words" (<a href="/genesis/37-8.htm">Genesis 37:8</a>), i.e., the substance of the dreams and the open interpretation of them, and become jealous and envious, but his father gave him a sharp reproof for the second, though he preserved the matter, i.e., retained it in his memory (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; lxx &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;, cf. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, <a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>). The brothers with their ill-will could not see anything in the creams but the suggestions of his own ambition and pride of heart; and even the father, notwithstanding his partiality, was grieved by the second dream. The dreams are not represented as divine revelations; yet they are not to be regarded as pure flights of fancy from an ambitious heart, but as the presentiments of deep inward feelings, which were not produced without some divine influence being exerted upon Joseph's mind, and therefore were of prophetic significance, though they were not inspired directly by God, inasmuch as the purposes of God were still to remain hidden from the eyes of men for the saving good of all concerned. </body></html>
