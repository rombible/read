God has more ways than one to sadden the spirits. Joseph had compassion towards them. Let us be concerned for the sadness of our brethren's countenances. It is often a relief to those that are in trouble to be noticed. Also learn to look into the causes of our own sorrow. Is there a good reason? Is there not comfort sufficient to balance it, whatever it is? Why art thou cast down, O my soul? Joseph was careful to ascribe the glory to God. The chief butler's dream foretold his advancement. The chief baker's dream his death. It was not Joseph's fault that he brought the baker no better tidings. And thus ministers are but interpreters; they cannot make the thing otherwise than it is: if they deal faithfully, and their message prove unpleasing, it is not their fault. Joseph does not reflect upon his brethren that sold him; nor does he reflect on the wrong done him by his mistress and his master, but mildly states his own innocence. When we are called on to clear ourselves, we should carefully avoid, as much as may be, speaking ill of others. Let us be content to prove ourselves innocent, and not upbraid others with their guilt.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/40.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chief butler now recites his dream. "Pressed them into Pharaoh's cup." The imagery of the dream is not intended to intimate that Pharaoh drank only the fresh juice of the grape. It only expresses by a natural figure the source of wine, and possibly the duty of the chief butler to understand and superintend the whole process of its formation. Egypt was not only a corn, but a vine country. The interpretation of this dream was very obvious and natural; yet not without a divine intimation could it be known that the "three branches were three days." Joseph, in the quiet confidence that his interpretation would prove correct, begs the chief butler to remember him and endeavor to procure his release. "Stolen, stolen was I." He assures him that he was not a criminal, and that his enslavement was an act of wrongful violence - a robbery by the strong hand. "From the land of the Hebrews;" a very remarkable expression, as it strongly favors the presumption that the Hebrews inhabited the country before Kenaan took possession of it. "I have not done aught." Joseph pleads innocence, and claims liberation, not as an unmerited favor, but as a right. "The pit." The pit without water seems to have been the primitive place of confinement for culprits.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/40.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15. Joseph said, &#8230; This is the interpretation&#8212;Speaking as an inspired interpreter, he told the butler that within three days he would be restored to all the honors and privileges of his office; and while making that joyful announcement, he earnestly bespoke the officer's influence for his own liberation. Nothing has hitherto met us in the record indicative of Joseph's feelings; but this earnest appeal reveals a sadness and impatient longing for release, which not all his piety and faith in God could dispel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/40.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Signify <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">three days.</span> So that word is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/40-18.htm" title="And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:">Genesis 40:18</a> 41:26,27 Da 2:38 4:22 <a href="/matthew/13-19.htm" title="When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart.

an expression which Joseph never could have used, since the Hebrews were strangers and sojourners in the land, and had no settled possession in it, and therefore a certain index of the lateness of the composition of this portion of the narrative (Block, 'Introd.,' &sect; 80); but if Abram, nearly two centuries earlier, was recognized as a Hebrew (<a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>), and if Potiphar's wife could, in speaking to her Egyptian husband and domestics, describe Joseph as an Hebrew (<a href="/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14, 17</a>), there does not appear sufficient reason why Joseph should not be able to characterize his country as the land of the Hebrews. The Hebrews had through Abraham become known at least to Pharaoh and his Court as belonging to the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-15.htm">Genesis 12:15-20</a>); and it is not a violent supposition that in Joseph s time "<span class="accented">the</span> land of the Hebrews" was a phrase quite intelligible to an Egyptian, as signifying not perhaps the entire extent of Palestine, but the region round about Hebron and Mamre (Nachmanides, Clericus, Rosenm&uuml;ller) - scarcely as suggesting that the Hebrews had possession of the land prior to the Canaanites (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">And here also have I done nothing</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> committed no crime) <span class="cmt_word">that they should</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that they have</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>put me into the dungeon</span>.

On account of these dreams, which seemed to them to have some bearing upon their fate, and, as the issue proved, were really true omens of it, Joseph found them the next morning looking anxious, and asked them the reason of the trouble which was depicted upon their countenances. </body></html>
