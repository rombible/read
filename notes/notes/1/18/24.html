Abraham prayed earnestly that Sodom might be spared, if but a few righteous persons should be found in it. Come and learn from Abraham what compassion we should feel for sinners, and how earnestly we should pray for them. We see here that the effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. Abraham, indeed, failed in his request for the whole place, but Lot was miraculously delivered. Be encouraged then to expect, by earnest prayer, the blessing of God upon your families, your friends, your neighbourhood. To this end you must not only pray, but you must live like Abraham. He knew the Judge of all the earth would do right. He does not plead that the wicked may be spared for their own sake, or because it would be severe to destroy them, but for the sake of the righteous who might be found among them. And righteousness only can be made a plea before God. How then did Christ make intercession for transgressors? Not by blaming the Divine law, nor by alleging aught in extenuation or excuse of human guilt; but by pleading HIS OWN obedience unto death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham intercedes for Sodom. His spiritual character is unfolded and exalted more and more. He employs the language of a free-born son with his heavenly Father. He puts forward the plea of justice to the righteous in behalf of the city. He ventures to repeat his intervention six times, every time diminishing the number of the righteous whom he supposes to be in it. The patience of the Lord is no less remarkable than the perseverance of Abraham. In every case he grants his petition. "Dust and ashes." This may refer to the custom of burning the dead, as then coexistent with that of burying them. Abraham intimates by a homely figure the comparative insignificance of the petitioner. He is dust at first, and ashes at last.<p>This completes the full and free conversation of God with Abraham. He accepts his hospitable entertainment, renews his promise of a son by Sarah, communicates to him his counsel, and grants all his requests. It is evident that Abraham has now fully entered upon all the privileges of the sons of God. He has become the friend of God <a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>. <p> - The Destruction of Sodom and Amorah<p>9. &#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&lt;&#1492;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;  gesh-ha&#772;l'a&#770;h, "approach to a distant point," stand back.<p>11. &#1505;&#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;  saneve&#772;r&#305;&#770;ym, "blindness," affecting the mental more than the ocular vision.<p>37. &#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489;  mo&#770;'a&#772;b, Moab; &#1502;&#1488;&#1489;  me&#772;'a&#772;b, "from a father." &#1489;&#1503;&#1470;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;  ben-&#8219;am&#305;&#770;y, Ben-'ammi, "son of my people." &#1506;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;  &#8219;amo&#770;n, 'Ammon, "of the people."<p>This chapter is the continuation and conclusion of the former. It records a part of God's strange work - strange, because it consists in punishment, and because it is foreign to the covenant of grace. Yet it is closely connected with Abraham's history, inasmuch as it is a signal chastisement of wickedness in his neighborhood, a memorial of the righteous judgment of God to all his posterity, and at the same time a remarkable answer to the spirit, if not to the letter, of his intercessory prayer. His kinsman Lot, the only righteous man in Sodom, with his wife and two daughters, is delivered from destruction in accordance with his earnest appeal on behalf of the righteous.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 18:23-33.

Abraham drew near, and said, &c.&#8212;The scene described is full of interest and instruction&#8212;showing in an unmistakable manner the efficacy of prayer and intercession. (See also Pr 15:8; Jas 5:16). Abraham reasoned justly as to the rectitude of the divine procedure (Ro 3:5, 6), and many guilty cities and nations have been spared on account of God's people (Mt 5:13; 24:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Within the city, </span> i.e. in the cities concerned, as appears by <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;">Genesis 18:20</a></span>, and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm" title="And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.">Genesis 19:25</a></span>; the singular number for the plural, as is frequent, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/3-22.htm" title="And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:">Genesis 3:22</a> <a href="/1_chronicles/10-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.">1 Chronicles 10:1</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/1_samuel/31-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.">1 Samuel 31:1</a></span>, and oft elsewhere.

Abraham accompanied them some distance on the road; according to tradition, he went as far as the site of the later Caphar barucha, from which you can see the Dead Sea through a ravine, - solitudinem ac terras Sodomae. And Jehovah said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I propose to do? Abraham is destined to be a great nation and a blessing to all nations (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>); for I have known, i.e., acknowledged him (chosen him in anticipative love, &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; as in <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>), that he may command his whole posterity to keep the way of Jehovah, to practise justice and righteousness, that all the promises may be fulfilled in them." God then disclosed to Abraham what he was about to do to Sodom and Gomorrah, not, as Kurtz supposes, because Abraham had been constituted the hereditary possessor of the land, and Jehovah, being mindful of His covenant, would not do anything to it without his knowledge and assent (a thought quite foreign to the context), but because Jehovah had chosen him to be the father of the people of God, in order that, by instructing his descendants in the fear of God, he might lead them in the paths of righteousness, so that they might become partakers of the promised salvation, and not be overtaken by judgment. The destruction of Sodom and the surrounding cities was to be a permanent memorial of the punitive righteousness of God, and to keep the fate of the ungodly constantly before the mind of Israel. To this end Jehovah explained to Abraham the cause of their destruction in the clearest manner possible, that he might not only be convinced of the justice of the divine government, but might learn that when the measure of iniquity was full, no intercession could avert the judgment-a lesson and a warning to his descendants also. </body></html>
