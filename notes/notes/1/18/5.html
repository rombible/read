While Abraham was thus sitting, he saw three men coming. These were three heavenly beings in human bodies. Some think they were all created angels; others, that one of them was the Son of God, the Angel of the covenant. Washing the feet is customary in those hot climates, where only sandals are worn. We should not be forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares, Heb 13:2; nay, the Lord of angels himself; as we always do, when for his sake we entertain the least of his brethren. Cheerful and obliging manners in showing kindness, are great ornaments to piety. Though our condescending Lord vouchsafes not personal visits to us, yet still by his Spirit he stands at the door and knocks; when we are inclined to open, he deigns to enter; and by his gracious consolations he provides a rich feast, of which we partake with him, Re 3:20.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord. - Abraham uses the word &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  'adona&#772;y denoting one having authority, whether divine or not. This the Masorites mark as sacred, and apply the vowel points proper to the word when it signifies God. These men in some way represent God; for "the Lord" on this occasion appeared unto Abraham <a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>. The number is in this respect notable. Abraham addresses himself first to one person <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>, then to more than one <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4-5</a>. It is stated that "'they' said, So do <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>, 'they' did eat <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>, ' they' said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife" <a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9</a>. Then the singular number is resumed in the phrase "'and he said'" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>, and at length, "The Lord said unto Abraham" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-13.htm">Genesis 18:13</a>, and then, "and he said" <a href="/genesis/18-15.htm">Genesis 18:15</a>. Then we are told "'the men' rose up, and Abraham went with them" <a href="/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>. Then we have "The Lord said" twice <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>, <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20</a>. And lastly, it is said <a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22</a> "'the men' turned their faces and went toward Sodom, and Abraham was yet standing before the Lord." From this it appears that of the three men one, at all events, was the Lord, who, when the other two went toward Sodom, remained with Abraham while he made his intercession for Sodom, and afterward he also went his way. The other two will come before us again in the next chapter. Meanwhile, we have here the first explicit instance of the Lord appearing as man to man, and holding familiar conversation with him.<p>The narrative affords a pleasing instance of the primitive manners of the East. The hospitality of the pastoral tribes was spontaneous and unreserved. The washing of the feet, which were partly at least uncovered in walking, the reclining under the tree, and the offer of refreshment, are indicative of an unchanging rural simplicity. The phrases "a little water, a morsel of bread," flow from a thoughtful courtesy. "Therefore are ye come." In the course of events it has so fallen out, in order that you might be refreshed. The brief reply is a frank and unaffected acceptance of the hospitable invitation.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. for therefore are ye come&#8212;No questions were asked.
