The one who is called Jehovah throughout the chapter, continued with Abraham, and would not hide from him the thing he intended to do. Though God long forbears with sinners, from which they fancy that the Lord does not see, and does not regard; yet when the day of his wrath comes, he will look toward them. The Lord will give Abraham an opportunity to intercede with him, and shows him the reason of his conduct. Consider, as a very bright part of Abraham's character and example, that he not only prayed with his family, but he was very careful to teach and rule them well. Those who expect family blessings must make conscience of family duty. Abraham did not fill their heads with matters of doubtful dispute; but he taught them to be serious and devout in the worship of God, and to be honest in their dealings with all men. Of how few may such a character be given in our days! How little care is taken by masters of families to ground those under them in the principles of religion!

The Targum of Jonathan adds, to the ministering angels, the two angels that were with him in the likeness of men; or to Abraham, at least in his hearing, by which he understood that Sodom and other cities were about to be destroyed for their sins: <p>because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great; either of Lot in it, whose righteous soul was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked, and cried to heaven against them; or of the inhabitants that were oppressed by others, either in their bodies, being forced to submit to their unnatural usage of them, or in their estates, of which they wronged them; particularly the cry of the poor among them, whom they suffered to starve, though there were fulness of bread in the midst of them, see <a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>; the Jews (b) say, they appointed false judges, who oppressed all strangers that came to Sodom, and made a law, that whoever relieved a poor person should be burnt with fire: or the cry of their sins, which were many and great, and openly and impudently committed; the cry of which came into the ears of the Lord of hosts, and called for vengeance. Those two cities, which perhaps were the greatest and the most remarkable for their sins, are put for all the five cities of the plain, called Pentapolis. <p>And because their sin is very grievous; attended with very aggravated circumstances, they enjoyed great plenty of good things; and were not to be bore with, being so exceeding sinful, and so publicly and audaciously committed, especially that sin so frequent among them, which has its name from Sodom, see <a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>. <p>(b) Pirke Eliezer, c. 25. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">Because … because</span>] Better, as marg., <span class="ital">Verily … verily</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah</span>] See <a href="/genesis/19-13.htm" title="For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.">Genesis 19:13</a>. (1) Either, this is the complaint concerning Sodom and Gomorrah going up to Heaven.

(2) Or, it is the cry by the cities, which are personified, and which make their loud complaint against the inhabitants. The genitive then is subjective.

On being told that she was in the tent, where she could hear, therefore, all that passed under the tree in front of the tent, the one whom Abraham addressed as Adonai (my Lord), and who is called Jehovah in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-13.htm">Genesis 18:13</a>, said, "I will return to thee (&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;) at this time, when it lives again" (&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, reviviscens, without the article, Ges. 111, 2b), i.e., at this time next year; "and, behold, Sarah, thy wife, will (then) have a son." Sarah heard this at the door of the tent; "and it was behind Him" (Jehovah), so that she could not be seen by Him as she stood at the door. But as the fulfilment of this promise seemed impossible to her, on account of Abraham's extreme age, and the fact that her own womb had lost the power of conception, she laughed within herself, thinking that she was not observed. But that she might know that the promise was made by the omniscient and omnipotent God, He reproved her for laughing, saying, "Is anything too wonderful (i.e., impossible) for Jehovah? at the time appointed I will return unto thee," etc.; and when her perplexity led her to deny it, He convicted her of falsehood. Abraham also had laughed at this promise (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>), and without receiving any reproof. For his laughing was the joyous outburst of astonishment; Sarah's, on the contrary, the result of doubt and unbelief, which had to be broken down by reproof, and, as the result showed, really was broken down, inasmuch as she conceived and bore a son, whom she could only have conceived in faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>). </body></html>
