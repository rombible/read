Even the children of Eber had become worshippers of false gods. Those who are through grace, heirs of the land of promise, ought to remember what was the land of their birth; what was their corrupt and sinful state by nature. Abram's brethren were, Nahor, out of whose family both Isaac and Jacob had their wives; and Haran, the father of Lot, who died before his father. Children cannot be sure that they shall outlive their parents. Haran died in Ur, before the happy removal of the family out of that idolatrous country. It concerns us to hasten out of our natural state, lest death surprise us in it. We here read of Abram's departure out of Ur of the Chaldees, with his father Terah, his nephew Lot, and the rest of his family, in obedience to the call of God. This chapter leaves them about mid-way between Ur and Canaan, where they dwelt till Terah's death. Many reach to Charran, and yet fall short of Canaan; they are not far from the kingdom of God, and yet never come thither.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But Sarai was barren. - From this statement it is evident that Abram had been married for some time before the migration took place. It is also probable that Milkah had begun to have a family; a circumstance which would render the barrenness of Sarai the more remarkable.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. Ur&#8212;now Orfa; that is, "light," or "fire." Its name probably derived from its being devoted to the rites of fire-worship.
