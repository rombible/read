In light of this, note God’s priority here. He employed 20 percent of the book (1-11) to describe the first 1,800 years. This covers Creation, the Fall, the flood, and Babel. He employed 80 percent of the book (12-50) to describe the final 400 years. Here we read of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. This means approximately 80 percent of the total time period is covered in only 11 chapters, while 20 percent of the time is described in 39 chapters. The priority point is simple—in the mind of God, Abraham is more important than the universe.<p class="num"><span class="nm">2.</span> It is the only book which describes God as resting (2:2, 3).<p class="num"><span class="nm">3.</span> It gives the first prophecy of the coming Messiah, of his suffering and eventual victory (3:15).<p class="num"><span class="nm">4.</span> It provides his first two names (Seed of the woman and Shiloh) (3:15; 49:10).<p class="num"><span class="nm">5.</span> It pin points the tribe from whence he would come (Judah) and is the first book to mention the city where he would be born (Bethlehem) .
