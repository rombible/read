It is a spur to exertion to see others supplied. Shall others get food for their souls, and shall we starve while it is to be had? Having discovered where help is to be had, we should apply for it without delay, without shrinking from labour, or grudging expense, especially as regards our never-dying souls. There is provision in Christ; but we must come to him, and seek it from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/42.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The aged Jacob is the only man of counsel.

The ten brothers are sent, and Benjamin, the youngest, is retained, not merely because of his youth, for he was now twenty-four years of age, but because he was the son of his father's old age, the only son of Rachel now with him, and the only full brother of the lost Joseph.

That he entrusted his sons, and not his servants, with the mission, though perhaps dictated by a sense of its importance (Lawson), was clearly of Divine arrangement for the further accomplishment of the Divine plan concerning Joseph and his brethren. <span class="cmt_word">And buy</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> buy corn, the verb being a denominative from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, corn) <span class="cmt_word">for us from thence</span>. From this it is apparent that the hitherto abundant flocks and herds of the patriarchal family had been greatly reduced by the long-continued and severe drought, thus requiring them to obtain food from Egypt, if either any portion of their flocks were to be saved, or themselves to escape starvation, as the patriarch explained to his sons. <span class="cmt_word">That we may</span> (literally, and we <span class="accented">shall</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>live, and not die.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the years of scarcity commenced, at the close of the years of plenty, the famine spread over all (the neighbouring) lands; only in Egypt was there bread. As the famine increased in the land, and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, he directed them to Joseph, who "opened all in which was" (bread), i.e., all the granaries, and sold corn (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, denom. from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, signifies to trade in corn, to buy and sell corn) to the Egyptians, and (as the writer adds, with a view to what follows) to all the world (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, <a href="/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>), that came thither to buy corn, because the famine was great on every hand. - Years of famine have frequently fallen, like this one, upon Egypt, and the neighbouring countries to the north. The cause of this is to be seen in the fact, that the overflowing of the Nile, to which Egypt is indebted for its fertility, is produced by torrents of rain falling in the alpine regions of Abyssinia, which proceed from clouds formed in the Mediterranean and carried thither by the wind; consequently it has a common origin with the rains of Palestine (see the proofs in Hengst. pp. 37ff.). </body></html>
