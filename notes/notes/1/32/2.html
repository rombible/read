Jacob sent a message, showing that he did not insist upon the birth-right. Yielding pacifies great offences, Ec 10:4. We must not refuse to speak respectfully, even to those unjustly angry with us.

This passage, recording Laban's farewell and departure, closes the connection of Jacob with Haran and all its toils of servitude, and is hence, annexed to the previous chapter in the English version. In the distribution of the original text, it is regarded as the counterpart of the two following verses, in which Jacob's onward progress is mentioned, and so placed with them at the beginning of a new chapter. "The angels of God met him." Twenty years ago Jacob saw the mystical ladder connecting heaven and earth, and the angels of God thereupon ascending and descending from the one to the other. Now, in circumstances of danger, he sees the angels of God on earth, encamped beside or around his own camp <a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>. He recognizes them as God's camp, and names the place Mahanaim, from the double encampment. This vision is not dwelt upon, as it is the mere sequel of the former scene at Bethel.

The Jewish writers (t) say, the host of God is 60,000, and that the Shechinah, or divine Majesty, never dwells among less, and that Mahanaim, or two hosts, are 120,000; there was afterwards a city of this name near this place, which very likely was so called in memory of this appearance, <a href="/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>; and there seems to be an allusion to it in the account of the church, Sol 6:13; it was in the land of Gilead, and tribe of Gad, forty four miles from Jerusalem to the southeast (u). <p>(t) In Bereshit Rabba, sect. 75. fol. 66. 1.((u) Bunting's Travels, p. 74. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when Jacob saw them, he said, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> This <i>is</i> God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span><p>(a) He acknowledges God's benefits: who for the preservation of his, sends hosts of angels.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">This is God’s host</span>] The Heb. word for “host” (<span class="ital">maḥaneh</span>) is usually, and ought here to be, rendered “camp.” The angels are regarded as the warriors of Jehovah; cf. the narrative in <a href="/context/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?...">Joshua 5:13-15</a>, and <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm" title="Bless you the LORD, all you his hosts; you ministers of his, that do his pleasure.">Psalm 103:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-2.htm" title="Praise you him, all his angels: praise you him, all his hosts.">Psalm 148:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Mahanaim</span>] That is, <span class="ital">Two hosts</span>, or, <span class="ital">companies</span>.

Mahanaim, afterwards a distinguished city in the territory of Gad (<a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), and frequently referred to in subsequent Scripture (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>; 27; 19:32; <a href="/1_kings/4-14.htm">1 Kings 4:14</a>), as well as mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 7.9, 8), as a strong and beautiful city, has been identified with Mahneh, a deserted ruin six or seven miles north-west by north of Ajlun (Mount Gilead), and about twenty miles from the Jabbok (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Robinson,' vol. 3. App. 166; and cf. Tristram, 'The Land of Israel, p. 483); but the narrative appears to say that Mahanaim lay not north of Ga-leed, but between that place and Jabbok. Hence Porter suggests Gerasa, the most splendid ruin east of the Jordan, and bordering on the Jabbok, as occupying the site of Mahanaim (<span class="accented">vide</span> Kitto s 'Cyclopedia,' art. Mahanaim, and cf. 'Handbook for S. and P.' 2. 311, seq.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These words of Jacob "cut Laban to the heart with their truth, so that he turned round, offered his hand, and proposed a covenant." Jacob proceeded at once to give a practical proof of his assent to this proposal of his father-in-law, by erecting a stone as a memorial, and calling upon his relations also ("his brethren," as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-23.htm">Genesis 31:23</a>, by whom Laban and the relations who came with him are intended, as <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a> shows) to gather stones into a heap, which formed a table, as is briefly observed in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-46.htm">Genesis 31:46</a>, for the covenant meal (<a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>). This stone-heap was called Jegar-Sahadutha by Laban, and Galeed by Jacob (the former is the Chaldee, the latter the Hebrew; they have both the same meaning, viz., "heaps of witness"),<p>(Note: These words are the oldest proof, that in the native country of the patriarchs, Mesopotamia, Aramaean or Chaldaean was spoken, and Hebrew in Jacob's native country, Canaan; from which we may conclude that Abraham's family first acquired the Hebrew in Canaan from the Canaanites (Phoenicians).)<p>because, as Laban, who spoke first, as being the elder, explained, the heap was to be a "witness between him and Jacob." The historian then adds this explanation: "therefore they called his name Gal'ed," and immediately afterwards introduces a second name, which the heap received from words that were spoken by Laban at the conclusion of the covenant (<a href="/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>): "And Mizpah," i.e., watch, watch-place (sc., he called it), "for he (Laban) said, Jehovah watch between me and thee; for we are hidden from one another (from the face of one another), if thou shalt oppress my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives to my daughters! No man is with us, behold God is witness between me and thee!" (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>, <a href="/genesis/31-50.htm">Genesis 31:50</a>). After these words of Laban, which are introduced parenthetically,<p>(Note: There can be no doubt that <a href="/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a> and <a href="/genesis/31-50.htm">Genesis 31:50</a> bear the marks of a subsequent insertion. But there is nothing in the nature of this interpolation to indicate a compilation of the history from different sources. That Laban, when making this covenant, should have spoken of the future treatment of his daughters, is a thing so natural, that there would have been something strange in the omission. And it is not less suitable to the circumstances, that he calls upon the God of Jacob, i.e., Jehovah, to watch in this affair. And apart from the use of the name Jehovah, which is perfectly suitable here, there is nothing whatever to point to a different source; to say nothing of the fact that the critics themselves cannot agree as to the nature of the source supposed.)<p>and in which he enjoined upon Jacob fidelity to his daughters, the formation of the covenant of reconciliation and peace between them is first described, according to which, neither of them (sive ego sive tu, as in <a href="/exodus/19-13.htm">Exodus 19:13</a>) was to pass the stone-heap and memorial-stone with a hostile intention towards the other. Of this the memorial was to serve as a witness, and the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father (Terah), would be umpire between them. To this covenant, in which Laban, according to his polytheistic views, placed the God of Abraham upon the same level with the God of Nahor and Terah, Jacob swore by "the Fear of Isaac" (<a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>), the God who was worshipped by his father with sacred awe. He then offered sacrifices upon the mountain, and invited his relations to eat, i.e., to partake of a sacrificial meal, and seal the covenant by a feast of love.<p>The geographical names Gilead and Ramath-mizpeh (<a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), also Mizpeh-Gilead (<a href="/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>), sound so obviously like Gal'ed and Mizpah, that they are no doubt connected, and owe their origin to the monument erected by Jacob and Laban; so that it was by prolepsis that the scene of this occurrence was called "the mountains of Gilead" in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-21.htm">Genesis 31:21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/31-23.htm">Genesis 31:23</a>, <a href="/genesis/31-25.htm">Genesis 31:25</a>. By the mount or mountains of Gilead we are not to understand the mountain range to the south of the Jabbok (Zerka), the present Jebel Jelaad, or Jebel es Salt. The name Gilead has a much more comprehensive signification in the Old Testament; and the mountains to the south of the Jabbok are called in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a> the half of Mount Gilead; the mountains to the north of the Jabbok, the Jebel-Ajlun, forming the other half. In this chapter the name is used in the broader sense, and refers primarily to the northern half of the mountains (above the Jabbok); for Jacob did not cross the Jabbok till afterwards (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-23.htm">Genesis 32:23-24</a>). There is nothing in the names Ramath-mizpeh, which Ramoth in Gilead bears in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>, and Mizpeh-Gilead, which it bears in <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>, to compel us to place Laban's meeting with Jacob in the southern portion of the mountains of Gilead. For even if this city is to be found in the modern Salt, and was called Ramath-mizpeh from the even recorded here, all that can be inferred from that is, that the tradition of Laban's covenant with Jacob was associated in later ages with Ramoth in Gilead, without the correctness of the association being thereby established. </body></html>
