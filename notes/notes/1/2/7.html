So in <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm" title="And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.">Genesis 2:19</a> Jehovah forms the animals, and in <a href="/genesis/2-8.htm" title="And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.">Genesis 2:8</a> He plants a garden. As Elohim is almighty power, so Jehovah is wisdom and skill, and His works are full of contrivance and design. As regards man’s body, Jehovah forms it <span class= "ital">dust from the ground: </span>the <span class= "ital">adâmâh, </span>or fruitful arable soil, so called from Adam, for whose use it was specially fitted, and by whom it was first tilled. But the main intention of the words is to point out man’s feebleness. He is made not from the rocks, nor from ores of metal, but from the light, shifting particles of the surface, blown about by every wind. Yet, frail as is man’s body, God—<p><span class= "bld">. . . breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span>—The life came not as the result of man’s bodily organisation, nor as derived by evolution from any other animal, but as a gift direct from God.<p><span class= "bld">And man became a living soul.</span>—The word translated “soul” contains no idea of a spiritual existence. For in <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm" title="And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.">Genesis 1:20</a>, “creature that hath life,” and in <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>, “the living creature,” are literally, <span class= "ital">living soul. </span>Really the word refers to the natural life of animals and men, maintained by breathing, or in some way extracting oxygen from the atmospheric air. And whatever superiority over other animals may be possessed by man comes from the manner in which this living breath was bestowed upon him, and not from his being “a living soul;” for that is common to all alike.<p>The whole of this second narrative is pre-eminently anthropomorphic. In the previous history Elohim commands, and it is done. Here He forms, and builds, and plants, and breathes into His work, and is the companion and friend of the creature He has made. It thus sets before us the love and tenderness of Jehovah, who provides for man a home, fashions for him a wife to be his partner and helpmate, rejoices in his intellect, and brings the lower world to him to see what he will call them, and even after the fall provides the poor outcasts with clothing. It is a picture fitted for the infancy of mankind, and speaking the language of primæval simplicity. But its lesson is for all times. For it proclaims the love of God to man, his special pre-eminence in the scale of being, and that Elohim, the Almighty Creator, is Jehovah-Elohim, the friend and counsellor of the creature whom He has endowed with reason and free-will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord God formed man — </span>Man being the chief of God’s works in this lower world, and being intended to be the lord of all other creatures, we have here a more full account of his creation. The word <span class="greekheb">ייצר</span>, <span class="ital">jitzer, </span>here rendered <span class="ital">he formed, </span>is not used concerning any other creature, and implies a gradual process in the work, with great accuracy and exactness. It is properly used of potters forming vessels on the wheel; and Rabbi D. Kimchi says, that, when used concerning the creation of man, it signifies the formation of his members. <span class="ital">Of the dust of the ground — </span>The Hebrew is, he <span class="ital">formed man dust from the ground. </span>We should remember that, however curiously our bodies, with their various members and senses, are wrought, we are but <span class="ital">dust </span>taken from the ground. <span class="ital">He breathed into his nostrils — </span>And thereby into his head and whole man; <span class="ital">the breath of life — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">the soul of lives, </span>that is, both natural and spiritual, both temporal and eternal life. It is sufficiently implied here that the soul of man is of a quite different nature and higher origin than the souls of beasts, which, together with their bodies, are said to be brought forth by the earth and waters, <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:4-7 Here is a name given to the Creator, Jehovah. Where the word LORD is printed in capital letters in our English Bibles, in the original it is Jehovah. Jehovah is that name of God, which denotes that he alone has his being of himself, and that he gives being to all creatures and things. Further notice is taken of plants and herbs, because they were made and appointed to be food for man. The earth did not bring forth its fruits of itself: this was done by Almighty power. Thus grace in the soul grows not of itself in nature's soil, but is the work of God. Rain also is the gift of God; it came not till the Lord God caused it. Though God works by means, yet when he pleases he can do his own work without them; and though we must not tempt God in the neglect of means, we must trust God, both in the use and in the want of means. Some way or other, God will water the plants of his own planting. Divine grace comes down like the dew, and waters the church without noise. Man was made of the small dust, such as is on the surface of the earth. The soul was not made of the earth, as the body: pity then that it should cleave to the earth, and mind earthly things. To God we must shortly give an account, how we have employed these souls; and if it be found that we have lost them, though it were to gain the world, we are undone for ever! Fools despise their own souls, by caring for their bodies before their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The second obstacle to the favorable progress of the vegetable kingdom is now removed. "And the Lord God formed the man of dust from the soil." This account of the origin of man differs from the former on account of the different end the author has in view. There his creation as an integral whole is recorded with special reference to his higher nature by which he was suited to hold communion with his Maker, and exercise dominion over the inferior creation. Here his constitution is described with marked regard to his adaptation to be the cultivator of the soil. He is a compound of matter and mind. His material part is dust from the soil, out of which he is formed as the potter moulds the vessel out of the clay. He is &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; 'a&#772;da&#772;m "Adam," the man of the soil, &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492;  'a&#774;da&#772;ma&#770;h "adamah." His mission in this respect is to draw out the capabilities of the soil to support by its produce the myriads of his race.<p>His mental part is from another source. "And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." The word &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; nesha&#772;ma&#770;h is invariably applied to God or man, never to any irrational creature. The "breath of life" is special to this passage. It expresses the spiritual and principal element in man, which is not formed, but breathed by the Creator into the physical form of man. This rational part is that in which he bears the image of God, and is suited to be his vicegerent on earth. As the earth was prepared to be the dwelling, so was the body to be the organ of that breath of life which is his essence, himself.<p>And the man became a living soul. - This term "living soul" is also applied to the water and land animals <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-21</a>, <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>. As by his body he is allied to earth and by his soul to heaven, so by the vital union of these he is associated with the whole animal kingdom, of which he is the constituted sovereign. This passage, therefore, aptly describes him as he is suited to dwell and rule on this earth. The height of his glory is yet to come out in his relation to the future and to God.<p>The line of narrative here reaches a point of repose. The second lack of the teeming soil is here supplied. The man to till the ground is presented in that form which exhibits his fitness for this appropriate and needful task. We are therefore at liberty to go back for another train of events which is essential to the progress of our narrative. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

Science has proved that the substance of his flesh, sinews, and bones, consists of the very same elements as the soil which forms the crust of the earth and the limestone that lies embedded in its bowels. But from that mean material what an admirable structure has been reared in the human body (Ps 139:14).<p>the breath of life&#8212;literally, of lives, not only animal but spiritual life.

And this was produced not with his body, as the souls of brutes were, and was produced by the breath of God, as theirs were not; nor theirs out of the earth, as his body was: and these two different productions show the different nature of the soul and body of man, the one is material and mortal, the other immaterial and immortal: <p>and man became a living soul; or a living man, not only capable of performing the functions of the animal life, of eating, drinking, walking, &amp;c. but of thinking, reasoning, and discoursing as a rational creature. <p>(h) Antiqu. l. 1. c. 1.((i) Opera &amp; dies, ver. 60.

These are supplied by the present narrative, which, beginning with the construction of his body from the fine dust of the ground, designedly represents it as an evolution or development of the material universe, and ends by setting it before us as animated by the breath of God, reserving for later treatment the mode of Eve's production, when the circumstances that led to it have been described. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (the Lord God) <span class="cmt_word">breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span> Literally, the breath of lives. "The formation of man from the dust and the breathing of the breath of life must not be understood in a mechanical sense, as if God first of all constructed a human figure from the dust" (still less does it admit of the idea that man's physical nature was evolved from the lower animals), "and then, by breathing his breath of life into the clod of earth which he had shaped into the form of a man, made it into a living being. The words are to be understood <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. By an act of Divine omnipotence man arose from the dust; and in the same moment in which the dust, by virtue of creative omnipotence, shaped itself into a human form, it was pervaded by the Divine breath of life, and created a living being, so that we cannot say the body was earlier than the soul" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">And man became a</span> <span class="cmt_word">living soul</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh chayyah</span>, in <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, 80, is employed to designate the lower animals. Describing a being animated by a <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> or life principle, it does not necessarily imply that the basis of the life principle in man and the inferior animals is the same. The distinction between the two appears from the difference in the mode of their creations. The beasts arose at the almighty fiat completed beings, every one a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>. "The origin of their soul was coincident with that of their corporeality, and their life was merely the individualization of the universal life with which all matter was filled at the beginning by the Spirit of God" (Delitzsch). Man received his life from a distinct act of Divine inbreathing; certainly not an in-breathing of atmospheric air, but an inflatus from the Ruach Elohim, or Spirit of God, a communication from the whole personality of the Godhead. In effect man was thereby constituted a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>, like the lower animals; but in him the life principle conferred a personality which was wanting in them. Thus there is no real contradiction, scarcely even an "<span class="accented">apparent</span> dissonance," between the two accounts of man's creation. The second exhibits the foundation of that likeness to God and world-dominion ascribed to him in the first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then Jehovah God formed man from dust of the ground." &#1506;&#1508;&#1512; is the accusative of the material employed (Ewald and Gesenius). The Vav consec. imperf. in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>, does not indicate the order of time, or of thought; so that the meaning is not that God planted the garden in Eden after He had created Adam, nor that He caused the trees to grow after He had planted the garden and placed the man there. The latter is opposed to <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>; the former is utterly improbable. The process of man's creation is described minutely here, because it serves to explain his relation to God and to the surrounding world. He was formed from dust (not de limo terrae, from a clod of the earth, for &#1506;&#1508;&#1512; is not a solid mass, but the finest part of the material of the earth), and into his nostril a breath of life was breathed, by which he became an animated being. Hence the nature of man consists of a material substance and an immaterial principle of life. "The breath of life," i.e., breath producing life, does not denote the spirit by which man is distinguished form the animals, or the soul of man from that of the beasts, but only the life-breath (vid., <a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17</a>). It is true, &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; generally signifies the human soul, but in <a href="/genesis/7-22.htm">Genesis 7:22</a> &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is used of men and animals both; and should any one explain this, on the ground that the allusion is chiefly to men, and the animals are connected per zeugma, or should he press the ruach attached, and deduce from this the use of neshamah in relation to men and animals, there are several passages in which neshamah is synonymous with ruach (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>; <a href="/job/32-8.htm">Job 32:8</a>; <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>), or &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; applied to animals (<a href="/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a>; <a href="/genesis/7-15.htm">Genesis 7:15</a>), or again neshamah used as equivalent to nephesh (e.g., (<a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>, cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/10-30.htm">Joshua 10:30</a>, <a href="/joshua/10-32.htm">Joshua 10:32</a>). For neshamah, the breathing, &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#769;, is "the ruach in action" (Auberlen). Beside this, the man formed from the dust became, through the breathing of the "breath of life," a &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, an animated, and as such a living being; an expression which is also applied to fishes, birds, and land animals (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm">Genesis 1:20-21</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>, <a href="/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a>), and there is no proof of pre-eminence on the part of man. As &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;, does not refer to the soul merely, but to the whole man as an animated being, so &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1492; does not denote the spirit of man as distinguished from body and soul. On the relation of the soul to the spirit of man nothing can be gathered from this passage; the words, correctly interpreted, neither show that the soul is an emanation, an exhalation of the human spirit, nor that the soul was created before the spirit and merely received its life from the latter. The formation of man from dust and the breathing of the breath of life we must not understand in a mechanical sense, as if God first of all constructed a human figure from dust, and then, by breathing His breath of life into the clod of earth which he had shaped into the form of a man, made it into a living being. The words are to be understood &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;. By an act of divine omnipotence man arose from the dust; and in the same moment in which the dust, by virtue of creative omnipotence, shaped itself into a human form, it was pervaded by the divine breath of life, and created a living being, so that we cannot say the body was earlier than the soul. The dust of the earth is merely the earthly substratum, which was formed by the breath of life from God into an animated, living, self-existent being. When it is said, "God breathed into his nostril the breath of life," it is evident that this description merely gives prominence to the peculiar sign of life, viz., breathing; since it is obvious, that what God breathed into man could not be the air which man breathes; for it is not that which breathes, but simply that which is breathed. Consequently, breathing into the nostril can only mean, that "God, through His own breath, produced and combined with the bodily form that principle of life, which was the origin of all human life, and which constantly manifests its existence in the breath inhaled and exhaled through the nose" (Delitzsch, Psychol. p. 62). Breathing, however, is common to both man and beast; so that this cannot be the sensuous analogon of the supersensuous spiritual life, but simply the principle of the physical life of the soul. Nevertheless the vital principle in man is different from that in the animal, and the human soul from the soul of the beast. This difference is indicated by the way in which man received the breath of life from God, and so became a living soul. "The beasts arose at the creative word of God, and no communication of the spirit is mentioned even in <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>; the origin of their soul was coincident with that of their corporeality, and their life was merely the individualization of the universal life, with which all matter was filled in the beginning by the Spirit of God.<p>On the other hand, the human spirit is not a mere individualization of the divine breath which breathed upon the material of the world, or of the universal spirit of nature; nor is his body merely a production of the earth when stimulated by the creative word of God. The earth does not bring forth his body, but God Himself puts His hand to the work and forms him; nor does the life already imparted to the world by the Spirit of God individualize itself in him, but God breathes directly into the nostrils of the one man, in the whole fulness of His personality, the breath of life, that in a manner corresponding to the personality of God he may become a living soul" (Delitzsch). This was the foundation of the pre-eminence of man, of his likeness to God and his immortality; for by this he was formed into a personal being, whose immaterial part was not merely soul, but a soul breathed entirely by God, since spirit and soul were created together through the inspiration of God. As the spiritual nature of man is described simply by the act of breathing, which is discernible by the senses, so the name which God gives him (<a href="/genesis/5-2.htm">Genesis 5:2</a>) is founded upon the earthly side of his being: Adam, from &#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1492; (adamah), earth, the earthly element, like homo from humus, or from &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, to guard him from self-exaltation, not from the red colour of his body, since this is not a distinctive characteristic of man, but common to him and to many other creatures. The name man (Mensch), on the other hand, from the Sanskrit ma&#770;nuscha, manuschja, from man to think, manas  equals  mens, expresses the spiritual inwardness of our nature. </body></html>
