If we should ever know what a famine of the word means, let us not think it much to travel as far for spiritual food, as they did for bodily food. Joseph's steward had orders from his master to take them to his house. Even this frightened them. Those that are guilty make the worst of every thing. But the steward encouraged them. It appears, from what he said, that by his good master he was brought to the knowledge of the true God, the God of the Hebrews. Religious servants should take all fit occasions to speak of God and his providence, with reverence and seriousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The invitation into Joseph's house fills the brothers with alarm. "Saw with them Benjamin." This was an unspeakable relief to Joseph, who was afraid that his full brother, also the favorite of his father, might have incurred the envy and persecution of the brothers. "Brought the men to Joseph's house." This he eventually did, but not until after the conference between him and them took place. The men were afraid of a plot to rob them of their liberty and property.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the men were afraid&#8212;Their feelings of awe on entering the stately mansion, unaccustomed as they were to houses at all, their anxiety at the reasons of their being taken there, their solicitude about the restored money, their honest simplicity in communicating their distress to the steward and his assurances of having received their money in "full weight," the offering of their fruit present, which would, as usual, be done with some parade, and the Oriental salutations that passed between their host and them&#8212;are all described in a graphic and animated manner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Take us for bondmen, </span> the proper punishment for thieves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house,....
