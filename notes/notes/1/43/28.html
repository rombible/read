Thus were Joseph's dreams more and more fulfilled. Joseph showed great kindness to them. He treated them nobly; but see here the early distance between Jews and gentiles. In a day of famine, it is enough to be fed; but they were feasted. Their cares and fears were now over, and they ate their bread with joy, reckoning they were upon good terms with the lord of the land. If God accept our works, our present, we have reason to be cheerful. Joseph showed special regard for Benjamin, that he might try whether his brethren would envy him. It must be our rule, to be content with what we have, and not to grieve at what others have. Thus Jesus shows those whom he loves, more and more of their need. He makes them see that he is their only refuge from destruction. He overcomes their unwillingness, and brings them to himself. Then, as he sees good, he gives them some taste of his love, and welcomes them to the provisions of his house, as an earnest of what he further intends for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They are now entertained by Joseph. They brought the present, and made a lowly obeisance before him. "They bent the head." See <a href="/genesis/24-26.htm">Genesis 24:26</a>. "God be gracious unto thee, my son." His kind treatment of Benjamin, on whose presence he had so much insisted, was calculated to reassure the brothers. The latter was born in his thirteenth year, and therefore, he was entitled to assume the paternal style in regard to him. Joseph still appeals with a natural and unconstrained reverence to his own God. "And Joseph hastened away." The little touch of tenderness he had involuntarily thrown into his address to Benjamin, is too much for his feelings, which yearn toward his brother, and he is obliged to retreat to his chamber to conceal his tears and compose his countenance. "They set for him by himself." As the governor, or as connected by affinity with the priestly caste, Joseph does not eat with the other Egyptians. The Egyptians cannot eat with the Hebrews. "That is an abomination to the Mizrites." For the Hebrews partook of the flesh of kine, both male and female.<p>But Herodotus informs us (ii. 41), that "male kine, if clean, are used by the Egyptians, but the females they are not allowed to sacrifice, since they are sacred to Isis." And he adds that "a native of Egypt will not kiss a Greek, use his knife, his spit, or his cauldron, or taste the flesh cut with a Greek knife." They considered all foreigners unclean, and therefore, refused to eat with them (see Rawlinson's Herodotus on p. q.). They sat in his presence; arranged according to the order of their birth, to their great amazement. Egypt was to them a land of wonders, and Egypt's sultan a man of wonder. "Benjamin's mess." The honored guest was distinguished by a larger or daintier portion of the fare (<a href="//biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-23.htm">1 Samuel 9:23-24</a>; Homer, ii. 7,321). A double portion was assigned to the Spartan kings. The fivefold division was prominent in Egyptian affairs <a href="/genesis/41-34.htm">Genesis 41:34</a>; <a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/47-2.htm">Genesis 47:2</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/47-24.htm">Genesis 47:24</a>, <a href="/genesis/47-26.htm">Genesis 47:26</a>. "And were merry." They drank freely, so as to be exhilarated, because their cares were dissipated by the kindness they were receiving, the presence of Simon, and the attention paid to Benjamin. <p> - The Ten Brothers Were Tested<p>Joseph has had the satisfaction of seeing his brother Benjamin safe and well. He has heard his brothers acknowledging their guilt concerning himself. He resolves to put their attachment to Benjamin, and the genuineness of their change of disposition, to a test that will at the same time expose Benjamin to no hazard.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the men were afraid&#8212;Their feelings of awe on entering the stately mansion, unaccustomed as they were to houses at all, their anxiety at the reasons of their being taken there, their solicitude about the restored money, their honest simplicity in communicating their distress to the steward and his assurances of having received their money in "full weight," the offering of their fruit present, which would, as usual, be done with some parade, and the Oriental salutations that passed between their host and them&#8212;are all described in a graphic and animated manner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy servant; </span> by which expression delivered in Jacob’s name, and by his order, Jacob himself <span class="ital">made obeisance to him, </span> as was foretold, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/37-9.htm" title="And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.">Genesis 37:9</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they answered, thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive,....

But the brethren were alarmed, thinking that they were taken into the house because of the money which returned the first time (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489; which came back, they could not imagine how), that he might take them unawares (lit., roll upon them), and fall upon them, and keep them as salves, along with their asses. For the purpose of averting what they dreaded, they approached (<a href="/genesis/43-19.htm">Genesis 43:19</a>) the steward and told him, "at the door of the house," before they entered therefore, how, at the first purchase of corn, on opening their sacks, they found the money that had been paid, "every one's money in the mouth of his sack, our money according to its weight," i.e., in full, and had now brought it back, together with some more money to buy corn, and they did not know who had put their money in their sacks (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/43-20.htm">Genesis 43:20-22</a>). The steward, who was initiated into Joseph's plans, replied in a pacifying tone, "Peace be to you (&#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; is not a form of salutation here, but of encouragement, as in <a href="/judges/6-23.htm">Judges 6:23</a>): fear not; your God and the God of your father has given you a treasure in your sacks; your money came to me;" and at the same time, to banish all their fear, he brought Simeon out to them. He then conducted them into Joseph's house, and received them in Oriental fashion as the guests of his lord. But, previous to Joseph's arrival, they arranged the present which they had brought with them, as they heard that they were to dine with him. </body></html>
