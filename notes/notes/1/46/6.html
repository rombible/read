Though the fulfilling of promises is always sure, yet it is often slow. It was now 215 years since God had promised Abraham to make of him a great nation, ch. 12:2; yet that branch of his seed, to which the promise was made sure, had only increased to seventy, of whom this particular account is kept, to show the power of God in making these seventy become a vast multitude.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The descent into Egypt is now described. "His daughters, and his sons' daughters." In the following list only one daughter of Jacob is mentioned, Dinah, and only one son's daughter, Serah. It is possible, but not probable, that there were more daughters than these at the time in his family. But even if there were no others, the plural is adopted in order to correspond with the general form of classification, from which the one daughter and the one granddaughter are merely accidental deviations. The same principle applies to the sons of Dan Gen 46:23, and to other instances in Scripture <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-8.htm">1 Chronicles 2:8</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>.<p>Verse 8-27<p>The list given here of the family of Jacob as it came down into Egypt is not to be identified with a list of their descendants two hundred and fifty years after, contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>, or with another list constructed after the captivity, and referring to certain of their descendants in and after the times of the monarchy. Nor is this the place to mark out or investigate the grounds of the diversities from the present which these later lists exhibit. Our proper business here is to examine into the nature and import of this ancient and original list of the family of Jacob. It purports to be a list of the names of the sons of Israel, "who went into Mizraim." This phrase implies that the sons of Israel actually went down into Egypt; and this is accordingly historically true of all his immediate sons, Joseph having gone thither about twenty-two years before the others. And the word "sons" is to be understood here in its strict sense, as we find it in the immediate context <a href="/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a> distinguished from sons' sons and other descendants.<p>"Jacob and his sons." From this expression we perceive the progenitor is to be included with the sons among those who descended to Egypt. This also is historically exact. For the sake of clearness it is proper here to state the approximate ages of these heads of Israel at the time of the descent. Jacob himself was 130 years of age <a href="/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>. Joseph was in his thirtieth year when he stood before Pharaoh to interpret his dreams and receive his commission as governor-general of Egypt, <a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>. At the end of the second year of the famine nine full years were added to his life. He was therefore, we may suppose, 39 years old when Jacob arrived in Egypt, and born when his father was 91. As we conceive that he was born in the fifteenth year of Jacob's sojourn in Padan-aram, and Reuben in the eighth, we infer that Reuben was at the time of the descent into Egypt seven years older than Joseph, or 46, Simon 45, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/44.htm">Leviticus 44</a>, Judah 43, Dan about 43, Naphtali about 42, Gad about 42, Asher about 41, Issakar about 41, Zebulun about 40, Dinah about 39, Benjamin about 26. "Jacob's first-born Reuben." This refers to the order of nature, without implying that the rights of first-birth were to be secured to Reuben <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. goods, which they had gotten in the land&#8212;not furniture, but substance&#8212;precious things.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the land of Canaan, </span> and in Mesopotamia.

It was not till they told him all that Joseph had said, and he saw the carriages that Joseph had sent, that "the spirit of their father Jacob revived; and Israel said: It is enough! Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die." Observe the significant interchange of Jacob and Israel. When once the crushed spirit of the old man was revived by the certainty that his son Joseph was still alive, Jacob was changed into Israel, the "conqueror overcoming his grief at the previous misconduct of his sons" (Fr. v. Meyer). </body></html>
