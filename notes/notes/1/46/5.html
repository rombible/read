Though the fulfilling of promises is always sure, yet it is often slow. It was now 215 years since God had promised Abraham to make of him a great nation, ch. 12:2; yet that branch of his seed, to which the promise was made sure, had only increased to seventy, of whom this particular account is kept, to show the power of God in making these seventy become a vast multitude.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The descent into Egypt is now described. "His daughters, and his sons' daughters." In the following list only one daughter of Jacob is mentioned, Dinah, and only one son's daughter, Serah. It is possible, but not probable, that there were more daughters than these at the time in his family. But even if there were no others, the plural is adopted in order to correspond with the general form of classification, from which the one daughter and the one granddaughter are merely accidental deviations. The same principle applies to the sons of Dan Gen 46:23, and to other instances in Scripture <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-8.htm">1 Chronicles 2:8</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/2-42.htm">1 Chronicles 2:42</a>.<p>Verse 8-27<p>The list given here of the family of Jacob as it came down into Egypt is not to be identified with a list of their descendants two hundred and fifty years after, contained in <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>, or with another list constructed after the captivity, and referring to certain of their descendants in and after the times of the monarchy. Nor is this the place to mark out or investigate the grounds of the diversities from the present which these later lists exhibit. Our proper business here is to examine into the nature and import of this ancient and original list of the family of Jacob. It purports to be a list of the names of the sons of Israel, "who went into Mizraim." This phrase implies that the sons of Israel actually went down into Egypt; and this is accordingly historically true of all his immediate sons, Joseph having gone thither about twenty-two years before the others. And the word "sons" is to be understood here in its strict sense, as we find it in the immediate context <a href="/genesis/46-7.htm">Genesis 46:7</a> distinguished from sons' sons and other descendants.<p>"Jacob and his sons." From this expression we perceive the progenitor is to be included with the sons among those who descended to Egypt. This also is historically exact. For the sake of clearness it is proper here to state the approximate ages of these heads of Israel at the time of the descent. Jacob himself was 130 years of age <a href="/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>. Joseph was in his thirtieth year when he stood before Pharaoh to interpret his dreams and receive his commission as governor-general of Egypt, <a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>. At the end of the second year of the famine nine full years were added to his life. He was therefore, we may suppose, 39 years old when Jacob arrived in Egypt, and born when his father was 91. As we conceive that he was born in the fifteenth year of Jacob's sojourn in Padan-aram, and Reuben in the eighth, we infer that Reuben was at the time of the descent into Egypt seven years older than Joseph, or 46, Simon 45, <a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/44.htm">Leviticus 44</a>, Judah 43, Dan about 43, Naphtali about 42, Gad about 42, Asher about 41, Issakar about 41, Zebulun about 40, Dinah about 39, Benjamin about 26. "Jacob's first-born Reuben." This refers to the order of nature, without implying that the rights of first-birth were to be secured to Reuben <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 46:5-27.

However refreshed and invigorated in spirit by the religious services at Beer-sheba, he was now borne down by the infirmities of advanced age; and, therefore, his sons undertook all the trouble and toil of the arrangements, while the enfeebled old patriarch, with the wives and children, was conveyed by slow and leisurely stages in the Egyptian vehicles sent for their accommodation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jacob rose up from Beersheba,....

P’s summarized account of the descent into Egypt. Observe the characteristic words “their goods which they had gotten”; “his seed”; “sons’ sons” and “sons’ daughters”; and the marked redundancy in style, similar to what is found in <a href="/genesis/12-5.htm" title="And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.">Genesis 12:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-18.htm" title="And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.">Genesis 31:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/36-6.htm" title="And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.">Genesis 36:6</a>; which are all from the P narrative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8–27</span> (P).

Thus the names of Er and Onan are only mentioned to be excluded from the total (<span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/46-12.htm" title="And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.

Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is included in the list of thirty and three “souls of his sons and his daughters,” her name being the only female name up to that point. And Jacob himself is reckoned in the thirty-three.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">d</span>) It should be noted, in the same connexion, that Leah’s sons are 32, and Zilpah’s 16; Rachel’s are 14, and Bilhah’s 7.

This arrangement is probably designed to assist the memory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">e</span>) The order which is followed in the list is that of the wives: (1) the sons of Leah (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/genesis/46-8.htm" title="And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn....">Genesis 46:8-15</a></span>); (2) the sons of Zilpah (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/genesis/46-16.htm" title="And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli....">Genesis 46:16-18</a></span>); (3) the sons of Rachel (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/genesis/46-19.htm" title="The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin....">Genesis 46:19-22</a></span>); (4) the sons of Bilhah (<span class="ital"><a href="/context/genesis/46-23.htm" title="And the sons of Dan; Hushim....">Genesis 46:23-25</a></span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob rose up</span> - having received new vigor from the vision (Calvin)  - <span class="cmt_word">from Beersheba</span> (it is not probable that his stay there was of more than a day or two's, perhaps only a night's, duration): and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, - "Unlike the heathen tribes around them, and Oriental nations generally, the family of Jacob gave honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel" (Lawson) - <span class="cmt_word">in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him</span> (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 45:19, 21). <span class="cmt_word">And they took their cattle, and their goods</span> (including probably their servants), <span class="cmt_word">which they had gotten in the land of Canaan</span>, -  Pharaoh had desired Jacob not to regard his stuff, because the good of all the land of Egypt was before him; but he wished not to take advantage of Pharaoh's goodness, or to owe greater obligations to him than he found necessary" (Lawson) - <span class="cmt_word">and came into Egypt,</span> - a scene depicted on the tomb of Chumhotep, the near relative and successor of Osirtasen I., at Benihassan, represents a company of immigrants, apparently Shemitic in their origin, entering Egypt with their goods, as well as women and children, borne upon asses. Without affirming that this was the Egyptian version of the descent of Israel into Egypt, it may serve as a striking illustration of that event (vide. Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 480, ed. 1878; Brugsch, 'Histoire d'Egypte,' p. 63; Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 37) - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob, and all his seed</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his descendants) <span class="cmt_word">with him: his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters</span> (this need not imply that Jacob had more daughters than Dinah, but may include his sons wives, who are not otherwise mentioned in this enumeration), <span class="cmt_word">and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.</span> The date of this event was in the 130th year of Jacob's life (<a href="/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>), and 215 years after the call of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>  <span class="date">B.C. 1728</span> (Usher), 1885 (Hales); or A.M. 2276 (Usher), 3526 (Hales). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/45.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When they got back, and brought word to their father, "Joseph is still living, yea (&#1493;&#1499;&#1497; an emphatic assurance, Ewald, 3306) he is ruler in all the land of Egypt, his heart stopped, for he believed them not;" i.e., his heart did not beat at this joyful news, for he put no faith in what they said. It was not till they told him all that Joseph had said, and he saw the carriages that Joseph had sent, that "the spirit of their father Jacob revived; and Israel said: It is enough! Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die." Observe the significant interchange of Jacob and Israel. When once the crushed spirit of the old man was revived by the certainty that his son Joseph was still alive, Jacob was changed into Israel, the "conqueror overcoming his grief at the previous misconduct of his sons" (Fr. v. Meyer). </body></html>
