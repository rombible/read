Though the fulfilling of promises is always sure, yet it is often slow. It was now 215 years since God had promised Abraham to make of him a great nation, ch. 12:2; yet that branch of his seed, to which the promise was made sure, had only increased to seventy, of whom this particular account is kept, to show the power of God in making these seventy become a vast multitude.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sons of Leah and their descendants are here enumerated. Reuben has four sons, who appear without variation in the other two lists <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/26-5.htm">Numbers 26:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>. Of the six sons of Simon, Ohad appears in the other lists, and Nemuel and Zerah appear as colloquial variations of Jemuel and Zohar. Such diversities in oral language are usual to this day in the East and elsewhere. "Son of a Kenaanitess." This implies that intermarriage with the Kenaanites was the exception to the rule in the family of Jacob. Wives might have been obtained from Hebrew, Aramaic, or at all events Shemite tribes who were living in their vicinity. The three sons of Levi are common to all the lists, with the slight variation of Gershom for Gershon. The sons of Judah are also unvaried. We are here reminded that Er and Onon died in the land of Kenaan <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm">Genesis 46:12</a>, and of course did not come down into Egypt. The extraordinary circumstances of Judah's family are recorded in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>:In order that Hezron and Hamul may have been born at the arrival of Jacob's household in Egypt, Judah's and Perez's first sons must have been born in the fourteenth year of their respective fathers. For the discussion of this matter see the remarks on that chapter. The four sons of Issakar occur in the other lists, with the variation of Jashub for Job. The three sons of Zebulun recur in the book of Numbers; but in the list of Chronicles no mention is made of his posterity. Dinah does not appear in the other lists. The descendants of Leah are in all thirty-two; six sons, one daughter, twenty-three grandsons, and two great grandsons. "All the souls, his sons and his daughters, were thirty and three." Here "all the souls" include Jacob himself, and "his sons and his daughters" are to be understood as a specification of what is included besides himself.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-27. all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten&#8212;Strictly speaking, there were only sixty-six went to Egypt; but to these add Joseph and his two sons, and Jacob the head of the clan, and the whole number amounts to seventy. In the speech of Stephen (Ac 7:14) the number is stated to be seventy-five; but as that estimate includes five sons of Ephraim and Manasseh (1Ch 7:14-20), born in Egypt, the two accounts coincide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the sons of Issachar, Tola, and Phuvah; and Job, and Shimron.
