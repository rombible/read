Cain slew Abel, his own brother, his own mother's son, whom he ought to have loved; his younger brother, whom he ought to have protected; a good brother, who had never done him any wrong. What fatal effects were these of our first parents' sin, and how must their hearts have been filled with anguish! Observe the pride, unbelief, and impenitence of Cain. He denies the crime, as if he could conceal it from God. He tries to cover a deliberate murder with a deliberate lie. Murder is a crying sin. Blood calls for blood, the blood of the murdered for the blood of the murderer. Who knows the extent and weight of a Divine curse, how far it reaches, how deep it pierces? Only in Christ are believers saved from it, and inherit the blessing. Cain was cursed from the earth. He found his punishment there where he chose his portion, and set his heart. Every creature is to us what God makes it, a comfort or a cross, a blessing or a curse. The wickedness of the wicked brings a curse upon all they do, and all they have. Cain complains not of his sin, but of his punishment. It shows great hardness of heart to be more concerned about our sufferings than our sins. God has wise and holy ends in prolonging the lives even of very wicked men. It is in vain to inquire what was the mark set upon Cain. It was doubtless known, both as a brand of infamy on Cain, and a token from God that they should not kill him. Abel, being dead, yet speaketh. He tells the heinous guilt of murder, and warns us to stifle the first risings of wrath, and teaches us that persecution must be expected by the righteous. Also, that there is a future state, and an eternal recompence to be enjoyed, through faith in Christ and his atoning sacrifice. And he tells us the excellency of faith in the atoning sacrifice and blood of the Lamb of God. Cain slew his brother, because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous, 1Jo 3:12. In consequence of the enmity put between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, the war broke out, which has been waged ever since. In this war we are all concerned, none are neuter; our Captain has declared, He that is not with me is against me. Let us decidedly, yet in meekness, support the cause of truth and righteousness against Satan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What hast thou done? - The Lord now charges him with his guilt: "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the soil."

I know what thou hast done; thou hast slain thy brother, thine own, thine only brother, a holy, righteous, and good man, who never gave thee any offence, or any just occasion of shedding his innocent blood: this he said as knowing what he had done, and to impress his mind with a sense of the evil, and to bring him to a confession of it, before the sentence was passed, that it might appear to all to be just, and of which there was full proof and evidence, as follows: <p>the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground; where it was split, and in which it was covered and hid, and where perhaps Cain had buried his body, that it might not be seen, and the murder not discovered; but God saw what was done, and the voice of innocent blood came into his ears, and cried for vengeance at his hands: it is in the original, "the voice of thy brother's bloods" (s), in the plural; which the Jews generally understood of the posterity that would have descended from Abel, had he not been murdered: the Targum of Onkelos is,"the voice of the blood of the seeds or generations that should come from thy brother;''see <a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a> or it may respect the blood of the seed of the woman, of all the righteous ones that should be slain in like manner. The Jerusalem Targum is,"the voice of the bloods of the multitude of the righteous that shall spring from Abel thy brother,''or succeed him; see <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>. Jarchi thinks it has reference to the many wounds which Cain gave him, from whence blood sprung; and every wound and every drop of blood, as it were, cried for vengeance on the murderer. <p>(s)  "vox Sanguinum", Pagninus, Montanus, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said, What hast thou done? the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</span><p><span class="cverse3">{i}</span> God avenges the wrongs against his saints, though no one complains: for the iniquity itself cries for vengeance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">What hast thou done?</span>] The same question as that put to Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-13.htm" title="And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that you have done?

The Hebrew for “voice” (<span class="ital">ḳôl</span>) should similarly be rendered “Hark!,” instead of “noise,” in <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm" title="The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts musters the host of the battle.">Isaiah 13:4</a>, and instead of “the voice of,” in <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm" title="Your watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.">Isaiah 52:8</a>; see Heb. Lexicon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Hebrew idea was that blood shed, for which there was no avenger, cried to Jehovah for vengeance against the murderer. Jehovah has learned of Abel’s murder from the cry of his blood spilt upon the ground. Another Hebrew belief was that, if only the blood were covered with earth, it would be silent. Cf. <a href="/job/16-18.htm" title="O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.">Job 16:18</a>, “Oh! earth, cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no resting-place”; <a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.">Isaiah 26:21</a>, “The earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain”; <a href="/ezekiel/24-7.htm" title="For her blood is in the middle of her; she set it on the top of a rock; she poured it not on the ground, to cover it with dust;">Ezekiel 24:7</a>. To this ancient supposition there is an allusion in <a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm" title="Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:">Hebrews 12:14</a>, “the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of Abel.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“In the picturesque legend of the Arabs, there rose from the blood (or bones) of the slain man the ‘death-owl,’ which shrieked, ‘Give me to drink,’ until it was appeased by the blood of vengeance.” (Gordon’s <span class="ital">Early Traditions of Genesis</span>, p. 203.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Satisfied that the guilty fratricide is resolved to make no acknowledgment of his deed, the omniscient Judge proceeds to charge him with his sin. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah - <span class="cmt_word">said, What hast thou done?</span> Thus intimating his perfect cognizance of the fact which his prisoner was attempting to deny.

The blood crying is a symbol of the soul crying for its right to live (Lange). In this instance the cry was a demand for the punishment of the murderer; and that cry has reverberated through all lands and down through all ages, proclaiming vengeance against the shedder of innocent blood (cf. <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>). "Hence the prayer that the earth may net drink in the blood shed upon it, in order that it may not thereby become invisible and inaudible" (Knobel). Cf. <a href="/job/16-18.htm">Job 16:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-7.htm">Ezekiel 24:7</a>; also Eschylus, 'Chaephorae,' 310, 398 (quoted by T.

Adam and Eve fear before God, and acknowledge their sin; Cain boldly denies it, and in reply to the question, "Where is Abel thy brother?" declares, "I know not, am I my brother's keeper?" God therefore charges him with his crime: "What hast thou done! voice of thy brother's blood crying to Me from the earth." The verb "crying" refers to the "blood," since this is the principal word, and the voice merely expresses the adverbial idea of "aloud," or "listen" (Ewald, 317d). &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (drops of blood) is sometimes used to denote natural hemorrhage (<a href="//biblehub.com/leviticus/12-4.htm">Leviticus 12:4-5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a>); but is chiefly applied to blood shed unnaturally, i.e., to murder. "Innocent blood has no voice, it may be, that is discernible by human ears, but it has one that reaches God, as the cry of a wicked deed demanding vengeance" (Delitzsch). Murder is one of the sins that cry to heaven. "Primum ostendit Deus se de factis hominum cognoscere utcunque nullus queratur vel accuset; deinde sibi magis charam esse homonum vitam quam ut sanguinem innoxium impune effundi sinat; tertio curam sibi piorum esse non solum quamdiu vivunt sed etiam post mortem" (Calvin). Abel was the first of the saints, whose blood is precious in the sight of God (<a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>); and by virtue of his faith, he being dead yet speaketh through his blood which cried unto God (<a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>). </body></html>
