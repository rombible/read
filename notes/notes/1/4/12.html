Cain slew Abel, his own brother, his own mother's son, whom he ought to have loved; his younger brother, whom he ought to have protected; a good brother, who had never done him any wrong. What fatal effects were these of our first parents' sin, and how must their hearts have been filled with anguish! Observe the pride, unbelief, and impenitence of Cain. He denies the crime, as if he could conceal it from God. He tries to cover a deliberate murder with a deliberate lie. Murder is a crying sin. Blood calls for blood, the blood of the murdered for the blood of the murderer. Who knows the extent and weight of a Divine curse, how far it reaches, how deep it pierces? Only in Christ are believers saved from it, and inherit the blessing. Cain was cursed from the earth. He found his punishment there where he chose his portion, and set his heart. Every creature is to us what God makes it, a comfort or a cross, a blessing or a curse. The wickedness of the wicked brings a curse upon all they do, and all they have. Cain complains not of his sin, but of his punishment. It shows great hardness of heart to be more concerned about our sufferings than our sins. God has wise and holy ends in prolonging the lives even of very wicked men. It is in vain to inquire what was the mark set upon Cain. It was doubtless known, both as a brand of infamy on Cain, and a token from God that they should not kill him. Abel, being dead, yet speaketh. He tells the heinous guilt of murder, and warns us to stifle the first risings of wrath, and teaches us that persecution must be expected by the righteous. Also, that there is a future state, and an eternal recompence to be enjoyed, through faith in Christ and his atoning sacrifice. And he tells us the excellency of faith in the atoning sacrifice and blood of the Lamb of God. Cain slew his brother, because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous, 1Jo 3:12. In consequence of the enmity put between the Seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent, the war broke out, which has been waged ever since. In this war we are all concerned, none are neuter; our Captain has declared, He that is not with me is against me. Let us decidedly, yet in meekness, support the cause of truth and righteousness against Satan.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The curse (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>, note) which now fell on Cain was in some sense retributive, as it sprang from the soil which had received his brother's blood. The particulars of it are the withdrawal of the full strength or fruitfulness of the soil from him, and the degradation from the state of a settled dweller in the presence of God to that of a vagabond in the earth. He was to be banished to a less productive part of the earth, removed from the presence of God and the society of his father and mother, and abandoned to a life of wandering and uncertainty. The sentence of death had been already pronounced upon man.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. a fugitive&#8212;condemned to perpetual exile; a degraded outcast; the miserable victim of an accusing conscience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Or, <span class="ital">that ground, </span> which doth or shall fall to thy share, besides the first and general curse inflicted upon the whole earth, shall have this peculiar curse added to it, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength, </span> i.e. its virtue and fruit, in such proportion as it hath hitherto done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A vagabond shalt thou be, </span> banished from thy own land and kindred, and father’s house, and from the whole society of the faithful, and wandering hither and thither.

Therefore, he will not be able to live on the cultivated ground. He must leave it and wander forth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">her strength</span>] That is, “her fruits.” So the Vulg. “fructus suos.” The word “strength” is used in this sense for the produce of the soil in <a href="/job/31-39.htm" title="If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:">Job 31:39</a>, “If I have eaten the fruits (marg. Heb. <span class="ital">strength</span>) thereof (i.e. of the land) without money.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a fugitive and a wanderer</span>] The alliteration of the two words in the original (<span class="ital">n‘â vâ-nâd</span>) is difficult to reproduce in English. The word for “a fugitive” means “one who staggers, or reels,” from weakness, faintness, or weariness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Weary and wandering,” or “staggering and straying” would be attempts at reproducing the original. The LXX <span class="greekheb">στένων καὶ τρέμως</span> = “groaning and trembling,” is more of a comment than a translation; and the Lat. “vagus et profugus,” like the English version, is inexact.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two points are to be noticed in this sentence upon Cain:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) He is sent forth from the cultivated soil: in other words, he is banished into the desert. He is to lead the life, neither of the shepherd, nor of the tiller of the soil, but of the roaming Bedouin of the desert.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) His wandering is not the result of a guilty conscience, but of a Divine sentence. It is his penalty to lead the nomad life of the desert, homeless and insecure and restless. Whereas Adam was banished from the garden to till the soil (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm" title="And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;">Genesis 3:17</a>), now that soil is to refuse its fruits to Cain, and he must fly into the desert.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And now (sc., because thou hast done this) be cursed from the earth." From: i.e., either away from the earth, driven forth so that it shall no longer afford a quiet resting-place (Gerlach, Delitzsch, etc.), or out of the earth, through its withdrawing its strength, and thus securing the fulfilment of perpetual wandering (Baumgarten, etc.). It is difficult to choose between the two; but the clause, "which hath opened her mouth," etc. seems rather to favour the latter. Because the earth has been compelled to drink innocent blood, it rebels against the murderer, and when he tills it, withdraws its strength, so that the soil yields no produce; just as the land of Canaan is said to have spued out the Canaanites, on account of their abominations (<a href="/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>). In any case, the idea that "the soil, through drinking innocent blood, became an accomplice in the sin of murder," has no biblical support, and is not confirmed by <a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a> or <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>. The suffering of irrational creatures through the sin of man is very different from their participating in his sin. "A fugitive and vagabond (&#1493;&#1504;&#1491; &#1504;&#1506;, i.e., banished and homeless) shalt thou be in the earth." Cain is so affected by this curse, that his obduracy is turned into despair, "My sin," he says in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/4-13.htm">Genesis 4:13</a>, "is greater than can be borne." &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; signifies to take away and bear sin or guilt, and is used with reference both to God and man. God takes guilt away by forgiving it (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>); man carries it away and bears it, by enduring its punishment (cf. <a href="/numbers/5-31.htm">Numbers 5:31</a>). Luther, following the ancient versions, has adopted the first meaning; but the context sustains the second: for Cain afterwards complains, not of the greatness of the sin, but only of the severity of the punishment. "Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from Thy face shall I be hid;...and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me." The adamah, from the face of which the curse of Jehovah had driven Cain, was Eden (cf. <a href="/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>), where he had carried on his agricultural pursuits, and where God had revealed His face, i.e., His presence, to the men after their expulsion from the garden; so that henceforth Cain had to wander about upon the wide world, homeless and far from the presence of God, and was afraid lest any one who found him might slay him. By "every one that findeth me" we are not to understand omnis creatura, as though Cain had excited the hostility of all creatures, but every man; not in the sense, however, of such as existed apart from the family of Adam, but such as were aware of his crime, and knew him to be a murderer. For Cain is evidently afraid of revenge on the part of relatives of the slain, that is to say, of descendants of Adam, who were either already in existence, or yet to be born. Though Adam might not at this time have had "many grandsons and great-grandson," yet according to <a href="/genesis/4-17.htm">Genesis 4:17</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/5-4.htm">Genesis 5:4</a>, he had undoubtedly other children, who might increase in number, and sooner or later might avenge Abel's death. For, that blood shed demands blood in return, "is a principle of equity written in the heart of every man; and that Cain should see that earth full of avengers is just like a murderer, who sees avenging spirits (&#x395;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) ready to torture him on every hand." </body></html>
