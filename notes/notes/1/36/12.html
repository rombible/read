As Balaam describes Amalek as “the beginning of nations” (so the Heb., <a href="/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a>), the race can scarcely have had so ignoble an origin as to have sprung from a concubine of Eliphaz; for we gather from <a href="/amos/6-1.htm" title="Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!">Amos 6:1</a> that the phrase used by Balaam implied precedence and nobility. It was, moreover, one of the most widely spread races of antiquity, occupying the whole country from Shur, on the borders of Egypt, to Havilah, in Arabia Felix. But probably there was a fusion of some of the Horites with the Amalekites, just as the Kenezites, under Caleb, were fused into the tribe of Judah. For in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/4-42.htm" title="And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.">1Chronicles 4:42-43</a>, we find the Simeonites invading Mount Seir, and smiting Amalekites there. Of these Amalekites in Seir, Amalek, the grandson of Esau, was probably the founder; for in <a href="/genesis/36-16.htm" title="Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.">Genesis 36:16</a> he is called <span class= "ital">a duke, </span>and therefore one district of the country would belong to his descendants, in the same manner as each son of Jacob had a territory called after his name. In this district the chiefs would be Semites of the race of Esau; the mass of the people a blended race of Horites. and Amalekites. There is no difficulty in the absence of their names from Genesis 10. Though Balaam magnified them, they were regarded by Israel, not as a nation, but as a hateful horde of plunderers.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/36.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>36:1-43 Esau and his descendants. - The registers in this chapter show the faithfulness of God to his promise to Abraham. Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage. Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind, and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children of God have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than mount Seir in possession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After the removal to Mount Seir the race of Esau is traced further. It is remarkable that the phrase, "And these are the generations of Esau," is now repeated. This is sufficient to show us that it does not necessarily indicate diversity of authorship, or is a very distinct piece of composition. Here it merely distinguishes the history of Esau's descent in Mount Seir from that in Kenaan. "Father of Edom." Edom here denotes the nation sprung from him. Eliphaz has five sons by his wife, and by a concubine a sixth, named Amalek, most probably the father of the Amalekites <a href="/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7</a>. "Timna" was probably a very young sister of Lotan <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-22.htm">Genesis 36:22</a>, perhaps not older than her niece Oholibamah <a href="/genesis/36-25.htm">Genesis 36:25</a>. Eliphaz was at least forty-one years younger than Esau. Yet it is curious that the father takes the niece to wife, and the son the aunt. "Teman" is the father of the Temanites, among whom we find Eliphaz the Temanite mentioned in Job J<a href="/obadiah/2-11.htm">Obadiah 2:11</a>. The name Kenaz may indicate some affinity of Edom with the Kenizzites <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-19.htm">Genesis 25:19</a>, though these were an older tribe. The other tribes are not of any note in history. Zepho is Zephi in Chronicles, by the change of a feeble letter. Such variations are not unusual in Hebrew speech, and so make their appearance in writing. Thus, in Genesis itself we have met with Mehujael and Mehijael, Peniel and Penuel <a href="/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30-31</a>. The sons of Esau by Oholibamah are younger than the other two, and hence, these sons are not enumerated along with those of the latter.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

His Settlement in the Mountains of Seir. - In the heading (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>) the surname Edom is added to the name Esau, which he received at his birth, because the former became the national designation of his descendants. - <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a>, <a href="/genesis/36-3.htm">Genesis 36:3</a>. The names of Esau's three wives differ from those given in the previous accounts (<a href="/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a> and <a href="/genesis/28-9.htm">Genesis 28:9</a>), and in one instance the father's name as well. The daughter of Elon the Hittite is called Adah (the ornament), and in <a href="/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a> Basmath (the fragrant); the second is called Aholibamah (probably tent-height), the daughter of Anah, daughter, i.e., grand-daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, and in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>, Jehudith (the praised or praiseworthy), daughter of Beeri the Hittite; the third, the daughter of Ishmael, is called Basmath here and Mahalath in <a href="/genesis/28-9.htm">Genesis 28:9</a>. This difference arose from the fact, that Moses availed himself of genealogical documents for Esau's family and tribe, and inserted them without alteration. It presents no irreconcilable discrepancy, therefore, but may be explained from the ancient custom in the East, of giving surnames, as the Arabs frequently do still, founded upon some important or memorable event in a man's life, which gradually superseded the other name (e.g., the name Edom, as explained in <a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>); whilst as a rule the women received new names when they were married (cf. Chardin, Hengstenberg, Dissertations, vol. ii. p. 223-6). The different names given for the father of Aholibamah or Judith, Hengstenberg explains by referring to the statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-24.htm">Genesis 36:24</a>, that Anah, the son of Zibeon, while watching the asses of his father in the desert, discovered the warm springs (of Calirrhoe), on which he founds the acute conjecture, that from this discovery Anah received the surname Beeri, i.e., spring-man, which so threw his original name into the shade, as to be the only name given in the genealogical table. There is no force in the objection, that according to <a href="/genesis/36-25.htm">Genesis 36:25</a> Aholibamah was not a daughter of the discoverer of the springs, but of his uncle of the same name. For where is it stated that the Aholibamah mentioned in <a href="/genesis/36-25.htm">Genesis 36:25</a> was Esau's wife? And is it a thing unheard of that aunt and niece should have the same name? If Zibeon gave his second son the name of his brother Anah (cf. <a href="/genesis/36-24.htm">Genesis 36:24</a> and <a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a>), why could not his son Anah have named his daughter after his cousin, the daughter of his father's brother? The reception of Aholibamah into the list of the Seirite princes is no proof that she was Esau's wife, but may be much more naturally supposed to have arisen from the same (unknown) circumstance as that which caused one of the seats of the Edomitish Alluphim to be called by her name (<a href="/genesis/36-41.htm">Genesis 36:41</a>). - Lastly, the remaining diversity, viz., that Anah is called a Hivite in <a href="/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a> and a Hittite in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a>, is not to be explained by the conjecture, that for Hivite we should read Horite, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a>, but by the simple assumption that Hittite is used in <a href="/genesis/26-34.htm">Genesis 26:34</a> sensu latiori for Canaanite, according to the analogy of <a href="/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; just as the two Hittite wives of Esau are called daughters of Canaan in <a href="/genesis/28-8.htm">Genesis 28:8</a>. For the historical account, the general name Hittite sufficed; but the genealogical list required the special name of the particular branch of the Canaanitish tribes, viz., the Hivites. In just as simple a manner may the introduction of the Hivite Zibeon among the Horites of Seir (<a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> and <a href="/genesis/36-24.htm">Genesis 36:24</a>) be explained, viz., on the supposition that the removed to the mountains of Seir, and there became a Horite, i.e., a troglodyte, or dweller in a cave. - The names of Esau's sons occur again in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-35.htm">1 Chronicles 1:35</a>. The statement in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/36-7.htm">Genesis 36:7</a>, that Esau went with his family and possessions, which he had acquired in Canaan, into the land of Seir, from before his brother Jacob, does not imply (in contradiction to <a href="/genesis/32-4.htm">Genesis 32:4</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/33-14.htm">Genesis 33:14-16</a>) that he did not leave the land of Canaan till after Jacob's return. The words may be understood without difficulty as meaning, that after founding a house of his own, when his family and flocks increased, Esau sought a home in Seir, because he knew that Jacob, as the heir, would enter upon the family possessions, but without waiting till he returned and actually took possession. In the clause "went into the country" (<a href="/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6</a>), the name Seir or Edom (cf. <a href="/genesis/36-16.htm">Genesis 36:16</a>) must have dropt out, as the words "into the country" convey no sense when standing by themselves. </body></html>
