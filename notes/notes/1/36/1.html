It begins with an enumeration of Esau’s wives, in which the names are different from those given in <a href="/genesis/26-34.htm" title="And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:">Genesis 26:34</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-9.htm" title="Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.">Genesis 28:9</a>. Next we have the genealogy of Esau, upon the same principle as that whereby the <span class= "ital">tôldôth </span>Ishmael was inserted immediately after the history of Abraham’s death (<a href="/context/genesis/25-12.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham:">Genesis 25:12-18</a>); but this is followed, in <a href="/context/genesis/36-20.htm" title="These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,">Genesis 36:20-30</a>, by a genealogy of the Horite inhabitants of Mount Seir. Among these Esau dwelt as the predominant power, but nevertheless on friendly terms, for a reason which we shall see hereafter. We next have a list of kings who are said to have reigned in Edom “before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.” This is not a prophetical portion of the Bible, but a dry genealogical table, and the attempts made to evade the plain meaning of the words, namely, that at the time when this list of kings was written there were kings in Israel, are painful to read, and can have no other effect than to harden sceptics in unbelief. Of these Edomite kings, it is remarkable that they do not succeed one another by hereditary succession, nor have they the same capital, but seem to belong to a time of anarchy, like that which existed in Israel under the Judges. During this period the Edomites and Horites were fused together, chiefly by conquest (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm" title="The Horims also dwelled in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-22.htm" title="As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead even to this day:">Deuteronomy 2:22</a>), but partly also by the gradual dying out of the inferior race, just as the red man is fading away in North America, and the Maori in New Zealand. Finally, we have a list of the eleven dukes of Edom, “after their places.” As these dukes represented tribes or clans, this catalogue is geographical, and as such it is described in <a href="/genesis/36-43.htm" title="Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.">Genesis 36:43</a>, and was intended to give the political arrangement of the land at the later date when this addition was made, and when considerable changes had taken place since the time of the first settlement.<p>These last two documents, forming <a href="/context/genesis/36-31.htm" title="And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.">Genesis 36:31-43</a>, were probably added at the time when the Books of Samuel were composed; but as we find the list of the kings given also in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/1-43.htm" title="Now these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel; Bela the son of Beor: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.">1Chronicles 1:43-50</a>, and as at that date great activity existed in completing the canon of Holy Scripture, some suppose that the lists in both places are by the same hand. It is entirely wrong to describe them as interpolations; for it was the rule to add to and complete genealogies; and besides there existed in the Jewish Church a living authority in the prophets who had the right and power to make necessary additions to the Divine record. It is to the “schools of the prophets” that we owe, under God’s providence, the existence of most of the Old Testament Scriptures, and the preservation of all of them; and they did not preserve them for the sake of the authors, but for the sake of what was written. And there is nothing derogatory to the authority or inspiration of Holy Scripture in believing that the prophets were from time to time moved by the Spirit to add to what had been written. The contents of the Old Testament bear witness everywhere to the scrupulous fidelity with which men guarded in the prophetic schools the sacred deposit entrusted to their care; but it is equally certain that we find notes inserted from time to time, as in <a href="/genesis/35-20.htm" title="And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.">Genesis 35:20</a>. No one can doubt but that the remark that the pillar standing on Rachel’s grave “unto this day” was the same stone which Jacob had set up, was inserted at a later date, and apparently after the conquest of Canaan. So in <a href="/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a> we have a note inserted subsequently to the establishment of the kingly office. Why should there be any difficulty in believing that these two lists of kings and dukes, added to complete a genealogy, belonged also to a time when there were kings in Israel?<p>It is probable, however, that the list of kings given here is of an earlier date than that in the first chapter of Chronicles, for Hadar (more correctly, in Chronicles, Hadad) seems to have been living when this document was composed, and hence the full information about his wife.” In Chronicles (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-51.htm" title="Hadad died also. And the dukes of Edom were; duke Timnah, duke Aliah, duke Jetheth,">1Chronicles 1:51</a>) there is added “Hadad died-also.” And if he really were alive when this catalogue was written, he had by that time been dead for centuries; for its date would then be one comparatively early.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/36.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/36-1.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.">Genesis 36:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">These are the generations of Esau — </span>Esau has the honour of having an account of his posterity recorded, for the sake of his progenitors, Abraham and Isaac, and because the Edomites, his descendants, were neighbours to Israel, and their genealogy would be of use to cast light on the following relations of what passed between them.

Esau is here called Edom, that name which kept up the remembrance of his selling his birth-right for a mess of pottage. Esau continued the same profane despiser of heavenly things. In outward prosperity and honour, the children of the covenant are often behind, and those that are out of the covenant get the start. We may suppose it a trial to the faith of God's Israel, to hear of the pomp and power of the kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in Egypt; but those that look for great things from God, must be content to wait for them; God's time is the best time. Mount Seir is called the land of their possession. Canaan was at this time only the land of promise. Seir was in the possession of the Edomites. The children of this world have their all in hand, and nothing in hope, Lu 16:25; while the children of God have their all in hope, and next to nothing in hand. But, all things considered, it is beyond compare better to have Canaan in promise, than mount Seir in possession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage is introductory, and records the settlement of Esau with his family in Mount Seir. "Esau, who is Edom." This is a fact of which we were informed in the previous history <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a>, <a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>. It is mentioned here because the latter name gave origin to the national designation; namely, the Edomites or Idumaeans. The occurrence of this explanatory or definitive clause here and in other parts of this chapter throws light on the manner in which this work was composed. Such parenthetical explanations are sometimes ascribed to the reviser or redactor of the original text. And to this there is no theoretic objection, provided the reviser be allowed to be of equal authority with the original author, and the explanatory addition be necessary for the reader of a later period, and could not have been furnished by the original author. Otherwise, such a mode of accounting for these simple clauses is unnecessary, and therefore, unwarrantable. The present case the writer has already explained, and the latest reader requires the clause no more than the earliest, as he is aware from the previous notices that Esau is Edom. We are thus led to regard these explanatory clauses as marks of an early or artless simplicity of style, and not as any clear or certain traces of revision.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 36<p>Ge 36:1-43.
