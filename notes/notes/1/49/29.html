He spoke about his burial-place, from a principle of faith in the promise of God, that Canaan should be the inheritance of his seed in due time. When he had finished both his blessing and his charge, and so had finished his testimony, he addressed himself to his dying work. He gathered up his feet into the bed, not only as one patiently submitting to the stroke, but as one cheerfully composing himself to rest, now that he was weary. He freely gave up his spirit into the hand of God, the Father of spirits. If God's people be our people, death will gather us to them. Under the care of the Shepherd of Israel, we shall lack nothing for body or soul. We shall remain unmoved until our work is finished; then, breathing out our souls into His hands for whose salvation we have waited, we shall depart in peace, and leave a blessing for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After the benediction Jacob gives directions concerning his burial. "All these are the twelve tribes". This implies that the benedictions refer not to the heads only, but to the whole tribes. "Each according to his blessing." All are blessed, but the form of the blessing is suited to the character of the individual "Bury me with my fathers" - with Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Leah. This dying command he now lays on the twelve, as he had before bound Joseph by oath to its performance. "Gathered up his feet into the bed." He had been sitting upright while pronouncing the benedictory address and giving his last directions. He now lies down and calmly breathes his last. <p> - The Burial of Jacob<p>10. &#1488;&#1496;&#1491;  'a&#772;t&#803;a&#770;d Atad, "the buck-thorn."<p>11. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;  'a&#772;be&#770;l-m&#305;&#770;tsray&#305;&#770;m, Abel-Mitsraim, "mourning of Mizraim," or meadow of Mizraim.<p>This chapter records the burial of Jacob and the death of Joseph, and so completes the history of the chosen family, and the third bible for the instruction of man.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. he charged them&#8212;The charge had already been given and solemnly undertaken (Ge 47:31).

From the simile of the fruit-tree Jacob passed to a warlike figure, and described the mighty and victorious unfolding of the tribe of Joseph in conflict with all its foes, describing with prophetic intuition the future as already come (vid., the perf. consec.). The words are not to be referred to the personal history of Joseph himself, to persecutions received by him from his brethren, or to his sufferings in Egypt; still less to any warlike deeds of his in Egypt (Diestel): they merely pointed to the conflicts awaiting his descendants, in which they would constantly overcome all hostile attacks. &#1502;&#1512;&#1512;: Piel, to embitter, provoke, lacessere. &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;: perf. o from &#1512;&#1489;&#1489; to shoot. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;: "in a strong, unyielding position" (Del.). &#1508;&#1468;&#1494;&#1494;: to be active, flexible; only found here, and in <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a> of a brisk movement, skipping or jumping. &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;: the arms, "without whose elasticity the hands could not hold or direct the arrow." The words which follow, "from the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob," are not to be linked to what follows, in opposition to the Masoretic division of the verses; they rather form one sentence with what precedes: "pliant remain the arms of his hands from the hands of God," i.e., through the hands of God supporting them. "The Mighty One of Jacob," He who had proved Himself to be the Mighty One by the powerful defence afforded to Jacob; a title which is copied from this passage in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, etc. "From thence," an emphatic reference to Him, from whom all perfection comes - "from the Shepherd (<a href="/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>) and Stone of Israel." God is called "the Stone," and elsewhere "the Rock" (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, etc.), as the immoveable foundation upon which Israel might trust, might stand firm and impregnably secure.</body></html>
