The cause of God and his people, though for a time it may seem to be baffled and run down, will be victorious at last. It represents the Christian's conflict. Grace in the soul is often foiled in its conflicts; troops of corruption overcome it, but the cause is God's, and grace will in the end come off conqueror, yea, more than conqueror, Ro 8:37. Asher should be a rich tribe. His inheritance bordered upon Carmel, which was fruitful to a proverb. Naphtali, is a hind let loose. We may consider it as a description of the character of this tribe. Unlike the laborious ox and ass; desirous of ease and liberty; active, but more noted for quick despatch than steady labour and perseverance. Like the suppliant who, with goodly words, craves mercy.

There is a paronomasia, or an allusion to the name of Gad almost in every word of the verse, which signifies a troop: the whole is a prediction that this tribe would be a warlike one, and have the common fate of war, sometimes be conquered, and at other times conquer, but however should be at last entirely victorious; all the three Targums refer this to this tribe passing over Jordan at the head of the armies of Israel, into the land of Canaan, in Joshua's time, which, when they had subdued, they returned to their own inheritance on the other side Jordan, <a href="/joshua/1-12.htm">Joshua 1:12</a> and so Jarchi; but it rather seems to refer to what befell them in their own tribe, which being seated on the other side Jordan was exposed to the incursions and spoils of the Moabites and Amonites; who came upon them like troops of robbers, and seized upon their possessions and retained them for some years; as in the times of the judges, see <a href="/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7</a> and in after times we find the Ammonites in possession of their country, <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1</a> whereby this part of the prophecy had its accomplishment: <p>but he shall overcome at the last; as the Gadites with the Reubenites and half tribe of Manasseh did overcome the Hagarites and Arabians, the war being of God, and succeeded, and they dwelt in their stead until the captivity of the ten tribes, <a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a> and thus it is with the people of God in their present warfare state, who are often foiled with sin, Satan, and the world, their spiritual enemies; but at last they are more than conquerors over them all through Christ that has loved them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/49.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/49.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">a troop</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">gedud</span>, “a marauding band.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall press</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">gad</span>, to press.

Later on, however, the tribe seems to have succumbed. <a href="/jeremiah/49-1.htm" title="Concerning the Ammonites, thus said the LORD; Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?">Jeremiah 49:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">upon their heel</span>] i.e. he will repulse and pursue them closely, and hang upon their rear.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</span> The threefold alliteration of the original, which is lost in the received translation, may be thus expressed: "Gad - a press presses him, but he presses the heel' (Keil); or, "troops shall troop on him, but he shall troop on their retreat' ('Speaker's Commentary'). The language refers to attacks of nomadic tribes which would harass and annoy the Gadites, but which they would successfully repel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Zebulun, to the shore of the ocean will he dwell, and indeed (&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; isque) towards the coast of ships, and his side towards Zidon (directed up to Zidon)." This blessing on Leah's sixth son interprets the name Zebulun (i.e., dwelling) as an omen, not so much to show the tribe its dwelling-place in Canaan, as to point out the blessing which it would receive from the situation of its inheritance (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>). So far as the territory allotted to the tribe of Zebulun under Joshua can be ascertained from the boundaries and towns mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10-16</a>, it neither reached to the Mediterranean, nor touched directly upon Zidon (see my Comm. on Joshua). It really lay between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean, near to both, but separated from the former by Naphtali, from the latter by Asher. So far was this announcement, therefore, from being a vaticinium ex eventu taken from the geographical position of the tribe, that it contains a decided testimony to the fact that Jacob's blessing was not written after the time of Joshua. &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; denotes, not the two seas mentioned above, but, as <a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a> proves, the Mediterranean, as a great ocean (<a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>). "The coast of ships:" i.e., where ships are unloaded, and land the treasures of the distant parts of the world for the inhabitants of the maritime and inland provinces (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.htm">Deuteronomy 33:19</a>). Zidon, as the old capital, stands for Phoenicia itself. </body></html>
