The character of Reuben is, that he was unstable as water. Men do not thrive, because they do not fix. Reuben's sin left a lasting infamy upon his family. Let us never do evil, then we need not fear being told of it. Simeon and Levi were passionate and revengeful. The murder of the Shechemites is a proof of this. Jacob protested against that barbarous act. Our soul is our honour; by its powers we are distinguished from, and raised above, the beasts that perish. We ought, from our hearts, to abhor all bloody and mischievous men. Cursed be their anger. Jacob does not curse their persons, but their lusts. I will divide them. The sentence as it respects Levi was turned into a blessing. This tribe performed an acceptable service in their zeal against the worshippers of the golden calf, Ex 32. Being set apart to God as priests, they were in that character scattered through the nation of Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Simon and Levi are brethren," by temper as well as by birth. Their weapons. This word is rendered plans, devices, by some. But the present rendering agrees best with the context. Weapons may be properly called instruments of violence; but not so plots. "Habitations" requires the preposition in before it, which is not in the original, and is not to be supplied without necessity. "Into their counsel." This refers to the plot they formed for the destruction of the inhabitants of Shekem. "They houghed an ox." The singular of the original is to be understood as a plural denoting the kind of acts to which they were prompted in their passion for revenge. Jacob pronounces a curse upon their anger, not because indignation against sin is unwarrantable in itself, but because their wrath was marked by deeds of fierceness and cruelty. "I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel." He does not cut them off from any part in the promised inheritance; but he divides and scatters them.<p>Accordingly they are divided from one another in their after history, the tribe of Simon being settled in the southwest corner of the territory of Judah, and Levi having no connected territory, but occupying certain cities and their suburbs which were assigned to his descendants in the various provinces of the land. They were also scattered in Israel. For Simon is the weakest of all the tribes at the close of their sojourn in the wilderness <a href="/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>; he is altogether omitted in the blessing of Moses <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, and hence, obtains no distinct territory, but only a part of that of Judah <a href="//biblehub.com/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>; and he subsequently sends out two colonies, which are separated from the parent stock, and from one another <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24-43</a>. And Levi received forty-eight towns in the various districts of the land, in which his descendants dwelt, far separated from one another. This prediction was therefore, fulfilled to the letter in the history of these brothers.

Simeon and Levi were associate in wickedness, and the same prediction would be equally applicable to both their tribes. Levi had cities allotted to them (Jos 21:1-45) in every tribe. On account of their zeal against idolatry, they were honorably "divided in Jacob"; whereas the tribe of Simeon, which was guilty of the grossest idolatry and the vices inseparable from it, were ignominiously "scattered."<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Simeon and Levi are brethren; </span> not only by nature, but in iniquity; of like cruel and bloody disposition, confederate in the same wicked design, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/34-25.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each man his sword, and came on the city boldly, and slew all the males.">Genesis 34:25</a></span>.

Some think the word here used is the Greek word for a sword; and the Jews say (h) that Jacob cursed the swords of Simeon and Levi in the Greek tongue; and others say it is Persic, being used by Xenophon for Persian swords; but neither of them seems probable: rather this word was originally Hebrew, and so passed from thence into other languages; but perhaps the sense of it, which Aben Ezra gives, may be most agreeable, if the first sense is not admitted, that it signifies covenants, compacts, agreements (i), such as these men made with the Shechemites, even nuptial contracts; for the root of the word, in the Chaldee language, signifies to espouse (k); and these they abused to cruelty, bloodshed, and slaughter, in a most deceitful manner: in the Ethiopic language, the word signifies counsels; so De Dieu takes it here. <p>(f) "--------par nobile fratrum Nequitia et nugis pravorum et amore gemellum."

They had been confederate in their wickedness, they should in future, when returning to occupy their God. assigned inheritance, be disjoined. That this prediction was exactly fulfilled Scripture testifies. At the second census in the wilderness, shortly before the conquest, the tribe of Simeon had become so reduced in its numbers (reckoning only 22,000 as against 76,500 in Judah) as to be the smallest of the twelve (<a href="/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>); to be passed over entirely in the last blessing of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>.); to be accorded no independent allotment of territory in Canaan on the completion of the conquest, having only a few cities granted to it within the borders of Judah (<a href="/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1-9</a>); and to be ultimately absorbed in the more powerful and distinguished tribe under whose protection and tutelage, so to speak, it had been placed (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>). The tribe of Levi also was deprived of a separate inheritance, receiving only a number of cities scattered here and there among the possessions of their brethren (<a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1, 40</a>); and, though by its election to the priesthood the curse may be said to have been turned into a blessing, yet of this signal honor which was waiting Levi Jacob was completely silent, showing both that no prophecy was of any private interpretation (the seer seeing no further than the Holy Spirit helped him), and that Jacob spoke before the days of Moses. It is almost incredible that a late writer would have omitted to forecast the latter-day glory of the tribe of Levi; and this opinion is confirmed by observing the very different strain in which, after Levi s calling had been revealed, the benediction of Moses himself proceeds (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Joseph observed his father placing his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, the younger son, he laid hold of it to put it upon Manasseh's head, telling his father at the same time that he was the first-born; but Jacob replied, "I know, my son, I:know: he also (Manasseh) will become a nation, and will become great, yet (&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; as in <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>) his younger brother will become greater than he, and his seed will become the fulness of nations." This blessing began to be fulfilled from the time of the Judges, when the tribe of Ephraim so increased in extent and power, that it took the lead of the northern tribes and became the head of the ten tribes, and its name acquired equal importance with the name Israel, whereas under Moses, Manasseh had numbered 20,000 more than Ephraim (<a href="/numbers/26-34.htm">Numbers 26:34</a> and <a href="/numbers/26-37.htm">Numbers 26:37</a>). As a result of the promises received from God, the blessing was not merely a pious wish, but the actual bestowal of a blessing of prophetic significance and force. - In <a href="/genesis/48-20.htm">Genesis 48:20</a> the writer sums up the entire act of blessing in the words of the patriarch: "In thee (i.e., Joseph) will Israel (as a nation) bless, saying: God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh" (i.e., Joseph shall be so blessed in his two sons, that their blessing will become a standing form of benediction in Israel); "and thus he placed Ephraim before Manasseh," viz., in the position of his hands and the terms of the blessing. Lastly, (<a href="/genesis/48-21.htm">Genesis 48:21</a>) Israel expressed to Joseph his firm faith in the promise, that God would bring back his descendants after his death into the land of their fathers (Canaan), and assigned to him a double portion in the promised land, the conquest of which passed before his prophetic glance as already accomplished, in order to insure for the future the inheritance of the adopted sons of Joseph. "I give thee one ridge of land above thy brethren" (i.e., above what thy brethren receive, each as a single tribe), "which I take from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow" (i.e., by force of arms). As the perfect is used prophetically, transposing the future to the present as being already accomplished, so the words &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; must also be understood prophetically, as denoting that Jacob would wrest the land from the Amorites, not in his own person, but in that of his posterity.<p>(Note: There is no force in Kurtz's objection, that this gift did not apply to Joseph as the father of Ephraim and Manasseh, but to Joseph personally; for it rests upon the erroneous assumption, that Jacob separated Joseph from his sons by their adoption. But there is not a word to that effect in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/48-6.htm">Genesis 48:6</a>, and the very opposite in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>, viz., that Jacob blessed Joseph in Ephraim and Manasseh. Heim's conjecture, which Kurtz approves, that by the land given to Joseph we are to understand the high land of Gilead, which Jacob had conquered from the Amorites, needs no refutation, for it is purely imaginary.)<p>The words cannot refer to the purchase of the piece of ground at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>), for a purchase could not possibly be called a conquest by sword and bow; and still less to the crime committed by the sons of Jacob against the inhabitants of Shechem, when they plundered the town (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>.), for Jacob could not possibly have attributed to himself a deed for which he had pronounced a curse upon Simeon and Levi (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6-7</a>), not to mention the fact, that the plundering of Shechem was not followed in this instance by the possession of the city, but by the removal of Jacob from the neighbourhood. "Moreover, any conquest of territory would have been entirely at variance with the character of the patriarchal history, which consisted in the renunciation of all reliance upon human power, and a believing, devoted trust in the God of the promises" (Delitzsch). The land, which the patriarchs desired to obtain in Canaan, they procured not by force of arms, but by legal purchase (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a> and <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>). It was to be very different in the future, when the iniquity of the Amorites was full (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). But Jacob called the inheritance, which Joseph was to have in excess of his brethren, &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501; (lit., shoulder, or more properly nape, neck; here figuratively a ridge, or tract of land), as a play upon the word Shechem, because he regarded the piece of land purchased at Shechem as a pledge of the future possession of the whole land. In the piece purchased there, the bones of Joseph were buried, after the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>); and this was understood in future times, as though Jacob had presented the piece of ground to Joseph (vid., <a href="/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>). </body></html>
