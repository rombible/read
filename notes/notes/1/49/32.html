He spoke about his burial-place, from a principle of faith in the promise of God, that Canaan should be the inheritance of his seed in due time. When he had finished both his blessing and his charge, and so had finished his testimony, he addressed himself to his dying work. He gathered up his feet into the bed, not only as one patiently submitting to the stroke, but as one cheerfully composing himself to rest, now that he was weary. He freely gave up his spirit into the hand of God, the Father of spirits. If God's people be our people, death will gather us to them. Under the care of the Shepherd of Israel, we shall lack nothing for body or soul. We shall remain unmoved until our work is finished; then, breathing out our souls into His hands for whose salvation we have waited, we shall depart in peace, and leave a blessing for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After the benediction Jacob gives directions concerning his burial. "All these are the twelve tribes". This implies that the benedictions refer not to the heads only, but to the whole tribes. "Each according to his blessing." All are blessed, but the form of the blessing is suited to the character of the individual "Bury me with my fathers" - with Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Leah. This dying command he now lays on the twelve, as he had before bound Joseph by oath to its performance. "Gathered up his feet into the bed." He had been sitting upright while pronouncing the benedictory address and giving his last directions. He now lies down and calmly breathes his last. <p> - The Burial of Jacob<p>10. &#1488;&#1496;&#1491;  'a&#772;t&#803;a&#770;d Atad, "the buck-thorn."<p>11. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;  'a&#772;be&#770;l-m&#305;&#770;tsray&#305;&#770;m, Abel-Mitsraim, "mourning of Mizraim," or meadow of Mizraim.<p>This chapter records the burial of Jacob and the death of Joseph, and so completes the history of the chosen family, and the third bible for the instruction of man.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. he charged them&#8212;The charge had already been given and solemnly undertaken (Ge 47:31).

The blessing of thy father surpass the blessings of my progenitors to the border of the everlasting hills, may they come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the illustrious among his brethren." From the form of a description the blessing passes in <a href="/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a> into the form of a desire, in which the "from" of the previous clause is still retained. The words "and may He help thee," "may He bless thee," form parentheses, for "who will help and bless thee." &#1493;&#1488;&#1514; is neither to be altered into &#1493;&#1488;&#1500; (and from God), as Ewald suggests, in accordance with the lxx, Sam., Syr., and Vulg., nor into &#1502;&#1488;&#1514; as Knobel proposes; and even the supplying of &#1502;&#1503; before &#1488;&#1514; from the parallel clause (Ges. 154, 4) is scarcely allowable, since the repetition of &#1502;&#1503; before another preposition cannot be supported by any analogous case; but &#1488;&#1514; may be understood here, as in <a href="/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>, in the sense of helpful communion: "and with," i.e., with (in) the fellowship of, "the Almighty, may He bless thee, let there be (or come) blessings," etc. The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1503; follows in <a href="/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a> after the whole subject, which is formed of many parallel members. The blessings were to come from heaven above and from the earth beneath. From the God of Jacob and by the help of the Almighty should the rain and dew of heaven (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>), and fountains and brooks which spring from the great deep or the abyss of the earth, pour their fertilizing waters over Joseph's land, "so that everything that had womb and breast should become pregnant, bring forth, and suckle."<p>(Note: "Thus is the whole composed in pictorial words. Whatever of man and cattle can be fruitful shall multiply and have enough. Childbearing, and the increase of cattle, and of the corn in the field, are not our affair, but the mercy and blessing of God." - Luther.)<p>&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; from &#1492;&#1512;&#1492; signifies parentes (Chald., Vulg.); and &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; signifies not desiderium from &#1488;&#1493;&#1492;, but boundary from &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-7.htm">Numbers 34:7-8</a>,  equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;,   <a href="/1_samuel/21-14.htm">1 Samuel 21:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a>, to mark or bound off, as most of the Rabbins explain it. &#1506;&#1500; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; to be strong above, i.e., to surpass. The blessings which the patriarch implored for Joseph were to surpass the blessings which his parents transmitted to him, to the boundary of the everlasting hills, i.e., surpass them as far as the primary mountains tower above the earth, or so that they should reach to the summits of the primeval mountains. There is no allusion to the lofty and magnificent mountain-ranges of Ephraim, Bashan, and Gilead, which fell to the house of Joseph, either here or in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>. These blessings were to descend upon the head of Joseph, the &#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; among his brethren, i.e., "the separated one," from &#1504;&#1494;&#1512; separavit. Joseph is so designated, both here and <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-16.htm">Deuteronomy 33:16</a>, not on account of his virtue and the preservation of his chastity and piety in Egypt, but propter dignitatem, qua excellit, ab omnibus sit segregatus (Calv.), on account of the eminence to which he attained in Egypt. For this meaning see <a href="/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>; whereas no example can be found of the transference of the idea of Nasir to the sphere of morality. </body></html>
