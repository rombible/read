The character of Reuben is, that he was unstable as water. Men do not thrive, because they do not fix. Reuben's sin left a lasting infamy upon his family. Let us never do evil, then we need not fear being told of it. Simeon and Levi were passionate and revengeful. The murder of the Shechemites is a proof of this. Jacob protested against that barbarous act. Our soul is our honour; by its powers we are distinguished from, and raised above, the beasts that perish. We ought, from our hearts, to abhor all bloody and mischievous men. Cursed be their anger. Jacob does not curse their persons, but their lusts. I will divide them. The sentence as it respects Levi was turned into a blessing. This tribe performed an acceptable service in their zeal against the worshippers of the golden calf, Ex 32. Being set apart to God as priests, they were in that character scattered through the nation of Israel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Reuben, as the first-born by nature, has the first place in the benedictory address.

"The excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power" - the rank and authority which belong to the first-born. "Boiling over as water." That which boils over perishes at the same time that it is pernicious. This is here transferred in a figure to the passionate nature of Reuben. "Thou shalt not excel." There is here an allusion to the excellency of dignity and power. By the boiling over of his unhallowed passions Reuben lost all the excellence that primogeniture confers. By the dispensation of Providence the double portion went to Joseph, the first-born of Rachel; the chieftainship to Judah; and the priesthood to Levi. The cause of this forfeiture is then assigned. In the last sentence the patriarch in a spirit of indignant sorrow passes from the direct address to the indirect narrative. "To my couch he went up." The doom here pronounced upon Reuben is still a blessing, as he is not excluded from a tribe's share in the promised land. But, as in the case of the others, this blessing is abated and modified by his past conduct. His tribe has its seat on the east of the Jordan, and never comes to any eminence in the commonwealth of Israel.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 49:3, 4.

Because it is not probable that his fault should be described here in such general and ambiguous and dark terms, which is described so plainly and particularly in the following words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

Of Reuben’s excellent state to which he was born, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/49-3.htm" title="Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:">Genesis 49:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2.)

He repeats the same thing, and that in an emphatical manner, turning his speech and face from Reuben to his brethren, in a posture of indignation and detestation; which you must not impute to Jacob’s passion, he being now a dying man, and this being forty years after the crime committed, but to the Spirit of God guiding his tongue to utter this, not only nor chiefly for the punishment of Reuben, who, as many think, had repented of his sin; but for terror, instruction, and caution to all others, and to assure them that sin, though it may be long dissembled and borne with, yet it will one time or other be sorely punished. But these and the next foregoing words may be thus rendered, <span class="ital">Then defiledst thou my bed: he went up</span> to it, or rather, <span class="ital">he is gone up, </span> i.e. he is vanished, or perished, or lost; for so this word is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/job/5-26.htm" title="You shall come to your grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn comes in in his season.">Job 5:26</a> <a href="/isaiah/5-24.htm" title="Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 5:24</a> <a href="/jeremiah/48-15.htm" title="Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.">Jeremiah 48:15</a></span>.

And this may seem to be the truest translation and interpretation, because it keeps close to the Hebrew words and their order; whereas, in our translation, there is both a transplacing of the Hebrew words, and a supplement added unnecessarily. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/49.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Unstable as water,.... Which is not to be understood of the levity of his mind, and his disposition to hurt, and the impetuous force of that breaking forth like water, and carrying him into the commission of it; but rather of his fall from his excellency and dignity, like the fall of water from an high place; and of his being vile, mean, and contemptible, useless and unprofitable, like water spilled on the ground; and of his weak and strengthless condition and circumstances, being deprived of the prerogatives and privileges of his birthright, and having lost all his honour and grandeur, power and authority. The word in the Arabic language signifies (b) to be proud and haughty, to lift up one's self, to swell and rise like the turgent and swelling waters: but though he did thus lift himself, yet it follows: <p>thou shall not excel; not have the excellency of dignity and power which belonged to him as the firstborn; the birthright and the double portion were given to Joseph, who had two tribes descending from him, when Reuben had but one; the kingdom was given to Judah, and the priesthood to Levi, as both the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem observe: as he did not excel his brethren in honour and dignity, so neither in wealth and riches, nor in numbers; see <a href="/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a> where the word "not" is wrongly supplied; nor in his share in the land of Canaan, his posterity being seated on the other side of Jordan, at their request; nor did any persons of note and eminence spring from his tribe: because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, then defiledst thou it; referring to his incest with Bilhah, his father's concubine wife, <a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a> which, though done forty years ago, was now remembered, and left an indelible spot on Reuben's character, and his posterity: <p>he went up to my couch: turning himself to his other sons, to take notice of the crime, as very abominable and detestable; affirming the truth of it, and speaking of it with some vehemency, his affections being moved; and it may be could not bear to look at Reuben, but turned himself to his brethren; though he had forgiven the sin, and very probably Reuben had repented of it, and had forgiveness of God, which he might have, though in some sense vengeance was taken on this sinful invention of his, <a href="/psalms/99-8.htm">Psalm 99:8</a>. There are various senses given of this phrase; some, as Aben Ezra, "my bed departed from me"; that is, he departed from his bed; or, as Kimchi (c), "it ceased to be my bed"; he left it, he abstained from the bed of Bilhah upon its being defiled by Reuben: and others separate these words, and read  singly, "it went up" (d); either the excellency of Reuben went up, vanished and disappeared like smoke; or, as Ben Melech connects it with the beginning of the verse, "unstable as water", giving the sense, "it", the inundation of water, "ascended" and prevailed over thee; as waters ascend, meaning his lust ascended, and got the prevalence over him; but the accents will not admit of such a separation of the words; it is best to understand them in the first sense. As to the manner of the expression, of going up to a bed, it may be observed, that not only their beds in those times might be raised higher than ours, but that they were placed in an higher part of the room, and so there was an ascent to them: and Dr. Shaw (e) says this is the custom of the eastern people to this day,"at one end of each chamber there is a little gallery, raised three, four, or five feet above the floor, with a balustrade in the front of it, with a few steps likewise leading up to it, here they place their beds.'' <p>(b) "superbivit, semet extulit gloria fastuque", Golius, col. 1767. so Castel. col. 2980.

Reuben is as water without restraint pouring down in a foaming torrent. This is the thought of the renderings of LXX <span class="greekheb">ἐξύβρισας</span>; Lat. <span class="ital">effusus es</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou shalt not have</span>] Read as R.V. marg. the imperative of denunciation, <span class="ital">have not thou</span>.

In the Song of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-6.htm" title="Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>) the denunciation of Reuben is brief and stern, but unexplained; “let Reuben live, and not die; yet let his men be few.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is a possible conjecture that the legend (cf. <a href="/genesis/35-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Israel dwelled in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:">Genesis 35:22</a>) concerning Reuben embodied a cause of ancient Israelite prejudice against the Reubenites. Conceivably some marriage custom, like that of the heir receiving the concubines of his deceased father, may have been abandoned by the rest of Israel and been maintained by Reuben. (See Robertson Smith, <span class="ital">Kinship and Marriage</span>, p. 109, n. 2).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another conjecture is that Reuben, in some treacherous way, encroached upon the rights of the Bilhah clans, and in an isolated position wasted his strength in fierce and futile conflict with the neighbouring nomads.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/48.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Joseph observed his father placing his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, the younger son, he laid hold of it to put it upon Manasseh's head, telling his father at the same time that he was the first-born; but Jacob replied, "I know, my son, I:know: he also (Manasseh) will become a nation, and will become great, yet (&#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501; as in <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>) his younger brother will become greater than he, and his seed will become the fulness of nations." This blessing began to be fulfilled from the time of the Judges, when the tribe of Ephraim so increased in extent and power, that it took the lead of the northern tribes and became the head of the ten tribes, and its name acquired equal importance with the name Israel, whereas under Moses, Manasseh had numbered 20,000 more than Ephraim (<a href="/numbers/26-34.htm">Numbers 26:34</a> and <a href="/numbers/26-37.htm">Numbers 26:37</a>). As a result of the promises received from God, the blessing was not merely a pious wish, but the actual bestowal of a blessing of prophetic significance and force. - In <a href="/genesis/48-20.htm">Genesis 48:20</a> the writer sums up the entire act of blessing in the words of the patriarch: "In thee (i.e., Joseph) will Israel (as a nation) bless, saying: God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh" (i.e., Joseph shall be so blessed in his two sons, that their blessing will become a standing form of benediction in Israel); "and thus he placed Ephraim before Manasseh," viz., in the position of his hands and the terms of the blessing. Lastly, (<a href="/genesis/48-21.htm">Genesis 48:21</a>) Israel expressed to Joseph his firm faith in the promise, that God would bring back his descendants after his death into the land of their fathers (Canaan), and assigned to him a double portion in the promised land, the conquest of which passed before his prophetic glance as already accomplished, in order to insure for the future the inheritance of the adopted sons of Joseph. "I give thee one ridge of land above thy brethren" (i.e., above what thy brethren receive, each as a single tribe), "which I take from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow" (i.e., by force of arms). As the perfect is used prophetically, transposing the future to the present as being already accomplished, so the words &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; must also be understood prophetically, as denoting that Jacob would wrest the land from the Amorites, not in his own person, but in that of his posterity.<p>(Note: There is no force in Kurtz's objection, that this gift did not apply to Joseph as the father of Ephraim and Manasseh, but to Joseph personally; for it rests upon the erroneous assumption, that Jacob separated Joseph from his sons by their adoption. But there is not a word to that effect in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/48-6.htm">Genesis 48:6</a>, and the very opposite in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>, viz., that Jacob blessed Joseph in Ephraim and Manasseh. Heim's conjecture, which Kurtz approves, that by the land given to Joseph we are to understand the high land of Gilead, which Jacob had conquered from the Amorites, needs no refutation, for it is purely imaginary.)<p>The words cannot refer to the purchase of the piece of ground at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>), for a purchase could not possibly be called a conquest by sword and bow; and still less to the crime committed by the sons of Jacob against the inhabitants of Shechem, when they plundered the town (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>.), for Jacob could not possibly have attributed to himself a deed for which he had pronounced a curse upon Simeon and Levi (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6-7</a>), not to mention the fact, that the plundering of Shechem was not followed in this instance by the possession of the city, but by the removal of Jacob from the neighbourhood. "Moreover, any conquest of territory would have been entirely at variance with the character of the patriarchal history, which consisted in the renunciation of all reliance upon human power, and a believing, devoted trust in the God of the promises" (Delitzsch). The land, which the patriarchs desired to obtain in Canaan, they procured not by force of arms, but by legal purchase (cf. <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a> and <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>). It was to be very different in the future, when the iniquity of the Amorites was full (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). But Jacob called the inheritance, which Joseph was to have in excess of his brethren, &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501; (lit., shoulder, or more properly nape, neck; here figuratively a ridge, or tract of land), as a play upon the word Shechem, because he regarded the piece of land purchased at Shechem as a pledge of the future possession of the whole land. In the piece purchased there, the bones of Joseph were buried, after the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>); and this was understood in future times, as though Jacob had presented the piece of ground to Joseph (vid., <a href="/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>). </body></html>
