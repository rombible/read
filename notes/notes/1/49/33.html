He spoke about his burial-place, from a principle of faith in the promise of God, that Canaan should be the inheritance of his seed in due time. When he had finished both his blessing and his charge, and so had finished his testimony, he addressed himself to his dying work. He gathered up his feet into the bed, not only as one patiently submitting to the stroke, but as one cheerfully composing himself to rest, now that he was weary. He freely gave up his spirit into the hand of God, the Father of spirits. If God's people be our people, death will gather us to them. Under the care of the Shepherd of Israel, we shall lack nothing for body or soul. We shall remain unmoved until our work is finished; then, breathing out our souls into His hands for whose salvation we have waited, we shall depart in peace, and leave a blessing for our children after us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After the benediction Jacob gives directions concerning his burial. "All these are the twelve tribes". This implies that the benedictions refer not to the heads only, but to the whole tribes. "Each according to his blessing." All are blessed, but the form of the blessing is suited to the character of the individual "Bury me with my fathers" - with Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Leah. This dying command he now lays on the twelve, as he had before bound Joseph by oath to its performance. "Gathered up his feet into the bed." He had been sitting upright while pronouncing the benedictory address and giving his last directions. He now lies down and calmly breathes his last. <p> - The Burial of Jacob<p>10. &#1488;&#1496;&#1491;  'a&#772;t&#803;a&#770;d Atad, "the buck-thorn."<p>11. &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1500;  'a&#772;be&#770;l-m&#305;&#770;tsray&#305;&#770;m, Abel-Mitsraim, "mourning of Mizraim," or meadow of Mizraim.<p>This chapter records the burial of Jacob and the death of Joseph, and so completes the history of the chosen family, and the third bible for the instruction of man.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons&#8212;It is probable that he was supernaturally strengthened for this last momentous office of the patriarch, and that when the divine afflatus ceased, his exhausted powers giving way, he yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Commanding his sons, </span> to wit, concerning the place of his burial.
