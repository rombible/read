And thus he brings back “goodly words”—Heb., <span class= "ital">words of pleasure</span>—that is, trustworthy intelligence to guide the army in its motions. Another translation has been proposed, which has the support of the LXX.: “Naphtali is a spreading terebinth, which shoots forth goodly branches.” It retains the consonants of the Hebrew text, but gives them different vowels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/49.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/49-21.htm" title="Naphtali is a hind let loose: he gives goodly words.">Genesis 49:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Naphtali is a hind let loose — </span>Those of this tribe were, as the <span class="ital">loosened </span>hind, zealous for their liberty, and yet affable and courteous, their language refined, and they complaisant, <span class="ital">giving goodly words. </span>Among God’s <span class="ital">Israel </span>there is to be found a great <span class="ital">variety </span>of dispositions, yet all contributing to the beauty and strength of the body.

The cause of God and his people, though for a time it may seem to be baffled and run down, will be victorious at last. It represents the Christian's conflict. Grace in the soul is often foiled in its conflicts; troops of corruption overcome it, but the cause is God's, and grace will in the end come off conqueror, yea, more than conqueror, Ro 8:37. Asher should be a rich tribe. His inheritance bordered upon Carmel, which was fruitful to a proverb. Naphtali, is a hind let loose. We may consider it as a description of the character of this tribe. Unlike the laborious ox and ass; desirous of ease and liberty; active, but more noted for quick despatch than steady labour and perseverance. Like the suppliant who, with goodly words, craves mercy. Let not those of different tempers and gifts censure or envy one another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Naphtali is a hind let loose. The hind or "gazelle" is agile and nimble. When free on its native hills, it roams with instinctive confidence and delight. It is timid and irresolute in confinement. This is probably the character of Naphtali. "He giveth goodly words." Here we pass from the figure to the reality. Eloquence in prose and verse was characteristic of this particular tribe. The only important historical event in which they are concerned is the defeat of Jabin's host, which is celebrated in the song of Deborah and Barak <a href="/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>. In this passage we may study the character of the tribe.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 49:21. Naphtali&#8212;The best rendering we know is this, "Naphtali is a deer roaming at liberty; he shooteth forth goodly branches," or majestic antlers [Taylor, Scripture Illustrations], and the meaning of the prophecy seems to be that the tribe of Naphtali would be located in a territory so fertile and peaceable, that, feeding on the richest pasture, he would spread out, like a deer, branching antlers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A hind let loose; </span> not pursued by hunters, nor shut up in some little enclosure, but wholly left to its own freedom, to feed upon the best pastures: see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.htm" title="And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess you the west and the south.">Deu 33:23</a></span>. Or, free from the yoke which they, together with the other tribes, did bear in Egypt; free from its former restraints, which make it run away more swiftly. So it may note their nimbleness and expedition, either in encountering enemies, or in avoiding dangers. See <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/4-6.htm" title="And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?">Judges 4:6</a>,10 5:18</span>. Or, like a tame hind left to its liberty, in which the owner takes delight, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/proverbs/5-19.htm" title="Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.">Proverbs 5:19</a></span>; for he seems to be commended rather for arts of peace than war. And this may note, that his temper and Conversation was civil, obliging, and amiable; which sense the next words favour. His speeches and discourses with others are fair, and friendly, and winning. It is not strange that this tribe was generally of a sweeter disposition than others, seeing it is commonly observed that there is a great difference in the tempers of people of divers provinces or cities bordering one upon another. But this verse may be otherwise rendered according to the opinion of a late learned writer: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Naphtali</span> is <span class="ital">a tree</span> (so the Hebrew word signifies, only <span class="ital">jod</span> is inserted here, as it is in the same word, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/isaiah/1-29.htm" title="For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.">Isaiah 1:29</a> 61:3</span>) <span class="ital">shot forth, </span> or <span class="ital">spread forth, </span>( into many branches; for the Hebrew verb <span class="ital">shalach</span> is oft used concerning trees, and their shooting forth of branches, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/psalms/80-11.htm" title="She sent out her boughs to the sea, and her branches to the river.">Psalm 80:11</a> <a href="/ezekiel/17-6.htm" title="And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.">Ezekiel 17:6</a> 31:5</span>) <span class="ital">sending forth goodly branches; </span> the word <span class="ital">imre, </span> which is by others rendered <span class="ital">words, </span> here signifying <span class="ital">branches, </span> as either the same word, or one coming from the same root, and consisting of the same radical letters, is taken <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/isaiah/17-6.htm" title="Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, said the LORD God of Israel.">Isaiah 17:6</a>,9</span>. And it is usual in the Hebrew language for two words coming from the same root to exchange their significations. And this interpretation is favoured by the ancient interpreters, the LXX., and one of the Arabic manuscripts, which make <span class="ital">Naphtali</span> here to be compared to a goodly tree bringing forth excellent fruit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/49.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Naphtali is a hind let loose,.... Onkelos applies it to the tribe itself, and to the goodness of its land,"as for Naphtali, his lot fell in a good land, and his inheritance a fruit bearing one,''as it was; for in it was the most fruitful country of Gennesaret, which gave name to a sea or lake by it, and which abounded with gardens, with palm trees, fig trees, and olive trees; and which, Josephus says (n) one might call the ambition of nature; and Strabo (o), an Heathen writer, says of it, that it was an happy blessed country, and bearing all sorts of good things; and Jarchi on the place observes, this is the vale of Gennesaret, which is as quick to bring forth fruit, as a hind is swift to run. Some will have this prophecy to be fulfilled in Barak, as Ben Gersom, Abendana, and others, who was of this tribe, and who at first was fearful like the hind, and backward to go out to war when called, but afterwards readily went out with Deborah, and at last gave goodly words in the song they both sung: but it better describes the genius, disposition, and manners of the tribe, who were kind and loving, swift and expeditious in their affairs; lovers of liberty, well spoken persons, humane, affable, courteous, of a good address and pleasing language, as follows: <p>he giveth goodly words; to those he converses with; and it may be applied, particularly to Christ and his disciples, and to the inhabitants of this tribe in his time, among whom they much were, see <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a> he himself is compared to the hind of the morning, <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a> in the title, and to a roe or a young hart, Sol 2:9 Sol 8:14 for his amiableness and loveliness in himself, and for his lovingness to his people, and for his swiftness to do the will and work of his father, being sent out (p), as the word here used signifies, by him into this world, on the business of man's salvation: and so his disciples, who were Galilaeans, were swift to obey his call, and left all and followed him, and were sent out by him to preach his Gospel; and both he and they may be said to "give goodly words", as the doctrines of the Gospel are, words of grace, truth, and life; wholesome, comfortable, pleasant and delightful; good tidings of good things, of peace, pardon, righteousness, salvation and eternal life by Christ: and the inhabitants of this country in Christ's time were swift to run after him, and hear him; panted after him as the hart after the water brooks, and both received and gave out the goodly words of the Gospel, and were made free thereby, and so like an hind let loose. Bochart gives a different version of these words, which is countenanced by the Septuagint version, Naphtali is a tree full of shoots, or "a tree shot out, sprouting out beautiful branches"; but as this is contrary to the points, and coincides with the next verse, it is rejected by many learned men. <p>(n) De Bello Jud. l. 3. c. 9. sect. 3.((o) Geograph. l. 16. p. 519.

On the other hand, Joseph is compared to a vine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a hind let loose</span>] Lat. <span class="ital">cervus emissus</span>, an image of swiftness and grace in movement, associated with the thought of open and extensive country.

The rendering “goodly lambs” is suggested, but the translation “lambs” cannot be supported from the O.T., and gives, at the best, a very prosaic sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By a different vocalization an entirely different turn is given to the verse. “Naphtali is a tall shoot of terebinth, one that putteth forth goodly topmost branches.” “Topmost branches” would then be metaphorical for “leaders” like Barak (<a href="/judges/4-5.htm" title="And she dwelled under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.">Jdg 4:5</a>), but this rendering is very questionable; though it may explain LXX <span class="greekheb">Νεφθαλεὶ στέλεχος ἀνειμένον ἐπιδιδοὺς ἐν τῷ γεννήματι κάλλος</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Naphtaii is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</span> The LXX., followed by Dathe, Michaelis, Ewald, Bohlen, and others, read, Naphtali is a tall terebinth, that putteth forth beautiful boughs; but the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> signifies a hind or gazelle, and is here employed, along with the qualifying epithet <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5bb;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, let loose, running freely (Keil), or graceful (Kalisch), to depict Naphtali as a beautiful and agile warrior. In the appended clause he is represented as possessing in addition the capacity of "giving words of beauty," in which may be detected an allusion to the development in eloquence and song which afterwards took place in that northern tribe (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6-9</a>; <a href="/judges/5-1.htm">Judges 5:1-31</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Issachar is a bony ass, lying between the hurdles. He saw that rest was a good (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; subst.), and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute." The foundation of this award also lies in the name &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, which is probably interpreted with reference to the character of Issachar, and with an allusion to the relation between &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;, a daily labourer, as an indication of the character and fate of his tribe. "Ease at the cost of liberty will be the characteristic of the tribe of Issachar" (Delitzsch). The simile of a bony, i.e., strongly-built ass, particularly adapted for carrying burdens, pointed to the fact that this tribe would content itself with material good, devote itself to the labour and burden of agriculture, and not strive after political power and rule. The figure also indicated "that Issachar would become a robust, powerful race of men, and receive a pleasant inheritance which would invite to comfortable repose." (According to Jos. de bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.3, 2, Lower Galilee, with the fruitful table land of Jezreel, was attractive even to &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;). Hence, even if the simile of a bony ass contained nothing contemptible, it did not contribute to Issachar's glory. Like an idle beast of burden, he would rather submit to the yoke and be forced to do the work of a slave, than risk his possessions and his peace in the struggle for liberty. To bend the shoulder to the yoke, to come down to carrying burdens and become a mere serf, was unworthy of Israel, the nation of God that was called to rule, however it might befit its foes, especially the Canaanites upon whom the curse of slavery rested (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-11.htm">Deuteronomy 20:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>). This was probably also the reason why Issachar was noticed last among the sons of Leah. In the time of the Judges, however, Issachar acquired renown for heroic bravery in connection with Zebulun (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14-15</a>, <a href="/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>). The sons of Leah are followed by the four sons of the two maids, arranged, not according to their mothers or their ages, but according to the blessing pronounced upon them, so that the two warlike tribes stand first. </body></html>
