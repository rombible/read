It is now to have another justification in the noble history of his race, which, taking the foremost place by reason of the disqualification of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, finally was destined to win freedom and empire for Israel. We have seen that “the excellency of power” ought to have belonged to Reuben; it now falls to Judah’s lot, is to be attained by exploits that shall deserve the praise of all the tribes, and is to be exercised over not only the descendants of Leah, but all Jacob’s children.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/49.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/49-8.htm" title="Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise: your hand shall be in the neck of your enemies; your father's children shall bow down before you.">Genesis 49:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise — </span>As thy name signifies <span class="ital">praise, </span>and God was praised for thee, (<a href="/genesis/29-35.htm" title="And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.">Genesis 29:35</a>,) and shall be praised by and in thee, so shalt thou have praise and honour from thy brethren. The tribe of Judah led the van through the wilderness, <a href="/numbers/10-14.htm" title="In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.">Numbers 10:14</a>, and, in the conquest of Canaan, by the appointment of God, went first up against the Canaanites, after the death of Joshua, <a href="/context/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?...">Jdg 1:1-2</a>. They had the first lot assigned them in the division of the country, and a lot that was very extensive and fertile. Othniel, the first judge, was of this tribe; and Caleb, whose reputation was not much inferior to that of Joshua. And all the kings that ever God granted the Jewish nation <span class="ital">in mercy </span>were of them. In short, in every age, this tribe was more honoured than any of the others. <span class="ital">Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies — </span>An expression which signified victory over their enemies, and was remarkably fulfilled in David, <a href="/psalms/18-40.htm" title="You have also given me the necks of my enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.">Psalm 18:40</a>. <span class="ital">Thy father’s children shall bow down before thee — </span>They shall not only acknowledge thy dignity above that of the other tribes, and pay such honour to thee as is wont to be conferred on the firstborn; but shall submit to the regal authority and power which shall be vested in thee. This was verified in God’s choosing the tribe of Judah, and David out of it, to govern the Hebrew nation, and in settling the kingdom of Israel in his stock for ever; but especially in the Messiah’s being born of this tribe, whose kingdom is everlasting, and <span class="ital">to whom every knee shall bow.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>49:8-12 Judah's name signifies praise. God was praised for him, chap. 29:35, praised by him, and praised in him; therefore his brethren shall praise him. Judah should be a strong and courageous tribe. Judah is compared, not to a lion raging and ranging, but to a lion enjoying the satisfaction of his power and success, without creating vexation to others; this is to be truly great. Judah should be the royal tribe, the tribe from which Messiah the Prince should come. Shiloh, that promised Seed in whom the earth should be blessed, that peaceable and prosperous One, or Saviour, he shall come of Judah. Thus dying Jacob at a great distance saw Christ's day, and it was his comfort and support on his death-bed. Till Christ's coming, Judah possessed authority, but after his crucifixion this was shortened, and according to what Christ foretold, Jerusalem was destroyed, and all the poor harassed remnant of Jews were confounded together. Much which is here said concerning Judah, is to be applied to our Lord Jesus. In him there is plenty of all which is nourishing and refreshing to the soul, and which maintains and cheers the Divine life in it. He is the true Vine; wine is the appointed symbol of his blood, which is drink indeed, as shed for sinners, and applied in faith; and all the blessings of his gospel are wine and milk, without money and without price, to which every thirsty soul is welcome. Isa 55:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/49.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Judah, the fourth son of Jacob, comes in for the supremacy after the three former have been set aside. His personal prowess, the perpetuity of his dominion, and the luxuriance of his soil are then described. "Thee shall thy brethren praise." This is an allusion to his name, which signifies praise <a href="/genesis/29-35.htm">Genesis 29:35</a>. As his mother praised the Lord for her fourth son, so shall his brethren praise him for his personal excellence. Ardor of temperament, decision of character, and frankness of acknowledgment are conspicuous even in the blemishes of his early life. Tenderness of conscience, promptitude in resolve, capacity for business, and force of eloquence come out in his riper years. These are qualities that win popular esteem. "Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies." They shall flee before him, but shall not escape his powerful grasp. They shall be compelled to yield to his overwhelming power. "Thy father's sons shall bow down to thee." Not only his enemies, but his friends, shall acknowledge his sway. The similar prediction concerning Joseph <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/37-6.htm">Genesis 37:6-8</a> was of a personal nature, and referred to a special occasion, not to a permanent state of affairs. It had already received its main fulfillment, and would altogether terminate with the lifetime of Joseph. The present announcement refers to Judah not as an individual, but as the head of a tribe in Israel, and will therefore, correspond in duration with that commonwealth.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/49.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ge 49:8-12.

Not only would Judah s soil be so fertile that its vines should be employed for trying asses and colts to their branches, but the grapes of those vines should be so plentiful and luscious as to make wine run like the water in which he washed his clothes, while the wine and milk should be so exhilarating and invigorating as to imp-art a sparkling brilliance to the eyes and a charming whiteness to the teeth. The aged prophet, it has been appropriately remarked, has here no thought of debauchery, but only paints before the mind's eye a picture of the richest and most ornate enjoyment (Lange). <span class="accented">Minime consentaneum esse videtur profusam intemperiem et projectionem in benedictione censeri</span> (Calvin). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/49.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Blessing. - <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>, <a href="/genesis/49-2.htm">Genesis 49:2</a>. When Jacob had adopted and blessed the two sons of Joseph, he called his twelve sons, to make known to them his spiritual bequest. In an elevated and solemn tone he said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you (&#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; for &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492;, as in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/42-4.htm">Genesis 42:4</a>, <a href="/genesis/42-38.htm">Genesis 42:38</a>) at the end of the days! Gather yourselves together and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and hearken unto Israel your father!" The last address of Jacob-Israel to his twelve sons, which these words introduce, is designated by the historian (<a href="/genesis/49-28.htm">Genesis 49:28</a>) "the blessing," with which "their father blessed them, every one according to his blessing." This blessing is at the same time a prophecy. "Every superior and significant life becomes prophetic at its close" (Ziegler). But this was especially the case with the lives of the patriarchs, which were filled and sustained by the promises and revelations of God. As Isaac in his blessing (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>) pointed out prophetically to his two sons, by virtue of divine illumination, the future history of their families; "so Jacob, while blessing the twelve, pictured in grand outlines the lineamenta of the future history of the future nation" (Ziegler). The groundwork of his prophecy was supplied partly by the natural character of his twelve sons, and partly by the divine promise which had been given by the Lord to him and to his fathers Abraham and Isaac, and that not merely in these two points, the numerous increase of their seed and the possession of Canaan, but in its entire scope, by which Israel had been appointed to be the recipient and medium of salvation for all nations. On this foundation the Spirit of God revealed to the dying patriarch Israel the future history of his seed, so that he discerned in the characters of his sons the future development of the tribes proceeding from them, and with prophetic clearness assigned to each of them its position and importance in the nation into which they were to expand in the promised inheritance. Thus he predicted to the sons what would happen to them "in the last days," lit., "at the end of the days" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, lxx), and not merely at some future time. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, the opposite of &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;, signifies the end in contrast with the beginning (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>); hence &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; in prophetic language denoted, not the future generally, but the last future (see Hengstenberg's History of Balaam, pp. 465-467, transl.), the Messianic age of consummation (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-8.htm">Ezekiel 38:8</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-24.htm">Jeremiah 30:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-39.htm">Jeremiah 49:39</a>, etc.: so also <a href="/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>), like &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (<a href="/2_peter/3-3.htm">2 Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), or &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>). But we must not restrict "the end of the days" to the extreme point of the time of completion of the Messianic kingdom; it embraces "the whole history of the completion which underlies the present period of growth," or "the future as bringing the work of God to its ultimate completion, though modified according to the particular stage to which the work of God had advanced in any particular age, the range of vision opened to that age, and the consequent horizon of the prophet, which, though not absolutely dependent upon it, was to a certain extent regulated by it" (Delitzsch).<p>For the patriarch, who, with his pilgrim-life, had been obliged in the very evening of his days to leave the soil of the promised land and seek a refuge for himself and his house in Egypt, the final future, with its realization of the promises of God, commenced as soon as the promised land was in the possession of the twelve tribes descended from his sons. He had already before his eyes, in his twelve sons with their children and children's children, the first beginnings of the multiplication of his seed into a great nation. Moreover, on his departure from Canaan he had received the promise, that the God of his fathers would make him into a great nation, and lead him up again to Canaan (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3-4</a>). The fulfilment of this promise his thoughts and hopes, his longings and wishes, were all directed. This constituted the firm foundation, though by no means the sole and exclusive purport, of his words of blessing. The fact was not, as Baumgarten and Kurtz suppose, that Jacob regarded the time of Joshua as that of the completion; that for him the end was nothing more than the possession of the promised land by his seed as the promised nation, so that all the promises pointed to this, and nothing beyond it was either affirmed or hinted at. Not a single utterance announces the capture of the promised land; not a single one points specially to the time of Joshua. On the contrary, Jacob presupposes not only the increase of his sons into powerful tribes, but also the conquest of Canaan, as already fulfilled; foretells to his sons, whom he sees in spirit as populous tribes, growth and prosperity on the soil in their possession; and dilates upon their relation to one another in Canaan and to the nations round about, even to the time of their final subjection to the peaceful sway of Him, from whom the sceptre of Judah shall never depart. The ultimate future of the patriarchal blessing, therefore, extends to the ultimate fulfilment of the divine promises-that is to say, to the completion of the kingdom of God. The enlightened seer's-eye of the patriarch surveyed, "as though upon a canvas painted without perspective," the entire development of Israel from its first foundation as the nation and kingdom of God till its completion under the rule of the Prince of Peace, whom the nations would serve in willing obedience; and beheld the twelve tribes spreading themselves out, each in his inheritance, successfully resisting their enemies, and finding rest and full satisfaction in the enjoyment of the blessings of Canaan.<p>It is in this vision of the future condition of his sons as grown into tribes that the prophetic character of the blessing consists; not in the prediction of particular historical events, all of which, on the contrary, with the exception of the prophecy of Shiloh, fall into the background behind the purely ideal portraiture of the peculiarities of the different tribes. The blessing gives, in short sayings full of bold and thoroughly original pictures, only general outlines of a prophetic character, which are to receive their definite concrete form from the historical development of the tribes in the future; and throughout it possesses both in form and substance a certain antique stamp, in which its genuineness is unmistakeably apparent. Every attack upon its genuineness has really proceeded from an a priori denial of all supernatural prophecies, and has been sustained by such misinterpretations as the introduction of special historical allusions, for the purpose of stamping it as a vaticinia ex eventu, and by other untenable assertions and assumptions; such, for example, as that people do not make poetry at so advanced an age or in the immediate prospect of death, or that the transmission of such an oration word for word down to the time of Moses is utterly inconceivable-objections the emptiness of which has been demonstrated in Hengstenberg's Christology i. p. 76 (transl.) by copious citations from the history of the early Arabic poetry. </body></html>
