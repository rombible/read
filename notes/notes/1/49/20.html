Grace in the soul is often foiled in its conflicts; troops of corruption overcome it, but the cause is God's, and grace will in the end come off conqueror, yea, more than conqueror, Ro 8:37. Asher should be a rich tribe. His inheritance bordered upon Carmel, which was fruitful to a proverb. Naphtali, is a hind let loose. We may consider it as a description of the character of this tribe. Unlike the laborious ox and ass; desirous of ease and liberty; active, but more noted for quick despatch than steady labour and perseverance. Like the suppliant who, with goodly words, craves mercy.

He saw that rest was a good (&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; subst.), and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute." The foundation of this award also lies in the name &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;, which is probably interpreted with reference to the character of Issachar, and with an allusion to the relation between &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512; and &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;, a daily labourer, as an indication of the character and fate of his tribe. "Ease at the cost of liberty will be the characteristic of the tribe of Issachar" (Delitzsch). The simile of a bony, i.e., strongly-built ass, particularly adapted for carrying burdens, pointed to the fact that this tribe would content itself with material good, devote itself to the labour and burden of agriculture, and not strive after political power and rule. The figure also indicated "that Issachar would become a robust, powerful race of men, and receive a pleasant inheritance which would invite to comfortable repose." (According to Jos. de bell. <a href="//biblehub.com/jude/3.htm">Jude 3</a>.3, 2, Lower Galilee, with the fruitful table land of Jezreel, was attractive even to &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;). Hence, even if the simile of a bony ass contained nothing contemptible, it did not contribute to Issachar's glory. Like an idle beast of burden, he would rather submit to the yoke and be forced to do the work of a slave, than risk his possessions and his peace in the struggle for liberty. To bend the shoulder to the yoke, to come down to carrying burdens and become a mere serf, was unworthy of Israel, the nation of God that was called to rule, however it might befit its foes, especially the Canaanites upon whom the curse of slavery rested (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-11.htm">Deuteronomy 20:11</a>; <a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>). This was probably also the reason why Issachar was noticed last among the sons of Leah. In the time of the Judges, however, Issachar acquired renown for heroic bravery in connection with Zebulun (<a href="//biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14-15</a>, <a href="/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>). The sons of Leah are followed by the four sons of the two maids, arranged, not according to their mothers or their ages, but according to the blessing pronounced upon them, so that the two warlike tribes stand first. </body></html>
