Jacob and Esau were prayed for; their parents, after being long childless, obtained them by prayer. The fulfilment of God's promise is always sure, yet it is often slow. The faith of believers is tried, their patience exercised, and mercies long waited for are more welcome when they come. Isaac and Rebekah kept in view the promise of all nations being blessed in their posterity, therefore were not only desirous of children, but anxious concerning every thing which seemed to mark their future character. In all our doubts we should inquire of the Lord by prayer. In many of our conflicts with sin and temptation, we may adopt Rebekah's words, If it be so, why am I thus? If a child of God, why so careless or carnal? If not a child of God, why so afraid of, or so burdened with sin?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The twins are born in due time. The difference is manifest in the outward appearance. The first is red and hairy. These qualities indicate a passionate and precocious nature. He is called "Esau the hairy," or "the made up," the prematurely developed. His brother is like other children. An act takes place in the very birth foreshadowing their future history. The second has a hold of his brother's heel, as if he would trip him up from his very birth. Hence, he is called "Jacob the wrestler," who takes hold by the heel.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife&#8212;Though tried in a similar way to his father, he did not follow the same crooked policy. Twenty years he continued unblessed with offspring, whose seed was to be "as the stars" [Ge 26:4]. But in answer to their mutual prayers (1Pe 3:7), Rebekah was divinely informed that she was to be the mother of twins, who should be the progenitors of two independent nations; that the descendants of the younger should be the more powerful and subdue those of the other (Ro 9:12; 2Ch 21:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled,.... The nine months were up from the time of her conception; or, as the Targum of Jonathan, when the two hundred and seventy days she went with child were completed: <p>behold, there were twins in her womb; as was perceived by the midwife; a double mercy was granted, more given than asked for; probably only one child was asked for, but two given. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">and were fulfilled her days to bring forth</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.; cf. <a href="/luke/1-57.htm">Luke 1:57</a>; <a href="/luke/2-6.htm">Luke 2:6</a>). Jarchi accounts for the different phrase used of Thamar (<a href="/genesis/38-27.htm">Genesis 38:27</a>), who also bore twins, by supposing that she had not completed her days, but gave birth to Pharez and Zarah in the seventh month (<span class="accented">vide</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">in loco</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="cmt_word">behold, there were twins in her womb</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/38-27.htm">Genesis 38:27</a>, where the full form of the word for twins is given). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ishmael died at the age of 137, and his descendants dwelt in Havilah - i.e., according to <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a>, the country of the Chaulotaeans, on the borders of Arabia Petraea and Felix - as far as Shur (the desert of Jifar, <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>) to the east of Egypt, "in the direction of Assyria." Havilah and Shur therefore formed the south-eastern and south-western boundaries of the territories of the Ishmaelites, from which they extended their nomadic excursions towards the N.E. as far as the districts under Assyrian rule, i.e., to the lands of the Euphrates, traversing the whole of the desert of Arabia, or (as Josephus says, Ant. i. 12, 4) dwelling from the Euphrates to the Red Sea.
