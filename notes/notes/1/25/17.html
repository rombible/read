See note on “Havilah,” <a href="/genesis/10-29.htm" title="And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.">Genesis 10:29</a>. It was apparently a locality in the N.E. of Arabia. On “Shur,” see note on <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.">Genesis 16:7</a>. It was on the eastern border of Egypt. It has been conjectured that this summary description of Ishmael’s territory concluded J’s narrative of Hagar and Ishmael (<a href="/context/genesis/16-1.htm" title="Now Sarai Abram's wife bore him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar....">Genesis 16:1-14</a>). It seems to indicate the whole extent of country between N.E. Arabia and the E. Egyptian frontier.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before Egypt</span>] The preposition “before,” i.e. “in front of,” denotes “the eastern side.” See note on <a href="/genesis/16-12.htm" title="And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers.">Genesis 16:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as thou goest … Assyria</span>] The mention of “Assyria” is here evidently quite out of place, and the explanation of Delitzsch that it means “up to, or as far as, the country under the rule of Assyria,” is very forced and improbable. Either, therefore, the Asshur here mentioned is to be connected with the country of the “Asshurim” (<span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/25-3.htm" title="And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.">Genesis 25:3</a></span>), or we must suppose that the text has suffered some corruption.

The blessing of Isaac is traced to Elohim, not to Jehovah; because it referred neither exclusively nor pre-eminently to the gifts of grace connected with the promises of salvation, but quite generally to the inheritance of earthly possessions, which Isaac had received from his father. </body></html>
