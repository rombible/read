There is no regret, no sad feeling that he had prolonged his life at too high a cost. And if Jacob is cunning, and mean in the advantage he took of his brother, still he valued these privileges, and in the sequel he had his reward and his punishment. He was confirmed in the possession of the birthright, and became the progenitor of the chosen race, and of the Messiah; but henceforward his life was full of danger and difficulty. He had to flee from his brother’s enmity, and was perpetually the victim of fraud and the most cruel deceit. But gradually his character ripened for good. He ceased to be a scheming, worldly-minded Jacob, and became an Israel, and in his pious old age we see a man full of trust and faith in God, unworldly and unselfish, and animated by tender and loving feeling. Purified from his early infirmities, and with all his better nature strengthened and sanctified by sorrow, he shows himself worthy of his second name, and becomes “a prince with God.”<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/maclaren/genesis/25.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Genesis<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A BAD BARGAIN<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">POTTAGE VERSUS BIRTHRIGHT<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/25-34.htm" title="Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.">Genesis 25:34</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Broad lessons unmistakable, but points strange and difficult to throw oneself back to so different a set of ideas.

All the loftier aspects gone from Isaac, who thought he could give it for venison, from Esau, and from the scheming Rebekah and the crafty Jacob.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">b</span>} The Bargain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is not clear whether the transaction was seriously meant, or whether it only shows Jacob’s wish to possess the birthright and Esau’s indifference to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> At any rate, the barter was not supposed to complete Jacob’s title, as is shown by a subsequent piece of trickery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Isaac’s blessing was conceived to confer it; that blessing, if once given, could not be revoked, even if procured by fraud and given in error.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The belief would fulfil itself, as far as the chieftainship was concerned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is significant of the purely ‘secular’ tone of all the parties concerned that only temporal blessings are included in Isaac’s words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">c</span>} The Scripture judgment on all parties concerned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Great mistakes are made by forgetting that the Bible is a passionless narrator of its heroes’ acts, and seldom pauses to censure or praise-so people have thought that Scripture gave its vote for Jacob as against Esau.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The character of the two men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Esau-frank, impulsive, generous, chivalrous, careless, and sensuous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Jacob-meditative, reflective, pastoral, timid, crafty, selfish.

Broad General Lessons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>1. The Choice.-Birthright <span class="ital">versus</span> Pottage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">a</span>} The Present <span class="ital">versus</span> The Future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Suppose it true that to both brothers the birthright seemed to secure merely material advantage, yet even so the better part would have been to sacrifice material present for material future. Even on plane of worldly things, to live for to-morrow ennobles a man, and he is the higher style of man who ‘spurns delights and lives laborious days’ for some issue to be realised in the far future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The very same principle extended leads to the conviction that the highest wisdom is his who lives for the furthest, which is also the most certain, Future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> {<span class="ital">b</span>} The Seen <span class="ital">versus</span> The Unseen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> However material the advantages of the birthright were supposed to be, they <span class="ital">then</span> appealed to imagination, not sense. <span class="ital">There</span> was the pottage in the pan: ‘I can see that and smell it. This birthright, can I eat <span class="ital">it</span>? Let me get the solid realities, and let who will have the imaginary.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So the unseen good things, such as intellectual culture, fair reputation, and the like, are better than the gross satisfactions that can be handled, or tasted, or seen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And, on the very same principle, high above the seeker after these-as high as he is above the drunkard-is the Christian, whose life is shaped by the loftiest Unseen, even ‘Him who is invisible.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 2. The grim absurdity of the choice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The story seems to have a certain undertone of sarcasm, and a keen perception of the immense stupidity of the man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Pottage and a full belly to-day-that was all he got for such a sacrifice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘This their way is their folly.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 3. How well the bargain worked at first, and what came of it at last.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No doubt Esau had his meal, and, no doubt, when a man sells his soul to the devil {the mediaeval form of the story}, he generally gets the price for which he bargained, more or less, and oftentimes with a dash of vinegar in the porridge, which makes it less palatable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What comes of it at last. Put side by side the pictures of Esau’s animal contentment at the moment when he had eaten up his mess, and of his despair when he wailed, ‘Hast thou not one blessing?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He finds out his mistake. A sense of the preciousness of the despised thing wakes in him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And it is too late. There <span class="ital">are</span> irrevocable consequences of every false choice. Youth is gone: cannot alter that. Opportunities gone: cannot alter that. Strength gone: cannot alter that. Habits formed, associations, reputation, position, character, are all determined.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But there is a blessed <span class="ital">contrast</span> between Esau’s experience and what may be ours. The desire to have the birthright is sure to bring it to us. No matter how late the desire is of springing, nor how long and insultingly we have suppressed it, we never go to our Father in vain with the cry, ‘Bless me, even me also.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?’<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/benson/genesis/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="/genesis/25-34.htm" title="Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.">Genesis 25:34</a></span>. <span class="ital">He did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way — </span>Without any serious reflections upon the ill bargain he had made, or any show of regret. <span class="ital">Thus Esau despised his birthright — </span>He used no means to get the bargain revoked, made no appeal to his father about it; but the bargain which his necessity had made, (supposing it were so,) his profaneness confirmed, and by his subsequent neglect and contempt, he put the matter past recall.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:29-34 We have here the bargain made between Jacob and Esau about the right, which was Esau's by birth, but Jacob's by promise. It was for a spiritual privilege; and we see Jacob's desire of the birth-right, but he sought to obtain it by crooked courses, not like his character as a plain man. He was right, that he coveted earnestly the best gifts; he was wrong, that he took advantage of his brother's need. The inheritance of their father's worldly goods did not descend to Jacob, and was not meant in this proposal. But it includeth the future possession of the land of Canaan by his children's children, and the covenant made with Abraham as to Christ the promised Seed. Believing Jacob valued these above all things; unbelieving Esau despised them. Yet although we must be of Jacob's judgment in seeking the birth-right, we ought carefully to avoid all guile, in seeking to obtain even the greatest advantages. Jacob's pottage pleased Esau's eye. Give me some of that red; for this he was called Edom, or Red. Gratifying the sensual appetite ruins thousands of precious souls. When men's hearts walk after their own eyes, Job 31:7, and when they serve their own bellies, they are sure to be punished. If we use ourselves to deny ourselves, we break the force of most temptations. It cannot be supposed that Esau was dying of hunger in Isaac's house. The words signify, I am going towards death; he seems to mean, I shall never live to inherit Canaan, or any of those future supposed blessings; and what signifies it who has them when I am dead and gone. This would be the language of profaneness, with which the apostle brands him, Heb 12:16; and this contempt of the birth-right is blamed, ver. 34. It is the greatest folly to part with our interest in God, and Christ, and heaven, for the riches, honours, and pleasures of this world; it is as bad a bargain as his who sold a birth-right for a dish of pottage. Esau ate and drank, pleased his palate, satisfied his appetite, and then carelessly rose up and went his way, without any serious thought, or any regret, about the bad bargain he had made. Thus Esau despised his birth-right. By his neglect and contempt afterwards, and by justifying himself in what he had done, he put the bargain past recall. People are ruined, not so much by doing what is amiss, as by doing it and not repenting of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Esau at forty years of age forms matrimonial connections with the Hittites. Heth was the second son of Kenaan, and had settled in the hills about Hebron. Esau had got acquainted with this tribe in his hunting expeditions. From their names we learn that they spoke the same language with himself. They belonged to a family far gone in transgression and apostasy from God. The two wives chosen from such a stock were a source of great grief to the parents of Esau. The choice manifested his tolerance at least of the carnal, and his indifference to the spiritual. <p> - Isaac Blessing His Sons<p>The life of Isaac falls into three periods. During the first seventy-five years he is contemporary with his father. For sixty-one years more his son Jacob remains under the paternal roof. The remaining forty-four years are passed in the retirement of old age. The chapter before us narrates the last solemn acts of the middle period of his life.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. Esau said &#8230; I am at the point to die&#8212;that is, I am running daily risk of my life; and of what use will the birthright be to me: so he despised or cared little about it, in comparison with gratifying his appetite&#8212;he threw away his religious privileges for a trifle; and thence he is styled "a profane person" (Heb 12:16; also Job 31:7, 16; 6:13; Php 3:19).

This shows what the pottage was made of, of which see <a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>; and that Jacob gave to Esau more than he asked and bargained for, bread as well as pottage; but neither of them until the bargain was made and swore to, and be had got the birthright secured unto him; as cunning as Esau, and as simple and plain as Jacob were, the latter outwitted the former, and was too crafty for him: <p>and he did eat, and drink, and rose up, and went his way; following his former course of life, without any remorse of conscience, reflection of mind, or repentance for what he had done; for though he afterwards carefully sought the blessing with tears he had parted with, yet not until his father was upon his deathbed, <a href="//biblehub.com/hebrews/12-17.htm">Hebrews 12:17</a>, <p>thus Esau despised his birthright; by setting it at so mean a price, and by not repenting of it when he had so done; having no regard especially to spiritual blessings, to the Messiah, and to the heavenly inheritance, eternal glory and happiness by Christ: the Jerusalem Targum adds,"and he despised his part in the world to come, and denied the resurrection of the dead;''and the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a> says, that"on that day he committed five transgressions; he performed strange worship (or committed idolatry), he shed innocent blood, he lay with a virgin betrothed, he denied the life of the world to come (or a future state), and despised the birthright;''which confirms the character the apostle gives of him, that he was a fornicator and a profane person, <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">lentils</span>] The pottage here described is made of a small reddish kind of bean much in use for food in Palestine, Arab. <span class="ital">‘adas</span>.

It makes the reddish pottage now called in Palestine <span class="ital">mujedderah</span>, a very popular dish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so Esau despised his birthright</span>] These words summarize the narrative. Esau’s character is portrayed as that of a careless, shallow man, living from hand to mouth, and paying no regard to things of higher or spiritual significance. It is this trait which is referred to in <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm" title="Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.">Hebrews 12:16</a>, “or profane person as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.” The advantage of the birthright may have been indefinite. But, as we may judge not only from the story in ch. 27, but also from that of <a href="/context/genesis/38-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first....">Genesis 38:28-30</a> and <a href="/context/genesis/48-13.htm" title="And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him....">Genesis 48:13-19</a> (cf. <a href="/context/deuteronomy/21-15.htm" title="If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:...">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>), the privilege of the birthright was accounted sacred in the social life of the early Israelite. The Lat. paraphrases the sense of the last clause, <span class="ital">parvi pendens quod primogenita vendidisset</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The birthright was Esau’s by God’s gift, not by his own merit. Hence it symbolized eternal blessing. Esau’s repudiation of the unseen and intangible, for the sake of immediate self-gratification, is the symbol of a large proportion of human sin and thoughtlessness.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils</span>.
