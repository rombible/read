This is evidently the intention of the list which follows of the twelve sons of Ishmael, who are given as princes of the tribes which sprang from them. Nebajoth and Kedar are mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a> as rich possessors of flocks, and, according to the current opinion which Wetzstein disputes, are the Nabataei et Cedrei of Pliny (h. n. 5, 12). The Nabataeans held possession of Arabia Petraea, with Petra as their capital, and subsequently extended toward the south and north-east, probably as far as Babylon; so that the name was afterwards transferred to all the tribes to the east of the Jordan, and in the Nabataean writings became a common name for Chaldeans (ancient Babylonians), Syrians, Canaanites, and others. The Kedarenes are mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/21-17.htm">Isaiah 21:17</a> as good bowmen. They dwelt in the desert between Arabia Petraea and Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>). According to Wetzstein, they are to be found in the nomad tribes of Arabia Petraea up to Harra. The name Dumah, &#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; &#x391;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1; (Ptol. v. 19, 7, Steph. Byz.), Domata (Plin. 6, 32), has been retained in the modern Dumat el Jendel in Nejd, the Arabian highland, four days' journey to the north of Taima. - Tema: a trading people (<a href="/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-14.htm">Isaiah 21:14</a>; mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>, between Dedan and Bus) in the land of Taima, on the border of Nejd and the Syrian desert. According to Wetzstein, Dma and Tma are still two important places in Eastern Hauran, three-quarters of an hour apart. Jetur and Naphish were neighbours of the tribes of Israel to the east of the Jordan (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-19.htm">1 Chronicles 5:19</a>), who made war upon them along with the Hagrites, the &#x391;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; of Ptol. and Strabo. From Jetur sprang the Ituraeans, who lived, according to Strabo, near the Trachonians in an almost inaccessible, mountainous, and cavernous country; according to Wetzstein, in the mountains of the Druses in the centre of the Hauran, possibly the forefathers of the modern Druses. The other names are not yet satisfactorily determined. For Adbeel, Mibsam, and Kedma, the Arabian legends give no corresponding names. Mishma is associated by Knobel with the &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2; of Ptol. vi. 7, 21, to the N.E. of Medina; Massa with the &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; on the N.E. of Duma; Hadad (the proper reading for Hadar, according to <a href="//biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-30.htm">1 Chronicles 1:30</a>, the lxx, Sam., Masor., and most MSS) with the Arabian coast land, Chathth, between Oman and Bahrein, a district renowned for its lancers (&#x3a7;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, Polyb.; Attene, Plin.).</body></html>
