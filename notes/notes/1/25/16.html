(See <a href="/leviticus/25-31.htm" title="But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.">Leviticus 25:31</a>, where it is exactly described; also <a href="/psalms/10-8.htm" title="He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places does he murder the innocent: his eyes are privately set against the poor.">Psalm 10:8</a><span class= "ital">·, </span><a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm" title="Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.">Isaiah 42:11</a>.) It was, however, a settled and permanent place of dwelling. The other word rendered here castle, but used as the equivalent of <span class= "ital">tent </span>in <a href="/psalms/69-25.htm" title="Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.">Psalm 69:25</a>, is really a cluster of tents, the encampment of a tribe, and movable. It occurs in <a href="/numbers/31-10.htm" title="And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelled, and all their goodly castles, with fire.">Numbers 31:10</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-54.htm" title="Now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts, of the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites: for theirs was the lot.">1Chronicles 6:54</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-4.htm" title="Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.">Ezekiel 25:4</a>. As is well known, the Arabs are divided into two classes—the dwellers in tents, who are ever moving from station to station, within certain limits, nevertheless, which they seldom pass over; and the agricultural class, who have fixed habitations, are looked upon as inferiors, and probably are the remains of a conquered race. To this day they pay a sort of rent, or black-mail, to the nobler Arabs. We find, then, this distinction already existing when this <span class= "ital">Tôldôth </span>was drawn up; the agricultural Arabs dwelling in unwalled villages, while the nomad tribes pitched now here, and now there, their clusters of black camels’-hair tents. And thus we have in these words proof that Ishmael and his subjects were not all upon the same level; for while he, his sons, and his noblest retainers would dwell in tents, the inhabitants of the villages would be men of inferior origin, compelled to submit themselves to him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:11-18 Ishmael had twelve sons, whose families became distinct tribes.
