Mr. Conder searched throughout the Ciccar for traces of the ruined cities, but in vain; and “the gradual rise of the level of the plain, caused by the constant washing down of the soft marl from the western hills, would effectually,” he thinks, “cover over any such ruins.” He found, however, copious springs of water upon the north-western side of the lake, and considers that the five cities were in their neighbourhood.<p><span class= "bld">Which is the salt sea.</span>—From these words commentators have rashly concluded that the vale of Sodom was swallowed up by the Dead Sea; but not only is no such convulsion of nature mentioned in Genesis 19, but Abram is described as seeing the Ciccar-land not submerged, but smoking like a furnace (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm" title="And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.">Genesis 19:28</a>). Probably “the vale of Siddim” was the name of the whole district in which these sidds, or bluffs, are situated, and which extend round all the northern shores of the lake. Mr. Conder, after tracing the lines of former beaches, which show that the Dead Sea has long been shrinking in extent, tells us (<span class= "ital">Tent-work, </span>ii. 43) that geologists hold that it had reached its present condition long before the days of Abram. It still, indeed, covered a much larger space, for the rains at that time were far more copious in Palestine than at present; but it no longer extended over the whole Arabah, as, by the evidence of these beaches, was once the case.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">The Horites.</span>—<span class= "ital">Cave-men, </span>the aboriginal inhabitants of Mount Seir, subsequently conquered by the Edomites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm" title="The Horims also dwelled in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-22.htm" title="As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead even to this day:">Deuteronomy 2:22</a>).

Out of covetousness, Lot had settled in fruitful, but wicked Sodom. Its inhabitants were the most ripe for vengeance of all the descendants of Canaan. The invaders were from Chaldea and Persia, then only small kingdoms. They took Lot among the rest, and his goods. Though he was righteous, and Abram's brother's son, yet he was with the rest in this trouble. Neither our own piety, nor our relation to the favourites of Heaven, will be our security when God's judgments are abroad. Many an honest man fares the worse for his wicked neighbours: it is our wisdom to separate, or at least to distinguish ourselves from them, 2Co 6:17. So near a relation of Abram should have been a companion and a disciple of Abram. If he chose to dwell in Sodom, he must thank himself if he share in Sodom's losses. When we go out of the way of our duty, we put ourselves from under God's protection, and cannot expect that the choice made by our lusts, should end to our comfort. They took Lot's goods; it is just with God to deprive us of enjoyments, by which we suffer ourselves to be deprived of the enjoyment of him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They made war. - Shinar was the central region from which the different branches of the human family dispersed after the confusion of tongues. It is possible that the mother country claimed some supremacy over the colonies. Shinar was also a great center of commerce, and the cities of the dale of Siddim formed another, of secondary importance. Intercourse between the two countries was therefore frequent. Abram himself had come from Ur Kasdim. The spirit of despotism had descended from Nimrod to the present potentates of the East, and prompted them to aim at universal empire. The five kings are the petty sovereigns, each of a single town and its neighborhood. The area in which these towns lay was very circumscribed. With the exception of the territory of Bela it was afterward submerged and formed part of the basin of the Salt Sea. Hence, Siddim is said to be the Salt Sea. The dale is the deep valley or glen in which these kings dwelt on the banks of the Jordan, or the salt lake into which it flowed. Of the five cities, Sodom was the chief in power, luxury, and wickedness; whence it is mentioned first. Bela is also called Zoar, "the little," and, hence, is placed last; even the name of its king is not given. "All these joined together." They formed a league in self-defense, and marched out to meet the enemy in the dale of Siddim.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 14<p>Ge 14:1-24.

The occasion was this: The king of Sodom and the kings of the adjoining cities, after having been tributaries for twelve years to the king of Elam, combined to throw off his yoke. To chastise their rebellion, as he deemed it, Chedorlaomer, with the aid of three allies, invaded the territories of the refractory princes, defeated them in a pitched battle where the nature of the ground favored his army (Ge 14:10), and hastened in triumph on his homeward march, with a large amount of captives and booty, though merely a stranger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which now is, though when this battle was fought it was not so. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim,....

Nothing lives in its waters. The name “Dead Sea” goes back to the time of Jerome, 6th cent. a.d.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these</span> - the last-named princes  - <span class="cmt_word">were joined together</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as confederates (so. and came with their forces) - in (literally, <span class="accented">to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the vale of Siddim</span>. The salt valley (LXX.); a wooded vale (Vulgate); a plain filled with rocky hollows (Gesenius), with which Ver. 10 agrees; the valley of plains or fields (Onkelos, Raschi, Keil, Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">Which is the salt sea.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> where the salt sea afterwards arose, on the destruction of the cities of the plain - <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24, 25</a> (Keil, Havernick; cf. Josephus, ' Bell. Jud.,' 4:08, 4); but the text scarcely implies that the cities were submerged-only the valley (cf. Quarry, p. 207). The extreme depression of the Dead Sea, being 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean ("the most depressed sheet of water in the world:" Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' <a href="/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>.), conjoined with its excessive saltness (containing 26.25 per cent of saline particles), renders it one of the most remarkable of inland lakes. Its shores are clothed with loom and desolation. Within a mile from northern embouchure the verdure of the rich Jordan valley dies away. Strewn along its desolate margin lie broken canes and willow branches, with trunks of palms, poplars, and other trees, half embedded in slimy mud, and all covered with incrustations of salt. At its south-western corner stands the mountain of rock salt, with its columnar fragments, which Josephus says, in his day was regarded as the pillar of Lot s wife. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After Lot's departure, Jehovah repeated to Abram (by a mental, inward assurance, as we may infer from the fact that &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; "said" is not accompanied by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488; "he appeared") His promise that He would give the land to him and to his seed in its whole extent, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward, and would make his seed innumerable like the dust of the earth. From this we may see that the separation of Lot was in accordance with the will of God, as Lot had no share in the promise of God; though God afterwards saved him from destruction for Abram's sake. The possession of the land is promised &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; &#1506;&#1491; "for ever." The promise of God is unchangeable. As the seed of Abraham was to exist before God for ever, so Canaan was to be its everlasting possession. But this applied not to the lineal posterity of Abram, to his seed according to the flesh, but to the true spiritual seed, which embraced the promise in faith, and held it in a pure believing heart. The promise, therefore, neither precluded the expulsion of the unbelieving seed from the land of Canaan, nor guarantees to existing Jews a return to the earthly Palestine after their conversion to Christ. For as Calvin justly says, "quam terra in saeculum promittitur, non simpliciter notatur perpetuitas; sed quae finem accepit in Christo." Through Christ the promise has been exalted from its temporal form to its true essence; through Him the whole earth becomes Canaan (vid., <a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). That Abram might appropriate this renewed and now more fully expanded promise, Jehovah directed him to walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it. In doing this he came in his "tenting," i.e., his wandering through the land, to Hebron, where he settled by the terebinth of the Amorite Mamre (<a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>), and built an altar to Jehovah. The term &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; (set himself, settled down, sat, dwelt) denotes that Abram made this place the central point of his subsequent stay in Canaan (cf. <a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>).
