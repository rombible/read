"His trained men." Abram had now a company of three hundred and eighteen trained men, born in his own house; which implies a following of more than one thousand men, women, and children. His flocks and herds must have corresponded in extent to such an establishment. "Unto Dan." This name is found in the Hebrew, Samaritan, Septuagint, and Onkelos. It might naturally be supposed that the sacred reviser of the text had inserted it here, had we not grounds for a contrary supposition. The custom of the reviser was to add the other name without altering the original; of which we have several examples in this very chapter <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2-3</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm">Genesis 14:7-8</a>, <a href="/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>. We are, therefore, led to regard Dan as in use at the time of Abram. Held at that remote period perhaps by some Hebrew, it fell at length into the hands of the Sidonians <a href="//biblehub.com/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, who named it Laish (lion) and Leshem (ligure).<p>Names of places in that eastern land vary, from a slight resemblance in sound (paronomasia), a resemblance in sense (synonyms), a change of masters, or some other cause. Laish and Leshem are significant names, partly alike in sound, and applied to the same town. They took the place of Dan when the town changed masters. The recollection of its ancient name and story may have attracted the Danites to the place, who burned Laish and built a new city which they again called Dan. This town was situated at the source of the lesser Jordan, with which some have connected its name. Its site is now occupied by Tell el-Kady, the hill of "the judge." This is a case of resemblance in sense between varying names. Others, however, distinguish the present Dan from the Laish Dan, and identify it with Danjaan or jaar, "Dan in the wood" <a href="/2_samuel/24-6.htm">2 Samuel 24:6</a>. The former is not on the road to Damascus, while the latter was north of Gilead, and may have been near the route either by the south of the sea of Kinnereth, or of the waters of Merom. This is possible, and deserves consideration. But there may have been a third way to Damascus, passing Tell el-Kady; this place itself is on the east side of the main stream of the Jordan, and the expression &#1512;&#1506;&#1503;  &#1491;&#1504;&#1492;  da&#772;na&#770;h ya'an is confessedly obscure.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants&#8212;domestic slaves, such as are common in Eastern countries still and are considered and treated as members of the family. If Abram could spare three hundred and eighteen slaves and leave a sufficient number to take care of the flocks, what a large establishment he must have had.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He armed his trained servants, </span> whom he had disciplined and instructed both in religion and in the military art too, both which were necessary to make them good soldiers, that they might both fight with skill and courage, and also rely upon God, and engage his assistance; which was now especially necessary, when so small a party were to engage against so numerous an army. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dan</span> is commonly thought to be a town then called <span class="ital">Leshem, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a></span>, or <span class="ital">Laish, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/18-7.htm" title="Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.">Judges 18:7</a></span>, and afterwards <span class="ital">Dan; </span> see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/judges/18-7.htm" title="Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelled careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.">Judges 18:7</a>,29</span>; so it is an anticipation. But it may be doubted whether this was a city; or if it were, whether it were not another town called by the same name, which was frequent in those parts.

That is, his brother's son Lot, as in <a href="/genesis/14-12.htm">Genesis 14:12</a>; which was contrary to the law of nations; since Lot was only a sojourner, and not an inhabitant n Sodom, and therefore had no concern in the quarrel between the kings, and this justified Abram's taking up arms on his behalf: <p>he armed his trained servants; such as were trained up by him in religious exercises, see <a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>; in the affairs and business of civil life, in the care of flocks and herds, and particularly in the art of war; which was both lawful and necessary, for the preservation of his family and substance from oppressors: <p>born in his own house; of his servants, and so were his property, and at his disposal and command; their number was <p>three hundred and eighteen, a large number for servants, and which showed how great a man Abram was, what possessions he must have to employ so many, and yet but a small number for an army, to go forth with against four kings who had conquered five; though how many his confederates brought with them is not certain: <p>and pursued them unto Dan; the Jerusalem Targum is, to Dan of Caesarea, meaning Caesarea of Philippi, as in the times of Christ and his apostles it was called; which at first had the name of Leshem, or Lais, and was not called Dan until the times of the judges, <a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>; wherefore, if the same place is intended here, it is so called not only by anticipation, but by a spirit of prophecy; since it had not the name of Dan even in the times of Moses, the writer of this history, unless it may be thought to be inserted by Samuel or some other inspired writer, after Moses; though there is no need to suppose either of these, seeing there might be a town or city of this name in those parts at this time, or however one of the springs of Jordan might be so called, from whence the river had its name as early, <a href="/genesis/13-11.htm">Genesis 13:11</a>; and so Josephus (f) expressly says, speaking of this expedition, that Abram fell upon them at Dan, for so, adds he, the other fountain of Jordan is called. <p>(f) Antiqu. l. 1. c. 10. sect. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">And when Abram heard</span>] It is implied that, if Lot had not been taken prisoner, Abram would not have stirred either to attack the invader or to assist the native kings. But, as a dweller at Hebron, he was within sight of “the land of the Plain,” cf. <a href="/genesis/19-28.htm" title="And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, see, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.">Genesis 19:28</a>; and must have been well aware of Chedorlaomer’s punitive expedition against the kings of the Plain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his brother</span>] i.e. kinsman: see note on <a href="/genesis/13-8.htm" title="And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we be brothers.">Genesis 13:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">led forth</span>] Lit. “emptied out,” or “unsheathed,” used of arrows from a quiver, or of a sword from a sheath. Driver gives the meaning “drew out rapidly and in full numbers.” The LXX <span class="greekheb">ἠρίθμησεν</span>, “counted” or “mustered,” Lat. <span class="ital">numeravit</span>, following probably a reading which is also found in the Samaritan version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his trained men, born in his house</span>] i.e. his most faithful retainers, the slaves (<span class="ital">a</span>) born in his household, as distinguished from those obtained by purchase; (<span class="ital">b</span>) specially exercised in the use of arms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">three hundred and eighteen</span>] This exact figure seems strange. The old Jewish commentators explained it by pointing out that the numerical value of the Heb. letters of the name “Eliezer,” Abram’s steward (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>), was 318. In modern times Winckler has found some supporters for the astronomical explanation, that the moon is visible for 318 days in the year; and that the number of Abram’s retainers must, therefore, indicate that the story of Abram is blended with a lunar myth. The two explanations possess a certain kind of resemblance in their ingenuity and their improbability.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Dan</span>] The pursuit of Abram enabled him to overtake the booty-laden army at Laish (<a href="/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a>), on the north frontier of Canaan.

The mention of Dan, therefore, is, strictly speaking, an anachronism, though quite intelligible. That Abram should overtake and smite his enemy at the furthest northern limit of the future Israelite country, is a feature in the story not without symbolical significance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, if Abram with a small force had to pursue the enemy the whole length of Palestine, the retiring army, though burdened with spoil, must have marched at a high rate of speed.

Murphy regards Dan as the original designation of the town, which was changed under the Sidonians to Laish (lion), and restored at the conquest. Clericus suggests that the Jordan fountain may have been styled Dan, "Judge," and the neighboring town Laish, and that the Danites, observing the coincidence of the former with the name of their own tribe, gave it to the city they had conquered.
