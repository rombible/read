They had probably been driven thence by the pressure of Semitic races, with whose language they had thus already become familiar; and when, farther, they found a Semitic people thinly spread over Palestine, they may, while absorbing them, have been confirmed in the use of their tongue. So, subsequently, Abraham gave up Syriac for Hebrew; and though these are kindred dialects, yet they are often remote enough from one another (see <a href="/genesis/31-47.htm" title="And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.">Genesis 31:47</a>). On the other hand, the whole character of the Canaanite religion and thought was Hamitic, and while they Were active in commercial pursuits, and in culture far in advance of the Greeks, to whom they gave their alphabet, they were intensely sensuous in their worship and voluptuous in their manners. They are divided into eleven tribes, namely:—<p>1.<span class= "bld"> Sidon.</span>—This is remarkable as being the only town mentioned in the account either of Mizraim or of Canaan. All the rest are apparently the names of tribes still wandering about; and thus we gain a clearer idea both of the antiquity of this early record, and also of the great advance made by Nimrod in founding so many cities. Sidon, situated on the sea-shore, about thirty miles north of Tyre, became thus early a settled community and the seat of social life, because of its advantages for fishing (whence its name is derived), and also for commerce.<p>2.<span class= "bld"> Heth.</span>—The Kheta, or Hittites, a powerful race, whose language and monuments have recently become the object of careful study. They seem subsequently to have possessed not only Syria, but a large portion of Asia Minor.

While in Babylonia the Hamites are described as black, this branch was called Phœnicians, from their ruddy colour, in contrast with the olive-coloured Semitic stock. As they came by sea from the Indian Ocean, their earliest settlement was on the coast, and thus Sidon is called “the first-born” of Ham. Thence they advanced into the interior, and though few in number, absorbed by their superior culture the inhabitants of Palestine.

Those that are under the curse of God, may, perhaps, thrive and prosper in this world; for we cannot know love or hatred, the blessing or the curse, by what is before us, but by what is within us. The curse of God always works really, and always terribly. Perhaps it is a secret curse, a curse to the soul, and does not work so that others can see it; or a slow curse, and does not work soon; but sinners are reserved by it for a day of wrath Canaan here has a better land than either Shem or Japheth, and yet they have a better lot, for they inherit the blessing. Abram and his seed, God's covenant people, descended from Eber, and from him were called Hebrews.

It is situated on the Orontes, and held an important place in the history of Israel.

We do not know what was the original seat of the Kenaanites; or whether the dispersion here mentioned was violent or not. Its primary result, however, seems to have been their settlement in the country of which the boundaries are next described. It is not improbable that this land was allotted to a portion of the Shemites, and occupied by them when the Kenaanites entered and established themselves among them <a href="/genesis/40-15.htm">Genesis 40:15</a>. The Kenaanites probably had the same grasping tendency which displayed itself in Nimrod, their kinsman; and therefore seized upon the country with a high hand, and called it after their name. Their expulsion, on the conquest of the land by the Israelites, and their commercial activity, led to a still further dispersion; as colonies were sent out by them to the distant shores of the Mediterranean, to Asia Minor, Greece, Africa, Spain, and even the British Isles. But it can scarcely be supposed that reference is here made to these subsequent events in their history.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Their language has not yet (1913) been deciphered. The Hittite empire appears to have lasted from 1800 b.c. to 700 b.c. Carchemish on the Euphrates was for a time their capital. They made their influence felt throughout Syria and Asia Minor. Their famous collision with Egypt occurred in the reign of Rameses III, about 1180 b.c. The mention of Heth as the “son of Canaan” is probably to be understood as indicating the presence of a large number of Hittite dwellers in Phoenicia and Palestine. There are traces of these elsewhere in O.T., e.g. ch. 23; <a href="/numbers/13-29.htm" title="The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="/judges/1-26.htm" title="And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof to this day.">Jdg 1:26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm" title="And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.">1 Kings 10:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2 Kings 7:6</a>.

"The Jebusite:" inhabitants of Jebus, afterwards called Jerusalem. "The Amorite:" not the inhabitants of the mountain or heights, for the derivation from &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;, "summit," is not established, but a branch of the Canaanites, descended from Emor (Amor), which was spread far and wide over the mountains of Judah and beyond the Jordan in the time of Moses, so that in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>, all the Canaanites are comprehended by the name. "The Girgashites," &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx), are also mentioned in <a href="/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>, and <a href="/joshua/24-11.htm">Joshua 24:11</a>; but their dwelling-place is unknown, as the reading &#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769; in <a href="/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28</a> is critically suspicious. "The Hivites" dwelt in Sichem (<a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>), at Gibeon (<a href="/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>), and at the foot of Hermon (<a href="/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>); the meaning of the word is uncertain. "The Arkites:" inhabitants of &#x391;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;, to the north of Tripolis at the foot of Lebanon, the ruins of which still exist (vid., Robinson). "The Sinite:" the inhabitants of Sin or Sinna, a place in Lebanon not yet discovered. "The Arvadite," or Aradians, occupied from the eighth century before Christ, the small rocky island of Arados to the north of Tripolis. "The Zemarite:" the inhabitants of Simyra in Eleutherus. "The Hamathite:" the inhabitants or rather founders of Hamath on the most northerly border of Palestine (<a href="/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>), afterwards called Epiphania, on the river Orontes, the present Hamh, with 100,000 inhabitants. The words in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>, "and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad," mean that they all proceeded from one local centre as branches of the same tribe, and spread themselves over the country, the limits of which are given in two directions, with evident reference to the fact that it was afterwards promised to the seed of Abraham for its inheritance, viz., from north to south, - "from Sidon, in the direction (lit., as thou comest) towards Gerar (see <a href="/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1</a>), unto Gaza," the primitive Avvite city of the Philistines (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>), now called Guzzeh, at the S.W. corner of Palestine, - and thence from west to east, in the direction towards Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim (see <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) to Lesha," i.e., Calirrhoe, a place with sulphur baths, on the eastern side of the Dead Sea, in Wady Serka Maein (Seetzen and Ritter). </body></html>
