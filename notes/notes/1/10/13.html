The <span class= "bld">Ludim.</span>—There were two races of this name: one Semitic, descended from Lud, the son of Shem (<a href="/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22</a>), and mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/66-19.htm" title="And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.">Isaiah 66:19</a>; the other Hamite, and subject to the Pharaohs ( <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm" title="Come up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm" title="Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). They seem to have inhabited the Nile valley, but their exact position is unknown.<p>2. The <span class= "bld">Anamim.</span>—Knobel gives some reasons for supposing this race to have inhabited the Delta.<p>3. The <span class= "bld">Lehabim.</span>—Probably the same as the Lubim of <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you did rely on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.">2Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-43.htm" title="But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.">Daniel 11:43</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm" title="Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.">Nahum 3:9</a>. Their home was on the western side of the Delta.<p>4. The <span class= "bld">Naphtuhim.</span>—Knobel explains these as “the people of Phthah, the deity worshipped at Memphis.” If so, they were the true Egyptians, as Egypt is Kah-Phthah, “the land of Phthah,’ or more correctly, according to Canon Cook, Ai-Capth. (See Note on Capthorim.)<p>5. The <span class= "bld">Pathrusim.</span>—People of Pathros, or Upper Egypt. According to Canon Cook, Pa-t-res means “the land of the south.”<p>6. The <span class= "bld">Casluhim.</span>—Probably the people of Cassiotis, a mountainous district to the east of Pelusium.<p>7. The <span class= "bld">Philistim.</span>—The word Philistine means <span class= "ital">emigrant, </span>and is translated <span class= "ital">alien, foreigner, by </span>the LXX·We are here told that they came into Palestine as colonists from the Casluhim; but in <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm" title="Because of the day that comes to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remains: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.">Jeremiah 47:4</a>, <a href="/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a>, they are described as a colony from Caphtor. Probably the first Philistine settlers in Gerar (<a href="/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>), and in the towns conquered by Judah (<a href="/judges/1-18.htm" title="Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.">Judges 1:18</a>), were Casluchians; but afterwards, at the time when they struggled with Israel for empire, in the days of Samson, Eli, and Saul, there had been a second and larger immigration from Crete. As they seem to have spoken a Semitic tongue, they had apparently adopted the language of the Canaanites among whom they had settled, and especially of the Avim (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm" title="And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). The objection to their being of Egyptian origin, brought from their neglect of the rite of circumcision, has but little weight. The Israelites all but discontinued it (<a href="/joshua/5-5.htm" title="Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.">Joshua 5:5</a>), and colonists escaped from the dominion of the priests might gladly dispense with such a custom. There is also much reason for believing that the institution of circumcision in Egypt was of a date subsequent to this emigration.<p>8. The <span class= "bld">Caphtorim </span>are generally connected with Crete, but Egyptologers derive the name from Kah-Phthah, “the land of Phthah.” According to this, the Caphtorim, like the Naphtuhim, would have been true Egyptians, and the Delta, with Memphis, for their capital, would have been their original home. The need of expansion, joined to the seafaring habits learnt on the shores of the Delta, may easily have led them to colonise Crete, while others of the race were going as settlers into Palestine. It is worth notice that while Cyprus and Rhodes are given to the sons of Javan (<a href="/genesis/10-4.htm" title="And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.">Genesis 10:4</a>), no mention is there made of Crete.<p>It is plain from this survey that Mizraim at this time was not of very great extent, these seven tribes being confined to the lands closely bordering on the Delta and the upper part of the Nile valley. There is nothing to indicate that the great city of Thebes had as yet come into existence.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/mhc/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:8-14 Nimrod was a great man in his day; he began to be mighty in the earth, Those before him were content to be upon the same level with their neighbours, and though every man bare rule in his own house, yet no man pretended any further. Nimrod was resolved to lord it over his neighbours. The spirit of the giants before the flood, who became mighty men, and men of renown, Ge 6:4, revived in him. Nimrod was a great hunter. Hunting then was the method of preventing the hurtful increase of wild beasts. This required great courage and address, and thus gave an opportunity for Nimrod to command others, and gradually attached a number of men to one leader. From such a beginning, it is likely, that Nimrod began to rule, and to force others to submit. He invaded his neighbours' rights and properties, and persecuted innocent men; endeavouring to make all his own by force and violence. He carried on his oppressions and violence in defiance of God himself. Nimrod was a great ruler. Some way or other, by arts or arms, he got into power, and so founded a monarchy, which was the terror of the mighty, and bid fair to rule all the world. Nimrod was a great builder. Observe in Nimrod the nature of ambition. It is boundless; much would have more, and still cries, Give, give. It is restless; Nimrod, when he had four cities under his command, could not be content till he had four more. It is expensive; Nimrod will rather be at the charge of rearing cities, than not have the honour of ruling them. It is daring, and will stick at nothing. Nimrod's name signifies rebellion; tyrants to men are rebels to God. The days are coming, when conquerors will no longer be spoken of with praise, as in man's partial histories, but be branded with infamy, as in the impartial records of the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mizraim has seven sons, from whom are derived eight nations.<p>(26) the Ludim are probably mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>, in connection with Tarshish and Put; in <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>, in connection with Kush and Put; and in <a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>, in connection with Put. In all these instances the name is in the singular, but in our text in the plural, expressly denoting the nation of which Lud was the progenitor. The Ludim were distinguished for the use of the bow. They were, doubtless, an African tribe, related to the Egyptians, and well known to the prophets, though their country cannot now be pointed out. Josephus intimates that they were destroyed, as well as other tribes descended from Mizraim, in the Ethiopic war of the time of Moses; but they still existed in the times of Ezekiel. Movers finds them in the Lewatah, a tribe of Berbers. Others place them in Mauretania. Pliny mentions a river Laud in Tingitana.<p>(27) the Anamim are not elsewhere mentioned.<p>(28) the Lehabim are generally identified with the Lubim <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>, who are introduced in connection with the Kushim. They are probably the Libyans, who lay to the west of Egypt, and, extending from the Mediterranean indefinitely to the south, came into contact with the Kushites of Abyssinia.<p>(29) the Naphtuhim Bochart places in Nephthys, near Pelusium on the Lake Sirbonis. Others find a trace of them in Napata, a town of Meroe. This agrees with the indications of Josephus and the Targum of Jonathan.<p>(30) the Pathrusim have their place in Pathros, a name of upper Egypt or the Thebais. It is arranged by Isaiah Isa 2:11 between Egypt and Kush.<p>(31) the Kasluhim are supposed by some to be represented by the Colchians, whom Herodotus (ii. 104) traces to Egypt. It is possible the Colchians may have been a colony from them. But their original seat must have been somewhere on the coast of the Red Sea.<p>(32) Philistim, who came from (31). The Philistines dwelt on the coast of the Mediterranean, from the border of Egypt to Joppa. They had five principal cities, - Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. They gave the name &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;  peleshet, Pelesheth, to the whole of Kenaan, from which is derived the Greek name &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  Palaistinee "Palaestina." They are stated by the text to be a colony or offshoot of the Kasluhim.<p>(33) Kaphtorim. From <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>, it appears that Kaphtor was a coastland. From <a href="//biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>, we learn that the Philistines came from this land. Hence, we conclude that the Kaphtorim dwelt on the coast of the Red Sea, adjacent to the Kasluchim, and left their name, perhaps, in Koptos and &#x391;&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Aiguptos. Cappadocia, Crete, and Cyprus only slightly resemble the name, and have no other recommendation. The Kasluhim may have been their southern neighbors, and thus the Philistines may have occupied a part of Kaphtor, before their settlement on the coast of the Great Sea, within the borders of Kenaan, where they would, of course, be another tribe (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  allophuloi). This account of these descendants of Mizraim agrees best with the hint of Josephus, that many of them bordered on the Ethiopians; and perished, or perhaps were forced to migrate, in the Ethiopic or other wars (i. 6, 3). Thus, it appears that the descendants of Mizraim were settled in Africa, with the exception of the Philistines, who migrated into the country to which they gave their name.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Out of that land went forth Asshur&#8212;or, as the Margin has it, "He [Nimrod] at the head of his army went forth into Assyria," that is, he pushed his conquests into that country.<p>and builded Nineveh&#8212;opposite the town of Mosul, on the Tigris, and the other towns near it. This raid into Assyria was an invasion of the territories of Shem, and hence the name "Nimrod," signifying "rebel," is supposed to have been conferred on him from his daring revolt against the divine distribution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ludim</span> and the following names here and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/10-14.htm" title="And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.">Genesis 10:14</a></span>, observe two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Mizraim was the second son of Ham, of whom See Gill on <a href="/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>. Ludim he is said to beget, the word being plural, is not the name of a man, but of his posterity; and the sense is, that Mizraim begat the father of the Ludim, whose name very probably was Lud, which name is preserved in <a href="/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>. These Ludim are the same with the Lydians, <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> and whose country is called Lydia, <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> but to be distinguished from Lydia in Asia Minor, and the Lydians there who sprung from Lud, a son of Shem, <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a> for, as these sprung from Mizraim, the founder of Egypt, they must be somewhere thereabout; and Bochart (f) has proved, by various arguments, that they are the Ethiopians in Africa, now called Abyssines, whose country lies to the south of Egypt, a people formerly famous for archery, as Lud and the Lydians are said to be, <a href="/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a> and whoever reads the accounts Diodorus Siculus (g) gives of the Egyptians and Ethiopians, will easily discern a likeness between them, and that the one sprung from the other; both deifying their kings; showing a like carefulness about their funerals; both using hieroglyphics; having the like order of priests, who used shaving; and circumcision was common to them both, as Herodotus observes (h): <p>and Ananzim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim: the name of the father of the Anamim very probably was Anam, though we have no account of him elsewhere: according to Hillerus (i), the Anamim were called so from the pastoral life they led; and, by a transposition of letters, were the same with the Maeonians, who inhabited that tract of land in Asia which was washed by the river Maeonia, or Maeander, and bordered on Lydia; but, as these were the descendants of Mizraim, they must be sought for somewhere about Egypt: much better therefore does Mr. Broughton (k) take them to be the Nubians and Numidians, which were near both Egypt and Ethiopia; though Bochart (l) seems to be most correct, in making them to be the Ammonians, who, Herodotus says, were a colony of the Egyptians and Ethiopians; these lived about Ammon and Nasamonitis, and in that part of Lybia in which the temple of Jupiter Ammon stood, and are the Nomades, that lived a pastoral life; and Bochart (m) thinks they are called Anamim, from Anam, which, in the Arabic language, signifies a "sheep", because they fed sheep, and lived upon them, and clothed themselves with their skins. The word Lehabim, the name of another people from Mizraim, signifies "flames"; and were so called, as Jarchi observes, because their faces were like flames, see <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a> burnt with the heat of the sun, living near the torrid zone; and therefore could not be the Lycians, as Hillerus (n) thinks, the inhabitants of a country in Asia, between Caria and Pamphylia, formerly called Lycia, now Aidimelli, which he observes abounds with places that have their names from fire and flames, as Mount Chimaera, the cities Hephaestium, Myra, Lemyra, Habessus, Telmessus, Balbura, and Sirbis; but these were too far from Egypt, near which it is more probable the Lehabim were, and seem to be the same with the Lubim, which came with Shishak out of Egypt to invade Judea, <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a> and who were called Lybians, <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> and their country Lybia, <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> of which Leo Africanus (a) says, that it is a desert, dry and sandy, having neither fountains nor springs; which was near Egypt as well as Ethiopia, with which it is joined in the above place, see <a href="/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>. The word Naphtuhim, the name of another people that sprung from Mizraim, according to Hillerus (o), signifies "open"; and he thinks they are the Pamphylians, who used to admit promiscuously all into their ports and towns, which were open to all strangers, and even robbers, for the sake of commerce; but, as these were a people in lesser Asia, they cannot be the people here meant. Bochart (p) observes, from Plutarch, that the Egyptians used to call the extreme parts of a country, and abrupt places and mountains adjoining to the sea, Nepthys, the same with Nephthuah; and therefore he is of opinion, that these Naphtuhim dwelt on the shores of the Mediterranean sea, near Egypt, in Marmorica; not far from whence was the temple of Aptuchus, mentioned by Ptolemy (q), and placed by him in Cyrene, which carries in it some trace of the name of Naphtuhim; and he suspects that Neptune had his name from hence; he being a Lybian god, as Herodotus (r) says; for none ever used his name before the Lybians, who always honoured him as a god: and it may be observed, from Strabo (s), that many of the temples of Neptune were on the sea shore. Some place these people about Memphis, the name of which was Noph, <a href="/isaiah/19-13.htm">Isaiah 19:13</a> but perhaps it may be much better to place them in the country of Nepate, between Syene and Meroc, where Candace, queen of Ethiopia, had her royal palace in the times of Strabo (t). <p>(f) Phaleg. l. 4. c. 26.

Cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/1-11.htm" title="And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,">1 Chronicles 1:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Lehabim</span>] Possibly the same as the “Libyans,” who appear as Lubim in <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="With twelve hundred chariots, and three score thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm" title="Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you did rely on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-43.htm" title="But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.">Daniel 11:43</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm" title="Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were your helpers.">Nahum 3:9</a>. The Libyans were the African tribes west of Cyrene.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Naphtuhim</span>] The Egyptologist Erman suggests that this name is the corruption of the word <span class="ital">P-t-mḥi</span>, the Egyptian designation for the dwellers in the north, i.e. the Delta of Egypt (<span class="ital">Z. A. T.

Cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/1-11.htm" title="And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,">1 Chronicles 1:11</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Mizraim begat Ludim</span>. An African tribe, a colony of the Egyptians, like the next seven, which are "nomina non singulorum hominum sed populorum" (Aben Ezra, Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Murphy); probably referred to in connection with Tarshish and Put (<a href="/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>), with Kush and Put (<a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>), and in connection with Put (<a href="/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). Lud (ver. 22) was Shemitic. <span class="cmt_word">And Anamim</span>. Not elsewhere mentioned; the inhabitants of the Delta (Knobel). <span class="cmt_word">And Lehabim</span>.

Nephthys, near Pelusium; on the Lake Sirbenis (Bochart); the Libyan town Napata (Kalisch); the people of Middle Egypt (Knobel). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From Mizraim descended Ludim: not the Semitic Ludim (<a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>), but, according to Movers, the old tribe of the Lewtah dwelling on the Syrtea, according to others, the Moorish tribes collectively. Whether the name is connected with the Laud flumen (Plin. v. 1) is uncertain; in any case Knobel is wrong in thinking of Ludian Shemites, whether Hyksos, who forced their way to Egypt, or Egyptianized Arabians. Anamim: inhabitants of the Delta, according to Knobel. He associates the Enemetiei'm of the lxx with Sanemhit, or Northern Egypt: "tsanemhit, i.e., pars, regio septentrionis." Lehabim ( equals  Lubim, <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>) are, according to Josephus, the &#x394;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; or &#x394;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, not the great Libyan tribe (Phut, v. 6), which Nahum distinguishes from them, but the Libyaegyptii of the ancients. Naphtuchim: in Knobel's opinion, the Middle Egyptians, as the nation of Pthah, the god of Memphis: but Bochart is more probably correct in associating the name with &#x39d;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; in Plut. de Is., the northern coast line of Egypt. Pathrusim: inhabitants of Pathros, &#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, Egypt. Petrs, land of the south; i.e., Upper Egypt, the Thebais of the ancients. Casluchim: according to general admission the Colchians, who descended from the Egyptians (Herod. ii. 104), though the connection of the name with Cassiotis is uncertain. "From thence (i.e., from Casluchim, which is the name of both people and country) proceeded the Philistines." Philistim, lxx &#x3a6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc; or &#x391;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, lit., emigrants or immigrants from the Ethiopic falla&#770;sa. This is not at variance with <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>, according to which the Philistines came from Caphtor, so that there is no necessity to transpose the relative clause after Philistim. The two statements may be reconciled on the simple supposition that the Philistian nation was primarily a Casluchian colony, which settled on the south-eastern coast line of the Mediterranean between Gaza (<a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>) and Pelusium, but was afterwards strengthened by immigrants from Caphtor, and extended its territory by pressing out the Avim (<a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, cf. <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>). Caphtorim: according to the old Jewish explanation, the Cappadocians; but according to Lakemacher's opinion, which has been revived by Ewald, etc., the Cretans. This is not decisively proved, however, either by the name Cherethites, given to the Philistines in <a href="/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>, and <a href="//biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>, or by the expression "isle of Caphtor" in <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>.</body></html>
