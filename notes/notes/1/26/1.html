The real worth of God's promises cannot be lessened to a believer by any cross providences that may befall him. If God engage to be with us, and we are where he would have us to be, nothing but our own unbelief and distrust can prevent our comfort. The obedience of Abraham to the Divine command, was evidence of that faith, whereby, as a sinner, he was justified before God, and the effect of that love whereby true faith works. God testifies that he approved this obedience, to encourage others, especially Isaac.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div> - The Events of Isaac's Life<p>5. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;  m&#305;&#770;shmeret, "charge, ordinance." &#1502;&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;  m&#305;&#770;tsva&#770;h, "command," special order. &#1495;&#1511;  choq, "decree, statute," engraven on stone or metal. &#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;  to&#770;ra&#770;h, "law," doctrine, system of moral truth.<p>10. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;  &#8219;e&#770;s&#769;eq, 'Eseq, "strife."<p>21. &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1504;&#1492;  s&#769;&#305;&#770;t&#803;na&#770;h, Sitnah, "opposition."<p>22. &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;  rechobo&#770;t, Rechoboth, "room."<p>26. &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;&#1514;  'a&#780;chuzat, Achuzzath, "possession."<p>33. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1492;  sh&#305;&#770;b&#8219;a&#770;h, Shib'ah, "seven; oath."<p>34. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1514;  yehu&#770;d&#305;&#770;yt, Jehudith, "praised." &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;  be'e&#772;r&#305;&#770;y, Beeri, "of a well." &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;  ba&#772;s&#769;emat, Basemath, "sweet smell." &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1503;  'e&#770;ylon, Elon, "oak."<p>This chapter presents the leading events in the quiet life of Isaac. It is probable that Abraham was now dead. In that case, Esau and Jacob would be at least fifteen years of age when the following event occurred.<p><a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/26-1.htm">Genesis 26:1-5</a><p>Renewal of the promise to Isaac. "A famine in the land." We left Isaac, after the death of Abraham, at Beer-lahai-roi <a href="/genesis/25-11.htm">Genesis 25:11</a>. The preceding events have only brought us up to the same point of time. This well was in the land of the south <a href="/genesis/24-62.htm">Genesis 24:62</a>. The present famine is distinguished from what occurred in the time of Abraham <a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>. The interval between them is at least a hundred years. The author of this, the ninth document, is, we find, acquainted with the seventh document; and the famine to which he refers is among the earliest events recorded in it. There is no reason to doubt, then, that he has the whole history of Abraham before his mind. "Unto Abimelek unto Gerar." The Abimelek with whom Abraham had contact about eighty years before may have been the father of the present sovereign. Both Abimelek and Phikol seem to have been official names. Gerar <a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a> was apparently on the brook of Mizraim <a href="//biblehub.com/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>, the Wady el-Arish, or the Wady el-Khubarah, a northern affluent of the former, or in the interval between them. It is on the way to Egypt, and is the southern city of the Philistines, who probably came from Egypt <a href="/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>.

Seventy or eighty years having elapsed since Abraham's sojourn in Gerar, it is scarcely probable that this was the monarch who then reigned. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The difference in the characters of the two brothers was soon shown in a singular circumstance, which was the turning-point in their lives. Esau returned home one day from the field quite exhausted, and seeing Jacob with a dish of lentils, still a favourite dish in Syria and Egypt, he asked with passionate eagerness for some to eat: "Let me swallow some of that red, that red there;" &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, the brown-red lentil pottage. From this he received the name Edom, just as among the ancient Arabians persons received names from quite accidental circumstances, which entirely obscured their proper names. Jacob made us of his brother's hunger to get him to sell his birthright. The birthright consisted afterwards in a double portion of the father's inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>); but with the patriarchs it embraced the chieftainship, the rule over the brethren and the entire family (<a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>), and the title to the blessing of the promise (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-4.htm">Genesis 27:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27-29</a>), which included the future possession of Canaan and of covenant fellowship with Jehovah (<a href="/genesis/28-4.htm">Genesis 28:4</a>). Jacob knew this, and it led him to anticipate the purposes of God. Esau also knew it, but attached no value to it. There is proof enough that he knew he was giving away, along with the birthright, blessings which, because they were not of a material but of a spiritual nature, had no particular value in his estimation, in the words he made use of: "Behold I am going to die (to meet death), and what is the birthright to me?" The only thing of value to him was the sensual enjoyment of the present; the spiritual blessings of the future his carnal mind was unable to estimate. In this he showed himself to be &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>), a profane man, who cared for nothing but the momentary gratification of sensual desires, who "did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way, and so despised his birthright" (<a href="/genesis/25-34.htm">Genesis 25:34</a>). With these words the Scriptures judge and condemn the conduct of Esau. Just as Ishmael was excluded from the promised blessing because he was begotten "according to the flesh," so Esau lost it because his disposition was according to the flesh. The frivolity with which he sold his birthright to his brother for a dish of lentils, rendered him unfit to be the heir and possessor of the promised grace. But this did not justify Jacob's conduct in the matter. Though not condemned here, yet in the further course of the history it is shown to have been wrong, by the simple fact that he did not venture to make this transaction the basis of a claim. </body></html>
