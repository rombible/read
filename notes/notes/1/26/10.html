The falls of those who are gone before us are so many rocks on which others have split; and the recording of them is like placing buoys to save future mariners. This Abimelech was not the same that lived in Abraham's days, but both acted rightly.

We see how insecure a female's honor was in those days, if she was in a strange land, and had not a band of men to keep back the hand of violence. We perceive also that God mercifully protects his chosen ones from the perils which they bring upon themselves by the vain self-reliance and wicked policy of the old corrupt nature. This remnant of the old man we find in the believers of old, as in those of the present time, though it be different and far less excusable in its recent manifestations.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 26<p>Ge 26:1-35.

Abraham went to Egypt, where his wife was exposed to danger, from which she could only be rescued by the direct interposition of God. Isaac also intended to go there, but on the way, viz., in Gerar, he received instruction through a divine manifestation that he was to remain there. As he was the seed to whom the land of Canaan was promised, he was directed not to leave it. To this end Jehovah assured him of the fulfilment of all the promises made to Abraham on oath, with express reference to His oath (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>) to him and to his posterity, and on account of Abraham's obedience of faith. The only peculiarity in the words is the plural, "all these lands." This plural refers to all the lands or territories of the different Canaanitish tribes, mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>, like the different divisions of the kingdom of Israel or Judah in <a href="/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-23.htm">2 Chronicles 11:23</a>. &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;; an antique form of &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; occurring only in the Pentateuch.
