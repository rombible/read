Kings' hearts are in his hands, and when he pleases, he can turn them to favour his people. It is not wrong to stand upon our guard in dealing with those who have acted unfairly. But Isaac did not insist on the unkindnesses they had done him; he freely entered into friendship with them. Religion teaches us to be neighbourly, and, as much as in us lies, to live peaceable with all men. Providence smiled upon what Isaac did; God blessed his labours.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The treaty with Abimelek. This is an interview similar to what Abraham had with the king of Gerar; and its object is a renewal of the former league between the parties. Besides Phikol, the commander-in-chief, he is now accompanied by Ahuzzath, his privy counsellor. Isaac upbraids him with his unkindness in sending him away, and his inconsistency in again seeking a conference with him. "We clearly saw." His prosperity was such as to be a manifest token of the Lord's favor. Hence, they desired the security of a treaty with him by an oath of execration on the transgressor. "Do us no hurt." The covenant is one-sided, as expressed by Abimelek. "As we have not touched thee." This implies the other side of the covenant. "Thou art now blessed of Yahweh." This explains the one-sidedness of the covenant. Isaac needed no guarantee from them, as the Lord was with him. Abimelek is familiar with the use of the name Yahweh. Isaac hospitably entertains and lodges the royal party, and on the morrow, after having sworn to the treaty, parts with them in peace. On the same day Isaac's servants report concerning the well they had digged <a href="/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a> that they had found water. This well he calls Sheba, "an oath," and hence the town is called Beer-sheba, "the well of the oath." Now the writer was aware that this place had received the same name on a former occasion <a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>. But a second well has now been dug in like circumstances in the same locality. This gives occasion for a new application of the name in the memories of the people. This is another illustration of the principle explained at <a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>. Two wells still exist at this place to attest the correctness of the record.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26-33. Then Abimelech went to him&#8212;As there was a lapse of ninety years between the visit of Abraham and of Isaac, the Abimelech and Phichol spoken of must have been different persons' official titles. Here is another proof of the promise (Ge 12:2) being fulfilled, in an overture of peace being made to him by the king of Gerar. By whatever motive the proposal was dictated&#8212;whether fear of his growing power, or regret for the bad usage they had given him, the king and two of his courtiers paid a visit to the tent of Isaac (Pr 16:7). His timid and passive temper had submitted to the annoyances of his rude neighbors; but now that they wish to renew the covenant, he evinces deep feeling at their conduct, and astonishment at their assurance, or artifice, in coming near him. Being, however, of a pacific disposition, Isaac forgave their offense, accepted their proposals, and treated them to the banquet by which the ratification of a covenant was usually crowned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We have not touched thee, </span> to wit, so as to injure or hurt thee, as above, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="/genesis/26-11.htm" title="And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.">Genesis 26:11</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou art now the blessed of the Lord; </span> or, O <span class="ital">thou who art now the with blessed of the Lord, </span> whom God hath enriched great and manifold blessings, which we did not take away from thee, as we could easily have done, but thou dost still enjoy them; and now art, as thou wert amongst us, <span class="ital">the blessed of the Lord.</span> Or, Seeing God hath blessed thee, it will not become thee to curse us, or to bear any grudge against us for that little unkindness which we expressed to thee.

Neither to our persons nor properties, to our kingdom and subjects, by invading our land, and seizing on our kingdom, all which was feared from Isaac's growing wealth and power: <p>as we have not touched thee; not done the least injury to him, to his person, family, and substance, but suffered him to go away with all he had untouched: <p>and as we have done unto thee, nothing but good; by royal authority, or by the command and direction of the king and his nobles; for as for the stopping up the wells his father's servants had dug, and the controversy that was about those in the vale, and the trouble Isaac had on that account, these things were not by the order of the king and council, and perhaps without their knowledge: <p>and have sent thee away in peace; no one being suffered to do any injury to him, or molest him in carrying off everything that belonged unto him: <p>thou art now blessed of the Lord; so it appeared by the prosperity he was attended with, and by the Lord's protection of him, and the constant and continual favours he was bestowing on him; and this induced Abimelech and his nobles to seek to cultivate friendship, and be on good terms with him. De Dieu gives a different sense of these words, and considers them in the form of an oath or imprecation,"if thou shouldest do us any hurt, seeing we have not touched thee, &amp;c. be thou now accursed of the Lord,''taking the word used in a contrary sense, as in <a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a> <a href="/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{l}</span> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou <i>art</i> now the blessed of the LORD.</span><p>(l) The Hebrews in swearing begin commonly with If and understand the rest, that is, that God will punish him who breaks the oath: here the wicked show that they are afraid lest that happen to them which they would do to others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">as we have … but good</span>] This statement, scarcely veracious in view of <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/26-15.htm" title="For all the wells which his father's servants had dig in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.">Genesis 26:15</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/26-20.htm" title="And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him....">Genesis 26:20-21</a></span>, is evidently made in the interests of policy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the blessed of the Lord</span>] Cf. <span class="ital"><a href="/genesis/26-12.htm" title="Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundred times: and the LORD blessed him.">Genesis 26:12</a></span> and <a href="/genesis/24-31.htm" title="And he said, Come in, you blessed of the LORD; why stand you without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.">Genesis 24:31</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thou wilt do us no hurt</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">if thou wilt do us evil</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. thy curse come upon thee!); the force being to negative in the strongest way possible any intention of injury (cf. <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">as we have not touched thee,</span> - i.e. injured thee; which was not true, as they, through their servants, had robbed Isaac of at least two wells - <span class="cmt_word">and as we have done unto thee nothing but good</span>, - Abimelech's estimate of his own behavior, if exceedingly favorable to himself, is at least natural (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and have sent thee away in peace</span> (without open violence certainly, because of Isaac's yielding, but scarcely without hostility): <span class="cmt_word">thou art now the blessed of the Lord</span>.
