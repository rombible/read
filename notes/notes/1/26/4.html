The real worth of God's promises cannot be lessened to a believer by any cross providences that may befall him. If God engage to be with us, and we are where he would have us to be, nothing but our own unbelief and distrust can prevent our comfort. The obedience of Abraham to the Divine command, was evidence of that faith, whereby, as a sinner, he was justified before God, and the effect of that love whereby true faith works. God testifies that he approved this obedience, to encourage others, especially Isaac.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Isaac is now the heir, and therefore the holder, of the promise. Hence, the Lord enters into communication with him. First, the present difficulty is met. "Go not down into Mizraim," the land of corn, even when other lands were barren. "Dwell in the land of which I shall tell thee." This reminds us of the message to Abraham <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>. The land here spoken of refers to "all these lands" mentioned in the following verses. "Sojourn in this land:" turn aside for the present, and take up thy temporary abode here. Next, the promise to Abraham is renewed with some variety of expression. "I will be with thee" <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>, a notable and comprehensive promise, afterward embodied in the name Immanuel, "God with us. Unto thee and unto thy seed." This was fulfilled to his seed in due time. All these lands, now parcelled out among several tribes. "And blessed in thy seed" <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>.<p>This is the great, universal promise to the whole human race through the seed of Abraham, twice explicitly announced to that patriarch. "All the nations." In constancy of purpose the Lord contemplates, even in the special covenant with Abraham, the gathering in of the nations under the covenant with Noah and with Adam <a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>. "Because Abraham hearkened to my voice," in all the great moments of his life, especially in the last act of proceeding on the divine command to offer Isaac himself. Abraham, by the faith which flows from the new birth, was united with the Lord, his shield and exceeding great reward <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>, with God Almighty, who quickened and strengthened him to walk before him and be perfect <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>. The Lord his righteousness worketh in him, and his merit is reflected and reproduced in him <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>, <a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>. Hence, the Lord reminds Isaac of the oath which he had heard at least fifty years before confirming the promise, and of the declaration then made that this oath of confirmation was sworn because Abraham had obeyed the voice of God. How deeply these words would penetrate into the soul of Isaac, the intended victim of that solemn day! But Abraham's obedience was displayed in all the acts of his new life. He kept the charge of God, the special commission he had given him; his commandments, his express or occasional orders; his statutes, his stated prescriptions, graven on stone; his laws, the great doctrines of moral obligation. This is that unreserved obedience which flows from a living faith, and withstands the temptations of the flesh.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 26<p>Ge 26:1-35.

Esau returned home one day from the field quite exhausted, and seeing Jacob with a dish of lentils, still a favourite dish in Syria and Egypt, he asked with passionate eagerness for some to eat: "Let me swallow some of that red, that red there;" &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, the brown-red lentil pottage. From this he received the name Edom, just as among the ancient Arabians persons received names from quite accidental circumstances, which entirely obscured their proper names. Jacob made us of his brother's hunger to get him to sell his birthright. The birthright consisted afterwards in a double portion of the father's inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>); but with the patriarchs it embraced the chieftainship, the rule over the brethren and the entire family (<a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>), and the title to the blessing of the promise (<a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-4.htm">Genesis 27:4</a>, <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27-29</a>), which included the future possession of Canaan and of covenant fellowship with Jehovah (<a href="/genesis/28-4.htm">Genesis 28:4</a>). Jacob knew this, and it led him to anticipate the purposes of God. Esau also knew it, but attached no value to it. There is proof enough that he knew he was giving away, along with the birthright, blessings which, because they were not of a material but of a spiritual nature, had no particular value in his estimation, in the words he made use of: "Behold I am going to die (to meet death), and what is the birthright to me?" The only thing of value to him was the sensual enjoyment of the present; the spiritual blessings of the future his carnal mind was unable to estimate. In this he showed himself to be &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>), a profane man, who cared for nothing but the momentary gratification of sensual desires, who "did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way, and so despised his birthright" (<a href="/genesis/25-34.htm">Genesis 25:34</a>). With these words the Scriptures judge and condemn the conduct of Esau. Just as Ishmael was excluded from the promised blessing because he was begotten "according to the flesh," so Esau lost it because his disposition was according to the flesh. The frivolity with which he sold his birthright to his brother for a dish of lentils, rendered him unfit to be the heir and possessor of the promised grace. But this did not justify Jacob's conduct in the matter. Though not condemned here, yet in the further course of the history it is shown to have been wrong, by the simple fact that he did not venture to make this transaction the basis of a claim. </body></html>
