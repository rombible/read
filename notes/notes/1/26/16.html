Be it observed, for the encouragement of poor tenants who occupy other people's lands, and are honest and industrious, that God blessed him with a great increase. The Philistines envied Isaac. It is an instance of the vanity of the world; for the more men have of it, the more they are envied, and exposed to censure and injury. Also of the corruption of nature; for that is an ill principle indeed, which makes men grieve at the good of others. They made Isaac go out of their country. That wisdom which is from above, will teach us to give up our right, and to draw back from contentions. If we are wrongfully driven from one place, the Lord will make room for us in another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The growing prosperity of Isaac. "And Isaac sowed in that land." This does not imply a fixed property in the soil, but only an annual tenancy. "A hundred-fold." The rates of increase vary from thirty to a hundred. Sixty-fold is very good, and was not unusual in Palestine. A hundred-fold was rare, and only in spots of extraordinary fertility. Babylonia, however, yielded two hundred and even three hundred-fold, according to Herodotus (I. 193). Thus, the Lord began to "bless him." The amazing growth of the stranger's wealth in flocks and herds and servants awakens the envy of the inhabitants. The digging of the well was an enterprise of great interest in rural affairs. It conferred a sort of ownership on the digger, especially in a country where water was precious. And in a primeval state of society the well was the scene of youthful maidens drawing water for domestic use, and of young men and sometimes maidens watering the bleating flocks and lowing herds, and therefore the gathering center of settled life. Hence, the envious Philistines were afraid that from a sojourner he would go on to be a settler, and acquire rights of property. They accordingly took the most effectual means of making his abiding place uncomfortable, when they stopped up the wells. At length the sovereign advised a separation, if he did not enjoin the departure of Isaac.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/jfb/genesis/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. all the wells which his father's servants had digged &#8230; the Philistines had stopped, &c.&#8212;The same base stratagem for annoying those against whom they have taken an umbrage is practiced still by choking the wells with sand or stones, or defiling them with putrid carcases.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/poole/genesis/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which breeds envy, and jealousy, and fear among my subjects, and may occasion greater mischiefs; and therefore it is better that we should part friends, than by continuing together be turned into enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gill/genesis/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, go from us,.... Which was either said by way of advice, consulting Isaac's good, and the peace of his own kingdom; or else by way of command, enjoining him to depart, having a secret envy to him himself, or at least was jealous of his growing power and wealth: <p>for thou art much mightier than we; in riches or goods, as the Targum of Jonathan adds; or in number; his family being greatly increased, his servants numerous, many being born of them in his house; Abraham had three hundred and eighteen trained servants in his house, <a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>; how many Isaac had is not certain; they must be a large number for Abimelech to fear anything from them. Some choose to interpret the words, thou hast increased, or thou hast got much from us, and by us; and therefore it is high time for thee to be gone from us. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/gsb/genesis/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/cambridge/genesis/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">Go from us</span>] Abimelech recognized that, after such conduct on the part of his people, it would be best in the interests of peace that Isaac should withdraw. Isaac’s attitude is one of concession and compliance towards the people among whom he sojourns. He is the type of the race that grows rich, but excites envy and hatred in the land of its sojourn.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abimelech said unto Isaac</span> (almost leading to the suspicion that the Philistine monarch had instigated the outbreak of hostilities amongst his people), <span class="cmt_word">Go from us</span> (a royal command rather than a friendly advice); <span class="cmt_word">for thou art much mightier than we</span>. The same apprehension of the growing numbers and strength of Isaac's descendants in Egypt took possession of the heart of Pharaoh, and led to their enslavement (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/kad/genesis/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Protection of Rebekah at Gerar. - As Abraham had declared his wife to be his sister both in Egypt and at Gerar, so did Isaac also in the latter place. But the manner in which God protected Rebekah was very different from that in which Sarah was preserved in both instances. Before any one had touched Rebekah, the Philistine king discovered the untruthfulness of Isaac's statement, having seen Isaac "sporting with Rebekah," sc., in a manner to show that she was his wife; whereupon he reproved Isaac for what he had said, and forbade any of his people to touch Rebekah on pain of death. Whether this was the same Abimelech as the one mentioned in <a href="//biblehub.com/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a> cannot be decided with certainty. The name proves nothing, for it was the standing official name of the kings of Gerar (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/21-11.htm">1 Samuel 21:11</a> and <a href="//biblehub.com/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>), as Pharaoh was of the kings of Egypt. The identity is favoured by the pious conduct of Abimelech in both instances; and no difficulty is caused either by the circumstance that 80 years had elapsed between the two events (for Abraham had only been dead five years, and the age of 150 was no rarity then), or by the fact, that whereas the first Abimelech had Sarah taken into his harem, the second not only had no intention of doing this, but was anxious to protect her from his people, inasmuch as it would be all the easier to conceive of this in the case of the same king, on the ground of his advanced age. </body></html>
