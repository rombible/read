Judging of Joseph from the general temper of human nature, they thought he would now avenge himself on those who hated and injured him without cause. Not being able to resist, or to flee away, they attempted to soften him by humbling themselves. They pleaded with him as the servants of Jacob's God. Joseph was much affected at seeing this complete fulfilment of his dreams. He directs them not to fear him, but to fear God; to humble themselves before the Lord, and to seek the Divine forgiveness. He assures them of his own kindness to them. See what an excellent spirit Joseph was of, and learn of him to render good for evil. He comforted them, and, to banish all their fears, he spake kindly to them. Broken spirits must be bound up and encouraged. Those we love and forgive, we must not only do well for, but speak kindly to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/barnes/genesis/50.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His brethren supplicate Joseph for forgiveness. "They sent unto Joseph," commissioned one of their number to speak to him. now that our common father has given us this command. "And Joseph wept" at the distress and doubt of his brothers. He no doubt summons them before him, when they fall down before him entreating his forgiveness. Joseph removes their fears. "Am I in God's stead?" that I should take the law into my own hands, and take revenge. God has already judged them, and moreover turned their sinful deed into a blessing.

The sentence contains an aposiopesis, like <a href="/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>; and &#1500;&#1493;&#1468; with the imperfect presupposes a condition, being used "in cases which are not desired, and for the present not real, though perhaps possible" (Ew. 358). The brethren therefore deputed one of their number (possibly Benjamin) to Joseph, and instructed him to appeal to the wish expressed by their father before his death, and to implore forgiveness: "O pardon the misdeed of thy brethren and their sin, that they have done thee evil; and now grant forgiveness to the misdeed of the servants of the God of thy father." The ground of their plea is contained in &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; "and now," sc., as we request it by the desire and direction of our father, and in the epithet applied to themselves, "servants of the God of thy father." There is no reason whatever for regarding the appeal to their father's wish as a mere pretence. The fact that no reference was made by Jacob in his blessing to their sin against Joseph, merely proved that he as their father had forgiven the sin of his sons, since the grace of God had made their misdeed the means of Israel's salvation; but it by no means proves that he could not have instructed his sons humbly to beg for forgiveness from Joseph, even though Joseph had hitherto shown them only goodness and love. How far Joseph was from thinking of ultimate retribution and revenge, is evident from the reception which he gave to their request (<a href="/genesis/50-17.htm">Genesis 50:17</a>): "Joseph wept at their address to him." viz., at the fact that they could impute anything so bad to him; and when they came themselves, and threw themselves as servants at his feet, he said to them (<a href="/genesis/50-19.htm">Genesis 50:19</a>), "Fear not, for am I in the place of God?" i.e., am I in a position to interfere of my own accord with the purposes of God, and not rather bound to submit to them myself? "Ye had indeed evil against me in your mind, but God had it in mind for good (to turn this evil into good), to do (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; like &#1493;&#1488;&#1492; <a href="/genesis/48-11.htm">Genesis 48:11</a>), as is now evident (lit., as has occurred this day, cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>; <a href="//biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>, etc.), to preserve alive a great nation (cf. <a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). And now fear not, I shall provide for you and your families." Thus he quieted them by his affectionate words. </body></html>
